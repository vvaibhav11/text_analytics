0,24 hour delay which was not acceptable,Tony Harris,TripVerified,"  Flight from Sydney to Montreal cancelled on 05 February, automatically rebooked on the next day flight. A 24 hour delay which was not acceptable to me - only seat available on the 06 February flight from Sydney to Toronto and then Vancouver and Smithers was business class when I went online to book .. so I paid $3,900 for a flight which is normally less than a $1,000 eco and $2,000 business but I needed to be in Smithers on 06 February. I arrived in Toronto 15 min late with a 45 min connection I received a text message saying I had been rebooked to the 15:20 flight meaning I then had an 18 hour stopover in Vancouver and arrived in Smithers on 07 February. I go to the gate of my original flight and people still boarding .. they say I have been rebooked as my baggage would not make it and nothing they could do I needed to go back to the service desk - on the way back to the service desk I get a text message saying my original flight was going to be leaving 20 min late, so back to the original 45 min on which the ticket was sold - service desks gets me a seat on the 9am from Toronto to Vancouver in economy as no business seats. Flight from Toronto to Vancouver is now 60 min late due to late servicing of the plane and we are all boarded and sat waiting.",6th February 2022,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Vancouver,Feb-22,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1
1,Worst airline ever,S Deane,TripVerified,"  Air Canada’s website booked me with another airline’s flight to connect to their airline’s flight. The flight prior to my Air Canada flight was canceled for holiday, so I got into contact with that airline and they said since I booked through Air Canada, they would not be able to resolve the issue. I talked to Air Canada (via messenger because no one answered the phone) and was told it was the responsibility of the other airline to get me to my final destination, even though I was booked through Air Canada. There are no human customer service representatives at Narita Airport today, on top of that. At this point I cannot even get a refund on a $1000 ticket. Worst airline ever, I will not make this mistake again.",3rd February 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Seattle via Seoul / Vancouver,Feb-22,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
2,the staff had no power to act,Collins Mazraani,TripVerified,"  I had booked business class for my mother and for me I had booked economy. I wanted to upgrade my reservation for business. With the covid it was necessary to pass a test before leaving 48 hours before departure. While the possibility of raising the category of the seat was open up to 48 hours before departure. So I had the trouble of doing this upgrade, because the possibility was closed on the website, at the airport in Beirut, with my agency in Montreal, etc. I arrive on the gate at London airport after a stopover. they tell me that now it's too late to do the enhancement. The seats in the business section were almost empty and the staff had no power to act, all they tell you is company policy. I asked to pay for the upgrade, or to accommodate myself with an upgrade because my mother is an elderly person and she does not speak the language. They said they will take good care of my mother, something they did well but my mother did not feel comfortable because of the language barrier and they did not want to disturb the business section while during the 7.5 hour flight I was able to go see my mother 4 times only for 1 min only, so as not to disturb. I find that Air Canada does not give any power to act to its employees and it should have put a travel manager who listens to passengers and that we have the tools so that they can do the impossible to satisfy its clientele.  J'avais réservé business class pour ma mère et pour moi j'avais réservé économie. je voulais rehaussé ma réservation pour business. Avec le covid il fallait passé un test avant de partir 48 heure avant le départ. Alors que la possibilité de rehaussé la catégorie du siège était ouvert jusqu'à 48 heure avant le départ. Alors j'ai eu la misère de faire ce rehaussement, car la possibilité était fermé sur le site web, à l'aéroport de beirut, avec mon agence de Montreal etc. j'arrive sur le gate à l'aéroport de londre après un escale. ils me disent que maintenant c'est trop tard de faire le rehaussement.  Les sièges de la section business était presque vide et le personnel n'ont aucun pouvoir d'agir. tout ce qu'il te disent que c'est la politique de la cie. j'ai demandé de payer le rehaussement, ou de m'accomoder avec un rehaussement car ma mère est une personne âgée et elle ne maîtrise pas la langue. ils ont fit qu'ils vont bien s'occuper de ma mère, une chose qu'ils ont bien fait mais ma mère ne se sentait pas confortables à cause de la barrière langue et ils ne voulait pas déranger la section business alors que pendant le vol de 7.5 heure j'ai pu aller voir ma mère 4 fois seulement pendant 1 min seulement, pour ne pas déranger. je trouve que air Canada ne donne aucun pouvoir d'agir à ses employés et il aurait dû mettre un chef de voyage qui soit à l'écoute des passagers et qu'on l'outil pour qu'il puissent faire l'impossible pour satisfaite sa clientèle.",27th January 2022,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Montreal ,Jan-22,2,3,1,2,1,4,2,1
3,Absolutely the worst airline,Shawn Holden,NotVerified," Houston to Prince George. They cancelled my flight from Houston to Prince George over 5 times (I lost count) due to Covid and gave me a travel credit that was emailed back to me. I have tried to redeem the credit. I have called 5 times to ""customer service"", I use that term with hesitation, hung up on 4 times, put back on hold because the travel credit code that they emailed me does not match any records. 45 minutes later, they tell me my flight credits are about to expire and are under another credit code and I have to change those flight credits into a flight voucher but that will take 2 months to get my travel voucher. How does a company in 2022 take 2 Months to give you your flight credits that you paid for? I can return something on my Chase Credit Card and get instant credit but it takes 2 months to transfer credit internally at Air Canada. (The only think I can figure is that this is a technique that the Air Canada uses to take your flight credit or make you wait until the ticket prices go up and charge you more money.) Absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with in my life of travel.",25th January 2022,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Prince George,Feb-21,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1
4,I was not reimbursed for charges,G Ragami,TripVerified,  Air Canada cancelled my flights twice so I had to pay additional charges to change my flight for last part of my trip with United twice. I had to stay in airport hotel in Chicago. I was not reimbursed for charges related to cancelled flights by Air Canada and the staff at Chicago airport were very unhelpful when I asked for help regarding the process for refund. I will not fly with Air Canada and do not recommend it.,18th January 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Saskatoon to Chicago via Toronto ,Dec-21,2,2,2,0,1,0,1,1
5,on flight they ran out of meals,G Bardon,TripVerified,"  During a snow storm we sat on plane at gate for 3 hours, then deicing another 1.5 hrs, but this was not their fault. Then for the meal on flight they ran out of meals. Absolutely poor planning as they had 3 hours to figure this out.",18th January 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Vancouver ,Jan-22,2,2,1,4,1,1,2,1
6,the corners they cut in customer service on the plane is ludicrous,H Maresh,TripVerified," The seats were comfy, the staff were nice, the airplane of decent quality, the entertainment system was brilliant and so on. However, where it all goes wrong is the policies of Air Canada. Under no circumstances will they provide you with anything more than a glass of water on your journey. Its a 4 hour journey, how about some chips or crackers?  Want to experience their brilliant entertainment system? Better purchase some headphones at a ridiculous price. Its rather ridiculous when you consider Air Canada maintains prices that are 3 times higher than cheap budget airlines with Flair. - you get marginally better customer service off the plane, and a carry-on, but not much else.  This flight was delayed by an hour.  WiFi is significantly worse than Qatar Airways at a much worse price. ",15th January 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Edmonton,Jan-22,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
7,practically a monopoly,S Jenson,TripVerified," Montreal to Los Angeles. Air Canada always go the extra mile to make your life miserable as a passenger. One example, when I have a 6:30 layover in Montreal while the airport is empty and most businesses closed I am unable to pay for lounge access, I am told you need to book ahead. Of course, I never seen any mentions of that before and no other airline do this kind of thing. I could see their lounge is mostly empty. They absolutely don't care about the passengers. If the company was not practically a monopoly and continually sponsored by my taxes and those of all Canadians, I wouldn't be so angry about it. But the truth is, as a Canadian, you are despised by your national transporter but you have no choice to fly AC and sponsor the airline with your taxes. Oh Canada",9th January 2022,Business,Premium Economy,Montreal to Los Angeles,Jan-22,3,4,2,4,1,0,2,1
8,cabin crew was rude to me,A Maladi,TripVerified,"  The flight time was changed at least 3 times before the flight.  On the flight, most of the cabin crew was rude to me, yelling at me for trivial matters (like changing your seat) even though their colleague said it was ok.  If you ask for a snack or a drink on a 14 hour flight, expect a dry and short response.  For me, the flight experience was uncomfortable. Forget about ever reaching them if you try calling customer service internationally. Impossible. If you try calling them from within Canada, expect to wait on the line for 1-2 hours.",8th January 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Doha,Dec-21,3,1,1,3,2,0,2,1
9,Frustrating to say the least,D Fry,TripVerified,"  Frustrating to say the least, I had to pack my patience. Went to visit my in-laws for the holiday as they are getting older and my mother-in-law really wanted us to visit. My husband and I got the the family together to travel we flew out of Orlando on Christmas day which was reasonable enough I give a pass to the attitude of the staff because it is Christmas day but the horrible part is returning home. We got all of our COVID test done on New Years Eve as we were traveling on New Year's Day, got to the airport in plenty of time(t3 hours ahead) and the incompetence was just mind boggling but we got through and told our bags would be checked all the way through to Orlando as we would pre-clear customs in Montreal and then head to Orlando. Well this is where it went batshit crazy. Our flight out of Vancouver was delayed by an hour we got into Montreal and Air Canada lost one of our bags so we were held up in US immigration because we couldn't clear customs without that one bag (which was mine) of course my family didn't leave me we all were stuck. At the last minute the agent filed a missing bag for to allow us to go through he then called the flight attendant on the plane we were scheduled to leave on and she was so rude and refused to hold the plane for five minutes so my family and I could run the 100m dash to the gate. We got through finally and yes they left us even though it was their fault we missed the connection. Had to trek down to the baggage department with absolutely do direction or help from Air Canada. We finally got back to the departures in Montreal after collecting our remaining bags and a bit of luck we ended up with an agent that was actually concerned and nice for the first time in this whole ordeal. She booked us on a flight in the morning and she arranged to put us up at a near by Marriott and $80 in meal vouchers she was amazing, it gave me hope. Got back to the hotel in Montreal only to get an email that the flight she booked us on in the morning was cancelled and we are now being bumped on to a Delta Flight through Atlanta into Orlando. We never arrived in Orlando until January 3 at midnight. If it hand not being for Air Canada incompetence, the selfish, inconsiderate flight attendant and the laid back agent at customs this could have been avoided. I am back home and still don't have my bag and they are trying to get out it. ",7th January 2022,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Vancouver via Montreal,Jan-22,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,1
10,baggage was delayed when connecting in Toronto,S Galirez,TripVerified,"  I have rarely had a connecting flight through Toronto Pearson Airport without my baggage being delayed. My flight from Las Vegas to Toronto was delayed twice and, even if I originally had a 3-hour layover to make it to my final flight, I had to run through customs, vaccination checkpoints and through security to make it to my connecting flight. I was told that my baggage was checked all the way to my final destination, but apparently it was not. I barely made it to my gate while the last passengers were boarding and in the end the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. At my final destination, half of the passengers had to line up at Customer Services because their baggage was delayed when connecting in Toronto. I was told that my baggage would be delivered at my address the following day, but it still has not been delivered. I spent one hour trying to contact a Representative on the phone to know if my baggage was on route (at 9.30pm) or at least if they could give me an idea of when I should expect it. However, when the person finally picked up, they could not tell me if it would be delivered on the following hours or the next morning. From now on I will avoid any connecting flights at Toronto Pearson Airport and, if possible, travelling with Air Canada.",5th January 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Montreal via Toronto,Jan-22,3,3,2,3,1,1,2,2
11,I have never flown Air Canada and not had a problem,D Edwards,TripVerified," I have never flown Air Canada and not had a problem. Their flights never leave on time, I have never made a connection with them before and getting a new ticket is impossible because their customer service is no good. You would think the biggest airline in the country can afford to hire enough reps so there is not a 3 hour wait to talk to someone. I will never ever ever fly AC again. Also the only airline I’ve ever flown that doesn’t give complimentary drinks or snacks they squeeze every last penny they can. Such a joke. They’ve managed to ruin all my vacations in the last 3 years.",4th January 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Timmins,Jan-22,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,2
12,"cancelled, delayed, or changed",M Parker,TripVerified," Toronto to Quebec City. Every flight I purchase using Air Canada, it is either cancelled, delayed, or changed for a much more inconvenient flight.

13,terrible customer service,E Kean,TripVerified,"  Canceled the flight 30 min after the boarding would have started, no rebooking, basically just said “you’re on your own, call this number and try to rebook your flight on this busy week”. I did manage to get to Vancouver on the next day, and then when I had a return trip they forgot my baggage at Vancouver. The baggage should’ve arrived like 4 hours ago, but unfortunately no one in the airport from Air Canada can be bothered to check so I’m celebrating new year without any clothes and 5% on my phone.  Terrible company with terrible customer service.",1st January 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Prince George to Vancouver,Dec-21,3,1,0,0,1,0,1,2
14,one had no pilot and the other no fuel,John Smithers,NotVerified,"  Pilot showed up 20 minutes late to an already delayed flight. Crew provides drink and meal service and disappears, never to be seen again until the end of the flight. As if these aren’t bad enough, after boarding my connecting flight (also delayed - by over an hour) we are notified via PA that the plane isn’t fuelled. Reflecting on my flights this day, one had no pilot and the other no fuel. I don’t have to explain how unprofessional and frankly pathetic this service is. The problem is we Canadians don’t have any other choice for an airline, so we pay a premium for inferior planes, services, and routes. In the future my family will fly US airlines to avoid this headache. ",28th December 2021,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Toronto,Dec-21,3,3,2,0,1,0,1,2
15,Don’t use this airline - terribly inconsiderate,Camille Poulin,TripVerified," Absolutely awful experience! First, they cancel our flight and book us on a flight leaving 2 hours later. Then, they make us sit on the plane waiting for multiple hours, telling us every 35 minutes that we have to wait another 35 minutes because a few people were late! Had to cancel my plans. Don’t use this airline - terribly inconsiderate.",23rd December 2021,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Montreal,Dec-21,4,4,2,4,1,1,1,2
16,Save yourselves the headache,C Baiyam,TripVerified,"  Worst flight experience of my life. I had to switch my flight to a connecting flight which was delayed. The airline automatically rebooked my connecting flight because they were unable to transfer my bags in time, even though we made it to our gate with an hour to spare. Resulted in unnecessary travel costs of more than $200 because the new flight landed after the rental kiosk closed. Had to drive over an hour out of the city via Uber then taxi back to the airport. Ended up traveling for 10 hours more than I needed to. Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this airline at all costs. Oh, and not to mention COVID restrictions make it much much worse.

17,The worst business class flight in my life,M Moore,TripVerified, The worst business class flight in my life. Someone at Air Canada decided to assign me a gluten free meal which is beyond depressing. The food looked as if it came from economy class. Since I did not request gluten free I was generously offered to pick from the menu from “what is left”. Plastic plates and paper tray with plastic utensils = Air Canada business class.,14th December 2021,Business,Business Class,Toronto to London,Dec-21,3,2,1,4,3,3,1,2
18,last time to use Air Canada,K Young,TripVerified," Los Angeles to Incheon via Vancouver. I am still waiting for the flight. This flight was supposed to be departed at 12:55pm at the gate D69 but then all of sudden they changed the gate without any announcement. I saw the different gate (gate D72) and went to the gate. I saw all passengers did same thing I did. In addition, they announced after 1pm the delay of the flight departing at 1440. So I was expecting that boarding would start at 1400 but nothing happened and then I went to the crew asking what is going on. Then the crew said she was just waiting for the plane to arrive at the gate and did not give me the time window with so rude attitude. After that one crew announce that they were just waiting for more information at 1400. Also another announcement stated that they were just waiting for the plane at 1430 without any apology. This will be my last time to use Air Canada.",13th December 2021,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Incheon via Vancouver,Dec-21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2
19,never experienced such good customer service,K Deane,TripVerified,"  I brought some collapsible hiking poles in my carry-on luggage from Washington DC through Toronto to Calgary on my outbound trip, and then from Calgary to Toronto on my return trip, with no issues from security. But then during a separate pre-US arrival security screening from Toronto to Washington DC, I was told by security that I could not travel with them in my carry-on luggage and my only choices were to abandon them or try to speak to an Air Canada representative to put them in an additional checked bag. After deciding on the latter because of the value of the items, the Air Canada rep I spoke to, went out of his way to shepherd my sister and I all the way out through customs and back in again through security, getting us to the front of the line when he could and when it was appropriate, so that we could make our connecting flight on time. I have never experienced such good customer service with an airline like that before (despite the original issue with my carry-on item). Aside from that, all Air Canada staff we encountered were very friendly and we had no issues on our flights, despite a brief mechanical delay at one point, which is pretty typical nowadays. The economy seats on our flights, for all legs, also seemed a bit roomier than many US airlines.",12th December 2021,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Washington via Toronto,Dec-21,4,5,3,4,4,0,5,2
20,They have good customer-facing people,P Gerlen,TripVerified,"  When everything goes smoothly, Air Canada is a good airline to fly with. The major problem with them is experiencing how they handle unexpected issues along the way. We were bumped off our flight from Vancouver to Tokyo because we wouldn't make our connection there and at the time, Japan didn't allow stay-overs in the country bacause of strict Covid restrictions. The way the passengers affected were treated from the time we got off the aircraft to the time we were re-booked on another flight the following day was horrible. They have good customer-facing people who are doing their best to deal with such situations, but as a major organization, their leadership never gives them the tools or budget to deal with it appropriately. They need to make major improvements in dealing with crisis situations as they occur. Increased authority at a mid-level management would certainly be a good first step. The managers appear to be doing their best to accomodate the stressful transitioning of customers throughout the airport, but they clearly lack discretionary budgets to keep customers comfortable during the process. No food, drink or emergency staff increases to deal with any of it. Every customer is treated like cattle, running through the loops on their own, not knowing where to go in the terminal to address the next steps, etc. I am rating Air Canada on a corporate level, not on an individual customer-facing staff level.",10th December 2021,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Montreal to Tokyo via Vancouver,Dec-21,2,3,2,3,2,1,2,3
21,the result that of wrong judgement,N Horten,TripVerified,"  They do not know to keep time. They delayed our flight for a reason that could be avoided. And on top of that they assumed the authority to cancel our connecting flight without communicating to us their decision, leaving us for hours, at the Heathrow airport. The decision to cancel our flight was the result that of wrong judgement. Because the flight from Toronto delayed for 15 minutes they took the decision to cancel our connection flight, but do not have the courtesy to inform us of their decision.",29th November 2021,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to London ,Nov-21,4,3,2,4,3,0,2,3

24,Their customer service is brutal,I Makyik,NotVerified,"  I have traveled with AC for over 20 years, mainly due to them being the preferred airline of the company I work. They are an over priced under service airline at best. Their customer service is brutal. Recently I needed to speak to someone live in customer service. I have been on hold for over 5 hours. What company that values even the slightest customer satisfaction offers this poor a service? It is an absolute shame Canadian does not have another national airline. As sad as it is I will no longer fly AC and opt for a US carrier instead. Shame on AC senior management.

25,my diabetic meal did not make it on board,P Martin,TripVerified," I am a diabetic. On my flight from Toronto to Vienna, in Sept 2021 I was informed that my diabetic meal did not make it on board. I was not offered any alternative, just the comment: Sorry, we didn't load your meal. Flight 1 -hungry! On my flight back on Oct 12, I was offered a ""diabetic meal"", containing pasta (main course), bread etc. I need to inform AC that pasta is not recommended for diabetics, maybe consult a dietician for advise. Flight 2 -hungry! On top of that they lost one piece of luggage on our arrival in Toronto. We were told: ""The luggage made it to Toronto (it was unloaded) but we cannot find it"". It was delivered after 10 days at 5.30am with no advanced notice. Anyway, at least they found it! We filed two formal complaints for the meal and the luggage. $100 dollars off for the meal and 20% off the next booking for the luggage. Measly. When we booked out next trip we found out that the two discounts we re not recognized by the booking website.

26,I really enjoyed this flight,M Hane,TripVerified,"  I really enjoyed this flight. The flight attendants offered excellent service. There was a good selection of wines. The dinner was good but I would have appreciate a third option for the main course. I particularly enjoyed watching the films, documentaries and TV shows. When I am flying longer routes I always try to book on a plane with Signature Service. It's nice to see they've brought that back. I also enjoyed the AC lounge and have a bite to eat and a glass of wine and some water before my flight. The seats are really comfortable and with the seat facing the window, it feels nicely private. I also appreciated the health protocols followed by the AC staff.

So I canceled my hotel in Orlando with penalty fee of US 98.10 because Air Canada said that they will provide hotel in Fort Lauderdale! When I arrived in Toronto, Air Canada rebooked again to the next flight to Montreal and Orlando.. everything was delayed and in a hurry and super stressful! Now I don't have place to stay in Orlando tonight because I canceled the hotel.

Air Canada has the worst customer service I have experienced. As I write this, I am on hold with Air Canada and have been on hold for 1 hour 27 minutes and counting, and this is my second call to confirm an upgrade which was accepted on line but without final confirmation. For reasons unknown, Air Canada does not make extensive (or any) use of chat bots or chat lines and it clearly is seriously understaffed.

29,the company doesn’t value you the customers,J Del Rio,NotVerified,"  This airline has the worst customer service. I needed assistance on a short notice change in my flight and needed to meet the COVID requirements. I wasn’t looking to violate rules I was looking for assistance. The staff with Air Canada weren’t just rude they are completely uncaring! You could tell that the company doesn’t value you the customers nor does it value the customer experience. Specialize in saying “No, we don’t know how to assist.” I understood I needed to meet testing requirements and follow whatever policy stated but when I had follow up questions — I was dismissed and even told to talk to United! IAH Airport staff for Air Canada just want a check, they don’t want to help you. Again, they do care about your experience! No company integrity. No company value. Luckily United did indeed step up and completely changed my experience. Horrible time with Air Canada and I believe any competitors could easily out shine them if your staff smiles alone!

30,disgusted with the way the flight attendants are on the flight,Julian Iccello,TripVerified, I am absolutely disgusted with the way the flight attendants are on the flight. Very rude. My concern is the following. 1) Empty plane - meaning all business class and first class had very minimal seats taken. I have Multiple Sclerosis and have zero feeling in my right leg (needs to stay straight or else I will cramp). I had spoken to Air Canada on the phone and they said to me to speak to the attendants when the plane is fully boarded and if there is any space they will move you up. They said. No Sir. You did not pay for any upgrades so we cannot move you up to the empty seats. What a joke.,14th October 2021,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Toronto to Kingston,Oct-21,1,1,1,1,2,5,2,4
31,They are delayed every flight,D Porter,NotVerified,  I have been on multiple flights with Air Canada in the last 3 months. They are delayed every flight.

32,Most of the staff are rude,Faith White,TripVerified,"  My flight was canceled numerous times after purchase. Last change was made while I was in the air, coming from Los Angeles to Toronto. By the time we landed in Toronto, we were told flight to Halifax had left. We had to search and pay for overnight lodging which was not easy as most hotels were already booked. Next morning we went back to airport and finally made it to Halifax where we missed the wedding we were here to attend. Upon arriving Halifax airport, our luggage was missing; taken by another passenger even though the airline stated our luggage would have been secured. Most of the staff are rude, has no regard for other people's feelings or properties.

Excellent website, clear flight info and updates, OK checkin, good boarding, excellent newly refurbished aircraft with very comfortable premium economy seating, good cabin ambience, minimum but informative announcements from the cockpit, nice meal and nicely presented on the tray with proper cutlery etc. and large clear personal TV with OK selection of media. The Montreal based onboard crew were ruined by the behaviour of some of the crew even when addressed in fluent first language French. Service on a 8 hour gate to gate flight amounted to 2 very brief per functional pass throughs with zero regular cabin checks. Crew were mostly in front and back galleys conversing in “non-Covid” close proximity. What really stood out was how aggressive the crew was. Tons of Corona related announcements and edicts.  Bring your own drinks and snack even when in Premium Economy.",9th October 2021,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Toronto,Oct-21,5,1,4,4,4,0,5,4
34,I was truly disgusted with the service from the airline,Meredith Drost,TripVerified," I am a fairly frequent solo traveler (3-5 flights per year at a minimum) and this was the most disgusting experience I have had with an airline from the cancelation 7 hours before my flight in the middle of the night to the 24 hours delayed arrival to my destination. I had a flight booked for Sunday, August 29th, 2021 scheduled to depart at 7.00 am. I was in town for a wedding and this flight was a one-way direct flight from Halifax, NS to Toronto, ON. At 11.00 pm I received an email from the airline notifying me my flight was canceled ""Due to weather"". I called Air Canada to rebook my flight and after waiting on hold for 2 hours I got through to an agent who would only rebook my flight if I paid an additional fare. He advised me if I wanted another flight for the next day I could get on an 11.00 am flight for an additional $600 or a 7.00 pm flight for an additional $300. This is in addition to the $400 I paid for the initial flight. After much back and forth I requested a supervisor at which point he transfers me through, the supervisor introduces himself, and as I begin speaking he proceeds to hang up on me. I was infuriated as it was late at night and I had nowhere to go and no flight for the next morning. The next day, I call the airline back in the morning (attempting to get someone who would put me on the 11.00 am flight without charging double the amount of the original ticket). I was transferred several times, and on the phone for a total of 5 hours before securing a flight that evening at 7.00 pm and was required to pay the amount of the original flight and they said they would refund the initial ticket (total paid before a refund is not $800 for the flight that was $400 when purchased 2 months before the flight). However, my flight was now scheduled to go to Newfoundland overnight and then in the morning depart to Montreal then Toronto for my final destination. The agent on the phone advised me that when I arrived in NFLD they would be able to help with the hotel situation. I ended up having to pay for the hotel out of pocket ($150 for the hotel + the $800 for the flight = $950 trip so far) when I arrived at the airport because the agents had no idea what I was talking about. Finally, the next morning at 9 am (26 hours after my regional flight and $950 dollars later) I arrive in Toronto. When I get here, not surprisingly, my bags did not make it. They were delivered to my location a day and a half later. I wanted to leave this review to share my experience with Air Canada. I was truly disgusted with the service from the airline, the fact that it is incredibly challenging to speak to anyone, the fact that Air Canada treats its clients as numbers, and the fact that this conglomerate is a company solely focused on making money and has little care about the people affected on their flights. Things may seem okay with this airline when nothing goes wrong (which is seldom) but when it does go wrong, expect your trip to cost more and to spend hours online trying to talk to someone.",4th October 2021,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Halifax, Nova Scotia to Toronto, Ontario",Aug-21,1,3,0,0,1,0,1,4
35,Overall good flights and service,John Attersley,TripVerified,"  An early morning departure from Penticton, BC, check in staff very good and checked in quickly. Flight good and onboard staff pleasant, short flight so not much service offered or expected. The Q400 was an all economy flight but seated in row 2. Vancouver layover good, the lounge not back to pre-covid offerings yet, staff pleasant. Flight from Vancouver on the 787 Signature Class, the boarding was a bit delayed with no explanations given, boarding ok. Service onboard very good and the breakfast done very well and no complaints. Staff efficient. IFE worked well, pleanty of choice for the length of flight. Seat comfortable. As it was a daytime flight I did not use the flat bed but bedding was provided. Layover in Toronto 4 hours in the lounge, again not back to pre-covid as far a food options go. This lounge could use a make over as it is getting a bit tired. Last flight 737 Max, staff very good, food and beverage service good IFE worked well.

36,This is the worst experience!,Seyed Mehdi Mirarabshahi,TripVerified," Air Canada customer service is the worst I have ever seen. I have a flight back to the USA for October 2. They changed it from 12.30 am to 12.25 am and asked me to confirm. When I go the the link to confirm it says call Air Canada, when I call them it says I should wait two hours to talk with an agent. I tried several times and could not talk to an agent to only confirm the 5 min change in my flight! I tried their website and there is no way to confirm! This is the worst experience!

41,slightly above-average,W James,TripVerified," Flying with Air Canada can be best described as slightly above-average. Not at all great, but most certainly not bad. The check-in agent in Portland who reviewed my flight and pandemic paperwork (to satisfy Canada's requirements) was very serious but also pleasant and helpful. The departure gate was relatively new, as well as secluded and quiet. The Portland gate agent was also courteous. The flight attendants were very serious and not much into pleasantries, but still pleasant when I needed to interact with them. The plane was a bit old, could have been slightly cleaner, but wasn't like a pigsty. The ticket was also a bit pricey considering that this was basically a 1-hour regional flight on a commuter jet (then again, I guess having to pay federal fees to the US and Canada for this flight might explain the price). Again, the experience was slightly above-average, I'd probably still choose them over American or Southwest in the US if I needed to fly to certain places outside of North America.",10th September 2021,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Vancouver,Sep-21,4,4,3,0,4,0,2,5
42,poor customer service,Michael Campbell,TripVerified," Very disappointed. I used 110,000 aeroplan miles plus $1,500 Cdn. for return premium economy Toronto - Vanouver. They switched the seats so one of us got tossed back in coach then switched the return date to the next day without explanation. I waited on hold 1.5 hours and the only suggestion was to cancel which I did. The same flight was later booked on Westjet, premium economy both ways, almost same time, seats together for $950 CDN. no airmiles needed. Air Canada too expensive, poor customer service, erratic untrustworthy booking and aeroplan points appear to actually increase, not decrease costs.

Today I reached airport almost on time and by the time I reached the gate I was 3-4 mins late. I requested the crew and told them to accommodate me in the same flight instead of understanding the situation they preferred to argue.

46,"Totally, unpleasant flight",R Kanovic,TripVerified,"  The flight 1421 Varadero-Toronto was delayed an hour. After we boarded the plane, the captain came on to say that we expect to be further delayed because of the paper problems with Cubans where supposedly they might return some of the passengers that he brought on his earlier flight form Toronto, which added almost another hour. Quite unusual, but well. During that hour of waiting aboard the plane, the crew kept reminding passengers via PA and directly to keep the masks on or face fines. Then they made an announcement saying they know we are getting hot and we are hungry and thirsty, but to be patient and once again keep masks on. The next announcement asked people sitting next to the windows to put the shades down so we would not be that hot. Each announcement was given in English, French and Spanish , so talking never stopped. Once we were up in the air, they could not get the safety demonstration video to play properly, so they told us in 3 languages again to read subtitles. The food service was then further delayed because they said there was a medical emergency. Finally, the cart with the food/drinks shows up. Yes, it is Covid, so told us the director of service, as she ""cannot pick up trash while offering food for purchase because she is not supposed to mix clean and dirty"". But the staff was supposed to use paper menu that every passenger touched, and was collected and passed to the next row.

47,no apologies were offered for the inconvenience,CT Apedjinou,NotVerified,"  With over 15 years of travel experience I can definitely say this was the worst I experience. I have not flown on Air Canada for a while and will not be doing so in the near future. This was horrible from the clerk at the baggage drop-off to the boarding hostesses - rude and complete incompetence. It first started at the Air Canada luggage drop off point. The clerk pointed out that my carry-on was too big and requested I paid 115$ for the extra bag. So, I transferred everything to a small bag I had inside and to my other bags. When she weighed everything, one bag was 21 kg and the other 25 (2 kgs over the limit). She requested I remove the extra 2 kg or pay 100 $. I managed to remove the extra weight which she accepted. To my surprise at the gate, the hostess flags my boarding pass during boarding literally calling me a thief because I failed to pay the overweight and oversize fee. I was shocked, I tried to explain that this was an error and there is no way I made it through the security without paying. The hostess flat out told me I was lying and that there was no way for them to know I was telling the truth. They made me wait until all passengers boarded then a supervisor came and confirmed that I was telling the truth and that the clerk made a mistake. I was finally allowed to board. Please note: no apologies were offered for the inconvenience. As I was walking to the airplane to board, I started to experience some cramps in my hips since I was standing for a long time. I had to stopped in the middle of the ramp and wait for the pain to stop. To add to my frustration, here come another hostess asking me to move or she will get my name off the plane! I explained that I am having a cramp and just need a couple of minutes. The lady repeated herself saying that I needed to move or else my name will be removed from the plane. When she saw I ignored her and was still holding my hip she run off to the counter saying - ""that’s it, I am removing your name from the flight"".. I was really shocked I have never had in one encounter so many unkind people. This was a night flight and I imagine everyone was exhausted but the treatment I received was beyond unimaginable. The humiliation over and over again. I am so disappointed and really hope this company starts holding their employees accountable for the way they treat their customers.",31st August 2021,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Ottawa,Aug-21,2,2,0,0,1,0,1,5
48,absolutely no service for stranded passengers,Maurice House,NotVerified,  Air Canada has no class. They cancelled my return flight and left me stranded in Morocco. They would not allow my travel agent to exchange my ticket with another airline. At the last hour flight prices on other airlines had doubled. Air Canada offered a partial refund which did not cover half the fair to get home. Big loss for me and absolutely no service for stranded passengers. The head steward on my flight was a mask Nazi. I was very aware and cooperative. But it is very awkward putting on a mask every time they pass you while eating or drinking. No common sense at all. As the walk towards you while eating you have to put a mask on.

49,Fly with anyone else,Amanda Leitch,NotVerified,"  This airline is disgusting. They canceled a flight and moved to the next day, not offering accommodation for sleeping. Ok fine. Was told the PCR covid test will be extended to the next day. The flight was from Toronto to San Diego with a layover in Vancouver. They allowed the flight to Vancouver and then was not allowed to continue to San Diego and told we were lying about the test extension. They lost the luggage, and stranded us here in Vancouver with absolutely no reconciliation. I will not be letting this go.

50,never been so disappointed,Beau Laughlin,TripVerified,"  I booked a domestic flight (In the same province) originally on July 30th for 1:20pm. I showed up at Vancouver Airport at 12:00pm. It was my mistake this day for showing up too close to the time and I had to cancel because I missed the flight. Went back home All good I booked the flight through Expedia, got a refund and my expedia account was re-issued the credits again. Booked through Expedia for another flight for the next day to the same location. Flight was scheduled for 8:05am. Ok I decided to show up 2 and a half hours before the flight just to be safe. Get to the airport at roughly 5:30am, standing in line to check in and the lineup doesn't look too long. But They only have 3 people working the computers and the line moves incredibly slow. After almost an hour and twenty minutes of waiting in line I start to panic because I have only made it a little over halfway through this lineup. I start flagging down Air Canada staff to alert them that I may miss my flight if things don't speed up. Alerted one girl and she said : ""ok sir, someone will be over to assist you."" 15 minutes goes by with no assistance and I alert another girl. She gives me the same line as the other girl. And the same exact outcome. Nobody comes to assist me. After 15 more minutes I hop over the rope to the counter and beg them to please have someone come over and help me, or I will miss my flight. Again the girl tries to re-assure me they will help me and tells me to get back in line. Well after 2+ hours in line, and not one Air Canada staff coming over to help After I had asked. I'm one person away from being helped at the front counter. And just feel defeated. I step up to the front and talk to the girl and she tells me immediately that I have missed my flight. I can't describe my frustration, I even left well before my flight just to be able to make the flight in time. Two and a half hours before my flight and I still missed it. And this was a domestic flight. I have never in my life had to give myself so much time to make a flight, let alone a hour and a half flight. And still miss the flight. Air Canada offered no compensation and also did not appear to have any sympathy for my situation. I still had to fly up that day to go up for work, so I was desperate to get on a flight. Luckily a Westjet flight to the same destination was available. I walked over to the Westjet lineup, which was the same size as the Air Canada lineup. Managed to get through the line, book my flight and check on my bag within 15 minutes. Yes, within 15 minutes I did all of that. To top it all off, I canceled my flight through Expedia. Got the credit for Air Canada flights on my expedia account. Decided to try and book another flight with my available credit, but the expedia representative told me he couldn't book it because Air Canada had suspended my ticket, and I needed to call Air Canada to open it. Try to call Air Canada and they said they aren't taking any calls at the moment. Anyways I'm stuck with a 900$ balance for Air Canada that I now can't use until they get back to me. And will probably have to book through westjet to get back home which means even more money I will have to shell out due to Air Canada.  I have never been so disappointed with a service in my life.",29th August 2021,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Prince Rupert,Jul-21,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,6
51,did put me on another flight,H Mahden,TripVerified,"  I use to travel with Air Canada for many years and never had any issues. Since the past 3 years I've encountered several problem that I am now doubting Air Canada. On my way from BC to California the entire way was pretty smooth and the pilot was friendly along with the staff. The problem was coming back from California to BC. Unfortunately my flight got delayed by 25 minutes when I landed in BC I had a connecting flight. I had to undergo the entire PCR, boarder security check. When I spoke to Air Canada I told them I have a connecting flight and with the looks of it I may not make it. I was told its okay we have time and my check-in was done so they will hold the flight for me. I got to security screening and long line up, I than again told the Air Canada person I have a connecting flight I need to go my flight will leave AT 5:20 which means boarding must've ended at 5:05 and I was at security till 5:10. I than rushed so fast to get to the gate and my flight took off! Air Canada did put me on another flight that took off at 8:45PM.  I do not understand why Air Canada couldn't just tell me from the start that they will put me on another flight and shouldn't my name be called when someone is running late or is behind?",26th August 2021,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nanaimo to Los Angeles via Vancouver,Aug-21,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,6
52,over four months to get a refund,Richard Lavallee,TripVerified,"  Still not sure why it is taking over four months to get a refund from covid tickets bought last September. Originally forced to get aeroplan points, then we could get refund via original form of payment. In April the refund site would at least tell you what date of originally purchased tickets refund they were working on. Then May 26th they stopped reporting any dates at all also basically said don’t call customer service, they can’t give you information. I have a diary of all the times I’ve reached out and never have I heard of a major company being so distant to the consumer.  Yesterday (8/24) I finally took on the 1hr hold thru customer service just trying to get information. I was told that she has talked to other people who have been waiting nine months (is this supposed to make me feel better?) she will send up my information and “they” should let me know something shortly.

53,I did file for reimbursement,B Deane,TripVerified,"  Flight in Chicago had a 4 hour delay so we were delayed, almost missed our connection Air Canada let everyone off the plane instead of just the people with the imminent connections. Being on the back of the plane, things didn't look good Following that the agents barely listened to our questions on how to get to connections in time; instead directed us to customs and immigration. After 30 minutes in line, got to the customs agent, he says, ""why are you here? I'll walk you to connections."" Of course we missed the plane. Then the air Canada customer support agent in Toronto was useless. He let it slip that just the 4 of us missed our flight. And that it was our problem. We couldn't leave the airport and gave us one hotel room for 4 people. Went to CBP and again, they say ""why weren't you escorted""? We weren't supposed to walk where the Air Canada agents sent us alone.  I did file for reimbursement, but judging by the job Air Canada's done so far, that won't happen. They proceeded to lose our luggage and return it to us on our 9th and last day of our trip. Followed by not letting part of our party board because our recovery letter didn't said ""recovered from covid"" xx date signed by a doctor but missed the words ""for travel.""

54,total lack of guidance,R Morris,NotVerified,"  Will try to never fly with Air Canada again after our experience.  Minutes before we were to board the final leg of a return flight from Rome, Italy - the Toronto to IAD Washington leg - AC7708, that flight was cancelled by Air Canada. All the passengers on what we were told was a full flight were directed to the AC customer services desk elsewhere in the airport. When we arrived there we learned another AC flight to Pittsburgh had also been cancelled. The Washington bound group joined at the back of this line of what was probably 300+ people. Over the next three+ hours no announcements to all the people in line were offered by AC customer service staff. At various times when Canadian citizen passengers, who were given vouchers on the spot and escorted past us out of the terminal by AC customer service staff, different AC staff gave incomplete and varying information in response to questions from non-Canadian citizen passengers. We were told we could not leave that area of the terminal due to Covid restrictions. We were told it would be days for us to find flights to final destinations - especially if there were multiple passengers on one booking etc. The total lack of guidance by AC staff to passengers led many to search for options. Also the customer service line was not moving as they were short staffed and having major computer rebooking issues. With 10pm approaching, no movement in the rebooking line, horror stories from other US passengers closer to the AC desk hearing rebooked flights for Thursday soonest etc., we felt we had to act. We began hearing also that Airport Security would not let us remain in the airport overnight. We secured a one-way car rental and drove 9 hours back to DC. At no time was a hotel stay offered by Air Canada or any talk of a voucher due to the cancellation. It was a total failure by them to communicate guidance for a situation that they - not the weather or other forces beyond their control - had caused. We are being told now by the Air Canada website that it will be 60 days for a reply to refund request due to a flight cancellation.

The plane we supposed to board got delayed for two and half hours at Los Angeles airport, we received food voucher there by an Air Canada agent. After landing at Toronto we got stuck on the plane for another one hour because of the traffic. Because of the covid situation we had to do our immigration and baggage claim in the Toronto airport. We were told by the Air Canada we will get hotel vouchers as we missed our connected flight because of the delay. We were directed to aisle number 7 and 8 of Air Canada for the hotels voucher. After waiting for about 3 hours in the queue when we got a chance to see the rep at the counter we were told that we are not eligible for the hotel voucher. And the representative didn’t want to help us and constantly misbehaving with us.  Later the manager explained it was not the airlines fault as we got delayed by the customs at Los Angeles airport. But we didn’t do our custom at Los Angeles. And he also added we will not get hotel voucher and will not get any compensation.  Such a bad customer service.

56,Air Canada has not compensated me,A Malson,TripVerified,"  I booked my flight from Toronto to Kamloops via Vancouver using reward points in June 2021. I booked my seat at the time of booking the flight - choosing 2A. A couple of days later I received a notification that my seat had been changed to 3A - not a big deal. On the 14th of August, I checked in online for my flight. A minute or two after checking in I received a notification that my seat was being changed to 28D - economy class, and minute or so after that another notification that my seat was changed again to 19D (may have been premium economy). I went into my bookings on the Air Canada website and my seat still showed as 3A. Next morning just to be sure I phoned Air Canada and after 1 hour 22 minutes, the agent confirmed I was in 3A from what she could see. I went to the airport and checked in at the counter and the agent printed me a boarding card for 19D. Told him this was not acceptable and explained what had taken place the day before. He then found an open seat in business class - seat 1D and gave me a new boarding card with my baggage tag attached. While going through security my phone alerted me to a message indicated my seat had changed and I was now in 27J (economy), and a few minutes later a new seat change to 21D, and then another change to 12D (Premium economy). Asked the agents in the lounge and they said I should go to the gate and check as it is a involuntary downgrade. The agent at the gate had my new boarding card for 12D. He said however I should wait until the entire plane boarded in case someone was a no show in business class. I ended up in 12D. There was absolutely no explanation as to why any of this happened, and how a person who has paid for business class (even if it was with points) can have their seat changed after they have checked in for the flight. It is now five days later and Air Canada has not compensated me. On top of this my connecting flight to Kamloops was cancelled due to weather and when I went to collect my bag and could not find it I realized that the agent did not transfer my baggage tag on my original boarding card to the new one printed. My take on this is that someone who was paying cash/credit for business class was given my seat as I was deemed dispensable because I purchased mine with my Aeroplan points. To not be offered an explanation or compensation is disgusting. Especially as I have been a loyal Air Canada client for many years and have flown business many, many times.",20th August 2021,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Toronto to Vancouver ,Aug-21,1,3,2,4,2,0,1,6
57,saying that I am late for check in,Nishita Jodhani ,TripVerified,"  I booked my flight from Toronto to Winnipeg for August 16, 2021. I reached at check in line at about 19.15 and i told one of the lady employee standing there that i have a flight at 20.30 and she told me to wait in line that you still have a time. When i reached to the counter it was about 19.50 and the lady denied me to board the flight saying that I am late for check in.  Even when i asked what i can do now as i know nobody in Toronto she said she cant do anything in it and she just gave me option that i have to get another ticket from her different day flight.

For some bizarre reason they forgot to pack our luggage on our flight. After waiting 1 hour for them to tell us this, we were told to go to our hotel and the luggage would be there within 2 hours. It is now Midnight (10 hours later ) and they never brought the luggage. They also haven't answered the customer service line after we waiting 1 hour 24 minutes before hanging up.

59,third time delaying our flight,Mihailo Karamarkovic,NotVerified,  My flight was delayed then they let us board the plane. After one hour in the plane they told us to leave plane until they fix a tire. After 90 minutes they told us that the flight is canceled until tomorrow at 15:00. We came early and spent two hours checking again. They are for the third time delaying our flight. I lost a hope that we would be leaving today. I lost important meetings today. My wife and I lost work days. For all of this ordeal we were compensated with $10 food voucher.

60,flight kept getting pushed back,S Marbira,TripVerified,"  vOur flight was supposed to take off at 6:30, at 6:50 there was not a flight attendant or any announcement about delays. Passengers tried asking Air Canada attendants from nearby gates as to why no one had come to even say anything. Only to be told they have no idea, can't call anyone, or provide any information. The flight was shown as on time well past departure time. We were told to trek to a service desk across the airport to ask. Eventually the time of the flight kept getting pushed back and back, with no announcements or even a person coming to explain what happened. We missed our next layover because of it.",15th August 2021,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Boston,Aug-21,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,7
61,not resolving problems professionally,Jason Gilroy,TripVerified,"  They couldn’t have screwed things up any worse than they already have. Took me 12h to fly 1,000km, with one connecting flight. it would have been faster, easier, and cheaper to drive. I couldn’t afford any screw-ups so I booked the day’s earliest flight, 3 weeks in advance. I showed up 2h early. My flight was delayed 1h, not a huge deal, I should still make my connecting flight. Only to learn upon landing in Toronto that my flight was cancelled in less than 2h from departure time - my cancelled flight was re-booked for the day’s last flight - there were many earlier flights available, which customer service would not give me because they would have to locate my bag. This turned a 1h layover into a 9h layover, and I was already stranded in another city at this point, I couldn’t very well cancel my ticket. 33 people in line, ONE customer service representative. Took me 1.5h to move my way to the front of the cue. I was quickly dismissed, told there was nothing they could do because they couldn’t be bothered with locating the bag and he was on to the next person. This person was not resolving problems professionally. ",10th August 2021,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Quebec City,Aug-21,2,2,0,0,1,0,1,7

64,business class had one cold dinner option,S Karziel,TripVerified,"  The Signature Class check-in experience in Toronto was pathetic. There were only 4 us in the designated Signature Class check in hall but it still took almost 30 min. The agents seem confused. The lounge is a bare bones version of the domestic lounge (not Signature Class). So if you are flying from the gates you have to leave the lounge way in advance of your flight. An overnight, trans-Atlantic flight in business class had one cold dinner option consisting of a pea falafel. The mid flight snack was a basket of kit kats and nuts. Very limited drinks service. I woke up early and asked for breakfast. The flight attendant said I can't give it to you now because others will see and ask for it. Breakfast was even more pathetic: the menu said it was a croissant but it came in a plastic wrap with some fruit, etc. Given the state of breakfast, she could have easily served it to me when requested. I've flown other airlines as part of this trip and somehow they were able to serve hot meals with multiple choices in business and economy; and have functioning lounges.

It never showed up.  I waited 48 hours to have it returned. At no point did anybody tell me anything; they just left me hanging while they fiddled with my bag.

66,experience this week was awful,P Hewett,TripVerified,"  I've flown with Air Canada more than any other airline in the past 5 years, and I've always ignored small unpleasant comments from ground and flight staff as well as poor organization and flight problems because flying Air Canada was often the only option available (or at least slightly more affordable) and I accepted it as a means to an end. However, my experience this week was awful. It started with a 3.5 to 4-hour line  to the check-in counter. We were told that self check-in isn't available so everyone had to wait in a single line. Most people ended up missing their flights. The airline only had four counters available and would not offer any communication to anyone who was worried about their flight.  At one point many of us reaching the front of the line were asked to break off and form a new line off to the side to make more space. After about 45 minutes of waiting, a new staff member asked us why we were standing there and told us our line doesn't lead anywhere. She told us we have to go back to the end of the line we were previously in if we wanted to be served. When other passengers became frustrated and mentioned that we have been waiting the longest and were asked to stand there, the ground staff responded that it wasn't true and that there was no way we've been waiting for 3 hours so far. Some people reacted by yelling while others started to cry from frustration. Once I finally made it to the check-in counter, I was told that all the other flights to Boston that day were full so my only option was to be placed on stand-by for all the flights in hopes that one of them would have extra space. I was told to wait at each gate one hour before a flight departs to see if my name was called. Luckily, I was able to board a flight that day and made it to Boston in the evening. When I arrived, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I went to the luggage service desk to inquire about it and was told that my luggage was not put on my flight because there was too much weight on the flight and it was better to take all the passengers to their destination than load all the luggage. If I knew this would have been the case, I would have much preferred to not board my flight and keep my personal items than arrive in a different country without my belongings. I was told the luggage would arrive on another flight and could be delivered to the place I was staying on the next day. I left all my contact information and had to hope for the best. The next day, I checked the online status of my luggage and it said that it had been loaded onto a delivery truck at 2pm. I waited and waited for it to arrive, but nothing came. I called Air Canada and they told me that the luggage will arrive anytime before 11:30pm. I didn't want to miss the delivery so I spent the first day of my trip just waiting. By midnight, no one had arrived. It is now the next day and I'm still waiting. Air Canada is unable to reach the delivery company.",5th August 2021,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Boston,Aug-21,2,2,1,0,1,0,1,7
67,update their policies regarding transit visas,Thea Gatchalian,TripVerified,"  Supposed to be my original flight was July 31st YWG to YVR then YVR to NRT via Air Canada and layover of 24h 20m HND to MNL via Philippine Airlines. My flight schedule was changed several times by another booking agency. The time I was about to check-in in Winnipeg, Air Canada didn’t give me my boarding pass and didn’t allow me to board my plane because according to them, my layover in Japan should only be less than 24 hours in order for me not to avail a transit visa. I researched a couple of times before my flight and I found out that a passenger is allowed to transit to Japan without a visa up to 72 hours with a confirmed ticket and if there are no available flights on the said date of arrival. Air Canada told me to call my booking agency and to adjust my layover time. But there are no longer available flights possible for that day. I was forced to book a new plane ticket amounting to $2937.46 including taxes on an economy ticket for the next day.  Air Canada was so useless and I felt so disappointed because I have to travel back home again for an hour travel time and my brother who fetched me to the airport was already gone back home.  I found the airline very inconsiderate and I hope they will update their policies regarding transit visas.

70,Covid test I had taken was unacceptable,L Cotterell,NotVerified,"  I recently made reservations for a flight from Toronto to Newark on June 30th. My original reservation was for 230pm and arriving in Newark at 401pm. My flight was cancelled while sitting on the plane waiting for it to takeoff. The reason for the cancellation was ""a tornado warning."" Meanwhile in Newark it was 98 degrees and sunny. Everyone from that flight was made to stand on a long line while waiting on ONE customer service representative to attend to the 100 plus people from my flight and trying to assist an additional 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations. Needless to say the 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations were attended to while myself and the passengers that had been deplaned were told after an hour to come back tomorrow because our flight had been postponed to 8am the following day (July 1st). We had made reservations to drive from Newark to Ocean City MD for a two night stay but due to Air Canada we did not make it and we were only able to enjoy half a day and a one night stay and due to it being the Fourth of July no extensions were being offered. So we basically payed $400 for a room and extra for a flight with no compensations.  On July 6th at 8am I boarded a United flight from Philadelphia to Washington with and hour and half stop over in Washington where I was boarding an Air Canada flight at 1030am to Toronto. When I went to check in for my flight to Toronto I was told that the Covid test that I had taken was unacceptable and I was required to have a PCR test in order to board any flight to Canada. So I missed the 1030am flight, and went downstairs to get a rapid PCR test done. $250 USD later I received a negative PCR test and made my way back to the Air Canada counter to see if I was able to get on a later flight.  When I approached the Air Canada counter the gentleman rudely tried to give me a card with Air Canada's Customer service number (that I have been trying to call for days to find out information regarding Covid testing) I told him ""please don't try to give me that number you know  that no one answers that phone."" He went to the back to supposedly speak to someone and then quickly came back to me and stated ""We have another flight at 430pm but we are fully booked so we cannot help you. Anyways you should try United because it is their fault for allowing you on that flight this morning with the wrong test."" Long story short, I went over to the United counter and the gentleman who I believe was the supervisor,  stated to me that he would ""try his best to put me on a flight to Toronto."" He got me on the United flight from Washington to Toronto at 545pm, which I am grateful for.",8th July 2021,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Philadelphia,Jul-21,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,8

72,agents did not pay attention to detail,H Barten,TripVerified,"  I flew business class on Air Canada from Newark to Doha via Toronto. I was connecting to my favorite airline, Qatar. I was looking forward to the service. However, AC was terrible. Check in at EWR was hectic. The agents did not pay attention to detail and gave me boarding passes belonging to someone else. Not a huge deal.  My flight arrived to Toronto late and I arrived at the gate just as they were calling for final boarding. I went to the agent and gave her all of the documentation she asked for without comment as I was catching my breath. At the end of it all, she said, ""you could be nicer you know"" I asked what her problem was and that I had given her everything that she asked for and that she was not particularly nice either.  The flight was terrible for business class. They had one menu with no options. The dinner was good, but breakfast was inedible. The seat was very comfortable and the flight attendants friendly. However, Air Canada has taken cost cutting in business class to a low. I connect to Qatar on a five hour flight. They had numerous menu options and better good. It is interesting how North Americans want to complain about the Middle Eastern carriers and their subsidies. However, the North American carriers get subsidies as well. Where they can't compete is service. If I am spending over $3000 on a business class ticket, and my choices are Air Canada or a Middle Eastern carrier, I would be a fool to spend my money on Air Canada.

On-line booking and seat selection was normal although when the booking was made (just after lunch), there was only one flight for the remainder of the day. Booked a seat in Economy class and upgraded to Business Class on check-in at the airport. Security was moderately busy but once again, CATSA screening staff at Ottawa Airport were disinterested and not helpful (showed my boarding pass and was motioned to join the long economy queue, asked if that was the business line and then was motioned to join mid-way rather than being directed to the priority queue). After security, walked to the gate (Maple Leaf lounge at Ottawa is currently closed) and boarding was just commencing. Boarded quickly onto the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft and found my upgraded seat (4A) without issue. Flight departed on schedule. In-flight service consisted of a box lunch/snack along with a small water bottle, bag of pretzels, ear buds, promotional flyer about cleanliness protocols and sanitizing wipes.

I paid a lot of money for this upgrade and Air Canada refuses to refund my money.

The reviews of the Customer Support Team are incredibly low, and unfortunately, I have to agree with them. The support members are rude with an attitude, and the entire experience with the airline has been putrid from start to finish. Due to multiple flight cancellations, it has taken Air Canada over 3 months to process flight refunds (which are still not received) despite being offered the refund ticket months ago. And with the support team, there are a myriad of excuses as to why the funds have not been processed. No one on the support team is capable of assisting, response time is despicable, and even the booking process is a mess.

81,The main problem crops up with the IFE in the old cabin,Aaditya Suratkar,TripVerified," From a service perspective, Air Canada is great, both on ground, on telephone and in the air. Their staff are polite, professional, practical and very accommodating. The pilots are well trained and provide sufficient information to the passengers along the route. The aircrafts are properly maintained and cabins are sufficiently clean. The main problem crops up with the IFE in the old cabin. I have flown Air Canada domestic, transcontinental and international multiple times to be able to say that the IFEs on their old and new cabins are chalk and cheese. On the most recent flight(s), I flew on the old cabin(s). The IFEs in the old cabins are slow, unresponsive and have a rather strange choice of music and programs. The headphones don't always work in old cabins either, but given that the most interesting thing on the old IFE could be the flight map, you might not need them at all. The IFEs in new cabins, however, are far better. It's overall a good and safe full-service airline with a good network and value for money.

82,this airline is absolutely shameful,A Lewis,TripVerified," We returned from St-Lucia yesterday night, December 19th. It’s been 3 years now since we have flown with Air Canada. Due to our last few very bad experiences, we tried to avoid them at all costs. This time, we had no other choice than Air Canada to fly to Saint-Lucia. Three days before our return to Ottawa via Toronto, we notice on the AC application that our return flight will be delayed 2 hours, thus missing our connection in Toronto for Ottawa. They changed our flight to another time that was still impossible to catch. Arriving in Toronto late on Saturday night, the Air Canada employee was immediately firm about telling us they are not providing a hotel and meal voucher as they pretend it is ""out of their control"", they seem to have all the freedom to lie about what’s in or out of their control. To be honest we saw it coming, having experienced their completely non-existent customer relations in the past and after talking with some of their former employees (management level), it was our fear that we would face their abuse once more. Any other airline in the world would have treated this issue fairly (from experience). I am sure all Canadians would love to feel pride in our main airline and feel appreciated and be respected by a company that carries our flag around the globe. In reality, this airline is absolutely shameful, it abuses its customers every single day, and by the looks of it none of their employees are proud to represent this company either. As a Canadian that travelled around the world, the lack of service, appreciation and fairness from Air Canada is very obvious when comparing to any other airline.

We made a final plea with Air Canada to please cancel the travel voucher they sent to Flight Network and send directly to us. Air Canada came through. The customer service agent was very understanding and really came through for us. No more booking through Flight Network. We will book directly through Air Canada now. It really comes down to how Air Canada treated us. And although they've sometimes received bad reviews in the past, we really think they're turning a corner.

They are in the practice of refusing to refund the purchase price even after they choose to cancel the flight. In these Covid days flights are frequently cancelled through lack of passenger capacity. Air Canada would have been aware of this before they posted the flight. They claim that this practice is consistent with other airlines policies. This is totally untrue. They also claim that the cancellation is due to uncontrollable circumstances. This is also totally untrue. Air Canada chose to cancel the flight.

They then emailed us and told us they completely cancelled the flight. We tried calling them multiple times to address this and kept getting a busy tone. Due to time constraints and not missing our honeymoon, we booked through another airline. We finally got a hold of customer support and they said that they can’t refund us because it was a “schedule change”. They cancelled the whole flight!

91,told the money is coming,F Kayla,TripVerified,"  Had booked a flight for mid April to fly to Ecuador. The flight was from Vancouver to Toronto, Toronto to Quito. COVID happened so they cancelled our flight from Toronto to Quito and back, There was no refund. We cancelled the new flight (we didn't want to go to Toronto for two weeks) and never got our money back. We took a $500 hit for cancelling but were still owed $900- we have a receipt saying this money would be sent to us. This was at the end of March. It is now the end of September. I have multiple times spent the 2+ hours on hold with them only to be told ""the money is coming"" and being given random numbers like ""in 51 business days"" or some other such nonsense. I get COVID happened and airlines had a whole bunch of people to reroute and refund and deal with but it has been 6 months.

He would simply slip it back on whenever the stewardess was looking. Eventually he fell asleep and I managed to point out that he was not properly wearing it (or even remaining in his own seat) and the stewardess said “he’s sleeping so..” then shrugged and walked away. So I got to spend my flight with a mask-less man invading my space and taking a full open mouth nap. Just know if you fly with Air Canada, your safety is not their number one priority. In my case, the safety of myself and other people on my flight was less important than one mans nap.",22nd September 2020,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edmonton to Toronto,Sep-20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,10

95,it was cancelled again,C Harshel,TripVerified,"  I booked my flight out of China after COVID-19 hit. China had already officially announced to the public a one-flight-a-week per country per airline policy, but when Air Canada continued listing daily flights out, I believed that Canada must have been an exception. I called to ask questions, but apparently I didn't ask the right ones. My flight was cancelled, then I rebooked, then it was cancelled again. Air Canada wasn't able to fly even once weekly until mid August, after many other airlines had resumed doing so. I eventually had to book a flight out on a Chinese airline, and had to frantically rehome my kitty as a result of Air Canada's false promises. The company is refusing to issue me refunds even for these flights that they never could have expected to take off. I used to feel confident about flying Air Canada.

Delays after delays without compensation, and whenever I go to the kiosk to ask them to put me on a different connecting flight, they are always reluctant and would tell me to contact Ctrip directly (where I originally booked my ticket).  Once I specifically asked about my tagged bags when they put me on a different flight, and after they explained to me that bags are attached to the barcode of my new boarding pass and that I have nothing to worry about, I went home without my bags for two days. My entertainment system also didn't work for three hours. ",8th August 2020,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Edmonton via Vancouver,Dec-19,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,10

Even when you can hear someone they can't provide any additional information other than what's online, which in my case was always incorrect. No way to contact actually baggage counters. The Air Canada rep told me it would be faster for me to drive 40min each way to the airport vs try to use the 1-800 number. The flight itself was delayed l, and in a 5hour flight we were given  water and pretzels.

98,credit of $350 only good for $43 dollars,M Barson,TripVerified,"  Air Canada changed the flight itinerary for a Toronto-Seattle flight, and I could no longer make the flight due to this change. They offered to convert the value of my flight ($350) into a credit that I could use at a later date. I thought this was great, and proceeded to apply the credit to a different flight (Toronto-Dublin) which costs $590 on the AirCanada website, taxes included (Image attached). I would've expected that my $350 credit would be applied to the new $590 flight, and I'd just have to pay the remaining balance of $240. This is not what happened. The credit of $350 was only good for $43 dollars on this new flight, and the rest of the credit vanished ($307), and I'm now at a net expense of $853 because I was charged an additional $546 ""tax charge"" for the new Dublin flight booking (on top of the remaining $307 credit value that couldn't be applied and doesn't exist anymore). I was not informed that it would have been better to use my credit for the same Toronto-Seattle route, instead of applying the credit to a new destination where the taxes aren't transferable. So after realizing this on my own, I then tried to cancel that new booking to Dublin and receive a refund for the $546, as it was still within 24 hours of the booking confirmation. This way I could keep my original $350 credit to save for a later date to use for Seattle specifically, and get full use of the credit value, and just book the Dublin flight separately on my own. However, they said this was also not possible, as a new booking made with a credit isn't the same as a regular booking, so the 24 hour rule doesn't apply, and I'm left short $307 in credit value that doesn't exist. I've contacted their customer relations department, and they've responded saying they cannot assist me.  I've had multiple trip cancellations with other airlines, where my credits were kept and applied for the full value of the ticket. I don't understand how $350 dollars in credit only becomes $43 in usable valuable, while the rest goes down the drain. Don't advertise increased flexibility with credits and vouchers, when in fact they are imaginary and will leave you short hundreds of dollars. I hope this helps with other people who aren't sure what to do about a flight credit/ voucher with Air Canada.

While attempting to book a flight home there were some issues and I ended up being billed for a ticket I did not need. After some back and forth and confusion I spoke with a woman named Betty from the Montreal office. She was extremely helpful, and very patient with me as this was a somewhat confusing issue. Adding the stress of this extra charge on top of my family emergency was obviously upsetting. She placed me on hold and when she returned had informed me everything was taken care of and I would be getting a refund.

101,turning me into a customer for life,Olivia Jain,NotVerified,"  I Booked a Ticket Through +1 855-948-3661 , I recently had a horrible experience with my luggage on a Air Canada flight but it was corrected right immediately. After coming home from a work trip, the weather wasn't great and I was in a hurry to get home to my fur baby. I got my luggage and it was soaked and I assumed it was from the rain ... but I was wrong. I smelled something a little funny but didn't think much of it since there was a lot of people around. I threw my luggage in my car and while driving I started getting bursts of fishy odor. I got home and opened my trunk and almost fell over by the scent of fish. I took my luggage out and opened it and everything inside was covered in a gray liquid. My stuff was ruined. I came right back to the airport and Sherry and Luis helped me out. It was really embarrassing walking through the airport smelling like fish but they were so kind. The scent was so strong we had to cover our noses and hold our breath as we went through what items needed to be reimbursed. Luis took me to get a new suitcase since mine needed to be thrown away and Sherry gave me a nice Air Canada duffel bag to help transfer over some shoes and purses I wanted to try and clean. While it was a big inconvenience after a long and tiring day, I was happy with the outcome of the situation.

102,my flights kept on changing,S Meade,TripVerified,"  I booked a flight 5 months in advance, from the booking date to two weeks before departure my flights kept on changing until i had 8 flights overlapping. There was no contact from Air Canada about the flight changes, I thought it was a technical issue with the app but when the problem was not resolved I contacted customer service and was told I would have to stay over night at my own expense at connecting airports on both directions. So my flight I paid extra for, to be as short as possible, was originally 6 hours there and back became 28 and 22 hours with no other option. It took 3 days of contacting customer support to get a reasonable flight rebooked. They wanted an extra 1200$ per ticket to change which would be triple of my original ticket and would take more than double the travel time. At multiple airports the counter staff tried moving me and my wife to opposite sides of the plane and called me selfish for not agreeing to their terms. Saying ""you are so me me me"" on top of the poor customer service the policy for free seat selection during 24 hour checkin changed and I had to pay an extra 98$ to sit next to my wife again! The Only positive experience was the plane it was quite nice and on board crew were very polite.

I asked her to send me an email saying the flight was cancelled instead she sent me an email giving me credits back.   The funny part is a ticket from Boston to Lebanon cost is like 1/10 of the cost and the rest is tax. So technically you get only credits for the ticket and the tax is dependent.

This is despite Air Canada changing our flights which was booked for 23rd June 2020 to an evening flight making it more than 3hrs different from our original 1.30pm flight. Air Canada and their policy states that a refund is entitled if delays are longer than 3hrs. Expect lots of cut and paste responses from their website along with them considering the matter closed despite repeated requests to consider current hardship circumstances. ,26th May 2020,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Toronto,May-20,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,11

The lady at the counter after sometime on the computer said so your flight got cancelled a month ago and email was sent to all the passengers and told me to contact my travel agent in Vancouver.

I went back to the same lady on the counter and said our bags are already checked in she told us to go to terminal 5 to talk to the Air Canada agents to get our bags. On the way to terminal 5 I started thinking, I did not book my tickets a month ago and I did not receive any emails from air Canada. At terminal 5 the agent said we have to go back to terminal 6 they would be responsible for our luggage.

109,I missed the boarding call,Doug Greenall,TripVerified,"  In December 2019 Air Canada cancelled my return ticket home while I was in Colombia. The return ticket included one domestic leg (Cartagena to Bogota) then two more legs, first to Toronto and then Vancouver. I missed the boarding call for the third leg of my incoming ticket so Air Canada, without even contacting me, cancelled all three of my flights home. After I missed my final short flight from Bogota to Medellin, I purchased another ticket from Latam Airlines, the local carrier for my last flight.  I spent six days using international minutes trying to reach Air Canada from Medellin. I tried everything under the sun to get a human voice on the line. Finally a friend of mine in Canada reached them, and after two and a half hours, got my flights home (the ones I’d already paid for) reinstated for $150. The money is the least of my concerns. The fact that Air Canada was unreachable is unprofessional.  Air Canada also left my luggage in Toronto and took their sweet time getting it to me.

I then told him that I am taping his silence, waste of time and horrible treatment of other people. He screamed so loudly how dare I to tape him. Called me names and hung up. It is perfectly legal in Canada for me to tape a call. It is also helpful because when I called back Air Canada they said they will not give me even the name of who I spoke to. I paid money for service. It wasn't delivered. Why should they get to keep my money during this time. A big company keeps money of people who need it now more than ever. What a horrible company.

123,they were still able to put a somewhat decent service together,A Wong,TripVerified," Vancouver to Hong Kong. First things first, I flew business class after Covid-19 measures were implemented, so I came in expecting reduced cabin service, and that was what I got. That being said, even with all the precautionary measures, I was surprised that they were still able to put a somewhat decent service together. Air Canada uses the B/E Aerospace (Now Collins Aerospace) Super Diamond seats, which arrange passengers in a reverse herringbone configuration. It's a pretty standard product, though I must say I really like the colour scheme that Air Canada uses. It just looks really clean and the colours contrast nicely. Due COVID-19, I requested the upgrade to business as a precautionary measure, and I wasn't disappointed. Even with reduced cabin services, it was still a nice experience. Sure, there's no pillow or bar service- they've warned about this on their website, but as it turned out, when they said they would be serving pre-packaged meals, all they meant was that they weren't going to plate your meal for you. It was still business quality (veal from Hawksworth), but they simply didn't give you that picture perfect plating that is so greatly appreciated. Despite the lack of a pillow, the seats were still quite comfortable, though it could still do with more lumbar support, and the lack of a pillow made the sleeping position a tad awkward because my head was dipped backwards even with the power adjustable headrest. Service could admittedly be a bit more polished, though to be fair, part of this definitely has to do with the COVID-19 precautions. I should probably try upgrading again when this blows over. I do appreciate how quiet the cabin was, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the food quality was not compromised as a result of their infection control measures.",29th March 2020,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Vancouver to Hong Kong,Mar-20,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,13
124,Air Canada were pretty good,Peter Bannister,NotVerified,"  We flew out Heathrow - Calgary return, Calgary - Kelowna and Castlegar - Calgary. Air Canada were pretty good (apart from dealing with my wife's lactose intolerence Business Class).

Due to what is happening in the world at the moment (COVID 19), Air Canada cancels the flight and refuses to give a full refund.

We boarded the flight to be told the service was to be limited due to the outbreak. No drinks were offered and when dinner was served and a drink offered the choices were boxed apple or orange juice or water. I asked for a glass of wine  to be told that hadn’t I heard the announcement. Next I asked for a tea or coffee same response no because of the corona virus I inquired what the virus had to do with this and was not answered. There was no choice of meal and the food served to me was disgusting.

We want you to know that we really do appreciate doing this. Please don’t get knocked down by all the negative comments, no one knew this would happen and we are in this together.

The Govt. of Canada issues a travel advisory at the mist of the Coronavirus and asking people to get back to Canada asap. On Air Canada website they are so humane, offering a one-time flight rescheduling at no extra cost. Nice, I would say until I call, to find out that on an $850 already paid ticket they want an extra $389! By going home earlier! Last year they also wanted to charge for a rescheduled ticket originally $960 an extra $650! By cancelling and buying a new ticket actually was cheaper!

134,level of service remains very good,John Peters,TripVerified,"  Flew from Vancouver to Hong Kong and back with AC in business class. AC's level of service on international flights remains very good. Both flights left on time. Seats are of the pod style and convert into beds which allows for comfortable sleeping on this long flight. Food is excellent. Good selection of beverages. IFE offer broad selection of Hollywood and international films and HBO television. A couple of suggestions for improvement. While the attention from the flight attendants was good, they didn't offer to assist with making up the bed as the staff on many airlines do. for example, Turkish and most Asian carriers. Second, on the return flight no announcement was made with respect to claiming luggage in Vancouver if one is travelling on The requirements vary - on flights from Europe or Narita, the baggage is sent on to one's final destination, whereas on flights from HKG one has to collect the luggage. I spoke to the senior flight attendant about this and he showed me the manual they had on-board which advises them as to the protocol, but still no announcement was made.

137,cancellation was beyond their control,E Charden,TripVerified,"  Washington to Quebec City via Montreal. We boarded the flight, but while we were awaiting takeoff we had to evacuate the plane due to a mechanical issue. After waiting a couple of hours for counter assistance, we were rebooked for another flight. We were advised that we could not continue on to Quebec that night, but would be rebooked for a flight the next day. Unfortunately, the flight was also delayed again and we arrived quite late When we arrived in Montreal the counter agents deliberated over whether we qualified for lodging as we had been promised, and we received a lecture on Air Canada’s cancelation policies. We were eventually provided hotel and meal vouchers, given directions to the shuttle, and confirmed our reservations for the flight for the next day. Our flight was cancelled the next morning due to weather, and we received an email notification that we were rescheduled for a flight two days later. We called Customer Service to see if we could get an earlier flight; the representative informed us we were scheduled for the earliest flight he could get us on to Quebec City. Since we would not have had any time 8n Quebec we decided to cancel our vacation and requested return flights Our return flight was delayed due to “Crew Availability Issues”. This delay would cause us to miss connecting flight in Ottawa. We immediately contacted the Air Canada agent at the boarding desk, who rescheduled us onto a direct flight to our home. Our Air Canada experience can be summarized as such: two flight cancellations, one for mechanical issues and one weather related; three delays, causing us to miss connections; cancellation of our Quebec Winter Carnival vacation plans; computer issues, and a stressful experience for my wife and me I think you can agree our experience with Air Canada was not universally positive. I think it is important to emphasize that if our original flight had not been cancelled for mechanical issues we would have arrived in Québec City before the snowstorm and enjoyed our vacation. We filed a claim with Air Canada for our (first) cancelled flight based on your policy of recompense for cancelled and delayed flights. Their official response was to claim the flight cancellation was beyond their control, but offered us a 15% discount on our next Air Canada flight. We have requested reimbursement for the Montreal to Quebec and return leg of our trip that we could not take. Their official response was to claim the flight cancellation was beyond their control, but offered us a 25% discount on our next Air Canada flight.

139,no winter clothes and baggage,M Smith,TripVerified,"  Before we left for our trip at the beginning of February flights were cancelled due to avoiding China, which is understandable but we were unable to call anyone from Air Canada due to their higher than normal call volume and were unable to put-on hold, just completely hung up on. We lost all of our selected seating that we had picked and ended up with not the seats we had selected. My food was garbage. On the way home our last of 3 flights was cancelled and we were stranded in Toronto for two days. We were unable to speak to anyone regarding our baggage and how to re book flights. I have a hard time believing this as we are in Canada and there are storms all the time. The was completely unacceptable. Returning to the airport the next morning to hopefully retrieve our baggage we found out that our bags had been forwarded to Winnipeg. So we have no winter clothes and baggage for the remainder of the 2 days in Toronto in February. Still one week later and you are unable to contact anyone from Air Canada by phone with not even being able to be on hold.  They redirect you to their website which also gives you the run around.

On the reassurance of a customer service agent from Air Canada that seats might be available for an earlier flight to Toronto Pearson, I stood in line for 1.5 hours trying to get on an plane back home. I was put on standby for a 5 PM flight at 4:30 PM and asked to run to the gate. I obviously was not put into that flight. Then they put me on standby for a 6 PM flight at 5:15.

144,we were relatively surprised,A Fitzpatrick,NotVerified,"  I have to say that we were relatively surprised on a recent return trip from Sydney to Vancouver and back. The departures were within 10 minutes of planned take-off times, and arrivals were either on-time or early. Check-in at both airports was very straight-forward and special thanks to the lovely ground staff lady at Vancouver who helped with our self check-in / bag drop at the airport. The crew did their job but lack the polish and personal attention to detail that you receive with the likes of Emirates and Qatar (which is one of the reasons why they are among the worlds best airlines, and Air Canada isn't). We flew Premium Economy and I'm glad we did as I felt sorry for any passengers flying in economy in a full plane on the return flight. The food service in PE was poor with rubbery, burnt omelette, rock hard bread rolls and tasteless chicken on the return route - not helped by being offered only one small glass of wine. While the entertainment system was very good and extremely easy to navigate, the earphones offered in PE were next to useless. The provision of toilets on the aircraft was rather disproportionate with 5 lavatories for 260 economy / premium economy passengers against 3 for 40 business passengers. We chose these flights because we booked 7 months in advance and got a very good deal plus the flights were direct.",25th February 2020,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Vancouver to Sydney,Feb-20,3,3,1,5,5,0,3,15

My flight coming back on the 13th Feb 2020 was horrific due to me becoming ill whilst in the air. The flight attendant that took care of me was Isabelle and she is a credit to your airline.

We were warmly greeted and directed to our seats. The biz class seats are much nicer from when we last flew them 6 years ago. There is more room and more storage space and a mattress pad as well. We both managed too get comfortable sleep at the beginning of this 14.5 hr. flight. The food was very good and plentiful. I slept through breakfast so th FA'S whipped up a snack of cheeses, chicken Tikka and a nice Cognac to go with it. Our lunch was amazing. I had lamb chops, salad, and mashed with a nice chilled Molson and then there was desert, a fluffy butterscotch torte, cheeses and ice cream, and a Couvasier Cognac to follo and Lavazza coffee. The IFE system was very easy to use and had a lot of options for movies, TV, music, etc. too many to list and the hand held device was easy to use. The flight crew were very polite and attentive too and I had a chance to speak with them during a slow moment they had and they were so nice.

152,made us wait almost 4 hours,Francis Tourigny,TripVerified,"  My last experience was a flight from Toronto to Mumbai. They made us wait almost 4 hours in the plane before taking off. They gave us mini oatmeal bars to help us wait, and half glass of water. They blame external circumstances (last time was: not enough employees to defrost the plane). Even for very simple flights like Montreal - NYC or Montreal - Miami they are late. Last time I went to Miami, flight delayed of 6 hours. Last time I went to NYC (1 hour flight), flight delayed of 2 hours. Don’t bother bringing a carry on: they never have space for them. They’ll ask you to check in your bag anyway and you’ll have to wait for it at the airport tray. Only positive thing I would say is that employees are generally very affable. It’s truly not their fault.",16th February 2020,Business,Premium Economy,Toronto to Mumbai,Feb-20,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,16
153,our seats were changed,Gabriel Valente,NotVerified," Toronto to Rome via London. Air Canada treats Aeroplan members as second class citizens I am posting this warning to all those you fly with Air Canada and who use air miles to book flights. Air Canada clearly discriminates amongst its passengers. This is now my second experience and hence definitive confirmation of these discriminatory practices. I recently booked a flight to Europe from Toronto using my aeroplan miles. Upon booking my 2 flights I went through the seat selection process, selected seats and paid $125 each for that privilege. The payment was processed by Air Canada and written confirmation received of those specific seat allocations via email. Weeks later I received an “Air Canada – SEAT CHANGE” notification, arbitrarily moving our seats from Row 18 (seats bought and paid for – for extra legroom due to a leg issue I have) to Row 33. and then said I would be refunded the seat selection fees. Completely arbitrary and not honoring the initial seat purchase! Since this was the second time this has happened to me, (the first time being much worse, which I will explain later on in this message) I had to speak out. I immediately emailed Air Canada after trying to get a hold of their customer service Dept – advised by an automated call that the wait time was more than 1.5 hrs - really? Maybe this is a factor of the significant quantum of customer complaint volume. I then received the token automated response to my submission form Air Canada “we will address your concern within 30 days”. Hence my public action here! As noted this is the second time this has happened. In 2018, on flights to/from Miami for attending a family wedding, I had booked 4 seats using Aeroplan miles and paid full fare for one seat (full-fare seat for my disabled father) in upgraded seating. We booked almost 8 months in advance, with the express purpose of early booking, being getting our seats assigned together so as to assist my disabled father on/off the plan and supporting him during the flights. Eight months early! All our seat selections were confirmed in writing to us by Air Canada at that time. Again, just before the flight (a week before) we get a notification that our seats were changed. Let me clarify this point - only our Aeroplan booked seats were changed! Not my father’s full-fare seat! I called to complain, they said it just happens. It was too close to the flight to seek any other remedy. In the end, it left us sitting in the back of the plane and my father sitting alone with strangers and without support to deal with his disability! Unbelievable! After our return, I complained through proper AC channels to ascertain the genesis of the change notice, highlighting the blatant fact that only the seats booked with air miles were changed and not full-fare seat. The AC response again was, it happens! The offered me a 25% discount coupon for a future flight. I don’t want coupons! I want honest, fair and non-discriminatory service from a Canadian company. Disgraceful! Now this has happened again and cannot stay silent as it is now clear beyond any doubt that Air Canada discriminates against its passengers. There is one level of service for full-fare passengers and another for Aeroplan members who use air miles to book flights. I encourage all others who have experienced this type of discriminatory treat to rise up and make Air Canada take notice and correct their business practices.",16th February 2020,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Rome via London,Feb-20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,16

The refused to give us compensation for food/meal as it’s not their fault “ it’s the airport's fault”. So, I called the airport’s customer support and told me there’s no such thing as “gates are full”. Poor customer service Air Canada and Toronto Pearson airport.

The entire Mexico City staff is short-tempered, overworked, stressed out, angry and blames the customer for their shortfalls, as in “you should have come to the gate earlier” - as noted, 4 hours in the airport.",14th February 2020,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to Winnipeg via Toronto,Feb-20,2,4,2,2,1,3,2,16
156,problem with missing extra luggage,Frank Nzegwu,TripVerified,  Frankfurt to Calgary. Cabin crew and inflight services were quite decent. I did have some problem with my missing extra luggage. The claims department did not handle the claim fairly. They did pay a claim of $500 which is half the cost of the item i had in the missing luggage. The first sector flight was with Lufthansa from Port Harcourt to Frankfurt.,14th February 2020,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Calgary,Dec-19,4,5,4,4,1,4,2,16
157,one of the worst airlines,Gunjan Sinha,NotVerified," Saskatoon to Frankfurt via Calgary. Not the first time and won't be the last time. Air Canada is by far one of the worst airlines that sometimes I have no choice but to fly with. Poor food, customer service, delays, lost luggage all are daily routine with this carrier.

158,poor hospitality,Sumi Lal,NotVerified," Dubai to Toronto. Poor Service, on a 14.5-hour-long journey they hardly asked for drinks twice. I kept calling the staff using the button which was getting switched off again and again without any show. Finally, I had to go to them for water. Their staff don't take their job seriously - poor hospitality. One time when I asked for water, she said that they are working very hard to deliver food and drinks to the passengers, however, I got the drink and food after 1.5 hours of wait.",12th February 2020,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Toronto,Feb-20,3,2,2,4,3,0,3,16
159,delayed by another 4 hours,S Sri,Not Verified,"Toronto to Delhi. I wonder how this airline with poor standard and worst customer service get to the top rate in North America. Their website systems are getting upgraded for several months and customer calls reach nowhere. On top of all, in my recent international flight, the airline didn't load any baggage of economy class passengers and none of them notified in a 14 hrs flight that got delayed by another 4 hours. Upon arrival, passengers were shocked to know their baggage didn't get loaded at all. How this airline is expecting them to plan their stay or arrange onward travel without baggage?

160,regret trying to use Air Canada,Ashley Nicole,NotVerified," Kelowna to Calgary. I had a family emergency and looked into booking a flight to Kelowna as soon as possible. I very rarely fly with Air Canada and am a proud frequent flyer with WestJet. I regret trying to use Air Canada as it always disappoints and their prices never match their service. Not only did I get downgraded upon boarding my flight from Calgary to Kelowna, but the flight attendants also had no idea what they were talking about and couldn’t organize their thoughts one bit. For a $600 flight, I would expect the staff to at least know how to tell me the safety instructions properly. Now boarding my flight home from Kelowna to Calgary, sure enough, the flight is delayed over an hour. And not only that! The Vancouver flight with Air Canada just announced that they “oversold” the flight and need volunteers to re-book! That is so bad!

161,jettison your plastic options,Adam Gilbert,NotVerified," Calgary to Sydney via Vancouver. The outbound was ok because the flight was empty and the check-in crew was kind enough to provide us with a row each. This was quickly offset by the fact that they didn’t pack the vegetarian food and made little effort to provide a reasonable set of meal options. Late leaving and late to arrive so missed the connecting flight but this can happen so no biggie there I guess. Did well to find a practical solution to this and didn’t lose our baggage which was very much appreciated. CIgnored by staff when the assistance light was on. Staff were very poorly committed to providing a good flying experience. The flight home! Sardine-like conditions but poor food. Chickpea on rice, then in a bun followed by the piece de resistance, avec hash browns. Air Canada - you have a great opportunity to jettison your plastic options and go with bamboo and paper. It’s a disgrace that you have shown no leadership on this basic environmental consideration. 2",9th February 2020,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Sydney via Vancouver,Feb-20,2,1,1,3,3,0,3,17

I had a carefully selected aisle seat reserved. We arrived at the airport I discovered the Seat change. At the gate I checked with the lone, over-worked gate agent. She kept having to re-ask my name.

164,Fare was costly,B Makyesh,TripVerified,  New York to Kingston via Toronto. The check in was smooth. Despite bad weather flight departed on time.  They just served coke/glass of water.

165,AC have lost my bag,Mike Palmer,TripVerified,"  Toronto to New York LGA return. The majority of flights on this route are currently operated by Sky Regional on E175s under the Air Canada Express banner. This morning, waiting at the gate, we got the preboard announcement, followed a minute later by a PA stating the flight was now cancelled due to the aircraft going tech. (followed by a text from AC) Rebooking is automatic and took 15 mins. I found myself (probably due to a low fare class) albeit 50K elite, on a flight at 1320 – some 4.15 hours after my original flight time. A paltry 10 bucks for refreshments was offered (try buying something to eat and drink at Pearson for ten bucks!!) Prior to boarding my new flight, the gate staff confirmed my bag was on the tarmac ready to be loaded. Two handlers at the bottom of the jetty confirmed that 15 bags had been loaded from an earlier flight. Despite these reassurances, having waited at the baggage reclaim – no bag. A queue to report it, an incorrectly filed report by the AC agent, the online system reported my bag would land at 2100 but no bag arrived that evening. On chasing AC the following morning by phone, it turns out my bag had iust been delivered to hotel reception – some 18 hours after I had landed and 11 hours since the bag arrived in New York. (the online report was not updated) I am losing count of the times AC have lost my bag. This is also my third flight cancelled on this route though at least this time the rebooked flight was the same day (unlike the last time). For a company who claim to be the best in North America, I find their continued inability and incompetence to operate their schedule and carry PAX and their bags on the same flight to be getting worse.",3rd February 2020,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to New York (LGA),Jan-20,3,3,2,0,1,0,3,17
166,they have never disappointed me,P Cross,TripVerified,"  Calgary to Quebec City via Montreal. Excellent. The service on this brand new Airbus 220 was flawless. Always appreciate the professional and polite service on Air Canada. Meal was great, entertainment selections plentiful. I will continue to enjoy flying with Air Canada, have been loyal for over 20 years, never a bad experience to record. Some people are impossible to please, even by a company that obviously cares as much about the passenger experience as Air Canada does. This last flight is one of literally hundreds with Air Canada over the years, they have never disappointed me in my travels.

167,has been a bit missing,S Madson,TripVerified,"  Frankfurt to Calgary, B777-300ER economy class. Having flown to and from Europe to and from YYC on Air Canada several times and exclusively since September, I was hoping for a standardized product in economy class. Each time, something has been a bit missing: poor French skills, inaudible captain PA's, etc. The food, entertainment, and cabin cleanliness was relatively standard, including this time. The attendants this time were especially bad. In particular the one who served me, who handed the food to the passenger on the aisle, and have him figure out the portion and pass it to each of us. The announcements were impossible for me to hear because of so much feedback on the PA. Sometimes, French announcements were absent.

We have just learned our sons who are flying Air Canada to meet us today had their flight canceled several hours before departure and rebooked on a later flight.

Flight was deplaned after late boarding due to mechanical issue, then +3 hour delay and gate change with no meal voucher or reimbursement. Once on a new plane and in flight, cabin was horribly hot and service was non-existent. After landing at SEA, no gate was provided – we had to wait for a bus to take us to the terminal, and then had to walk the full length of the SEA terminal to leave. Tried to receive compensation from customer support but they have no phone service for customer support (wild) and refused over email after many attempts.

172,there was no service whatsoever,Joseph Bubyn,NotVerified,"  Flew into Tokyo from Bangkok on ANA, Nippon on a 787, economy class. We were offered water within 30 minutes of takeoff, a full elaborate and delicious dinner after an hour, then another drink service half an hour after that. We were offered a snak and drink again before landing. All of this on a 4.5 hour flight. The seats were a comfortable width with good leg room. This was a great flight experience. We were connecting on Air Canada Flight 2 to Toronto, connection time was 55 minutes, we were at the gate in about 25 minutes, boarding had not started, we boarded and lifted off about 45 minutes late, something about baggage loading problems. We paid extra for a preferred seat were in row 18 at the bulkhead, seat location was good, seat itself was very narrow and uncomfortable. (extra seating probably means extra luggage and with the allowance of 2 checked bags per person might explain luggage loading problems.) Three hours after takeoff there was no service whatsoever, not even water. Then there was an announcement that Air Canada was implementing a new service, they were offering a hot towel service and the availability of both hot chocolate and sparkling in Economy Lass. A special representative was on board to explain this innovation and to hand out a 20 question survey on this startling innovation. Water and a meal service followed. The main was horrible, a tiny salad, a tiny bun and a Twinkie like desert. After a discussion with their service people water was offered more frequently. An attempt to order duty free on board failed, an attendant tried to help but was not able to place the order. The duty free cart came by when I was asleep so no success there. This 11.5 hour flight was a very poor and uncomfortable esperiance. In the last two years we have travelled on KLM, Lufthansa, Air France,West Jet, Bangkok Air. All of these airlines provided better service and a much higher quality food service. Shame on you Air Canada.

173,a serious customer service problem,Dave Smardon,NotVerified,"  London Heathrow to Toronto with Air Canada. I am a million mile flyer so I have a lot of experience with traveling. I fail to understand why the baggage retrieval at Pearson Airport is consistently the worst I have experienced. Comparing Toronto with Paris, London, Zurich, Hong Kong, Vancouver, New York etc. etc. Typically, baggage at Toronto takes 30 to 50 minutes after having passed through customs and immigration. One wonders why the bags are not waiting for the passengers when they emerge from customs and immigration. At most other airports I have my baggage in no more that 20 minutes. In London, my bags are always on the carousel before I arrive. This continues to be an issue at Pearson (Air Canada) Terminal 1. I primarily fly Air Canada so my experience is with them. Frankly, I don’t care whether Air Canada blames Pearson management or whether Pearson blames Air Canada baggage handlers. This is a serious customer service problem that should be rectified. It is an embarrassment to Pearson and Air Canada both. Particularly since other international airports don’t seem to seem to have this problem.",21st January 2020,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Toronto,Dec-19,4,4,0,0,1,0,2,18

175,not a Comfort Class seat,F Deane,TripVerified,"  Biggest Air Canada fan waning after A220 inaugural Flight Experience. I purchased a Comfort Class ticket on the Air Canada inaugural A200-300 flight on January 16th between Montreal and Calgary. When I reached my seat, boarding in Zone 5 I found that my aisle seat was already being encroached on by a Plus Sized passenger who had moved the arm rests up as he could not fit the confines of his seat.  This was certainly not a Comfort Class seat experience from my perspective, although probably an Air Canada bargain at just over $500.  I thought Air Canada would put their topnotch flight attendants on this flight as it was an inaugural flight of a new aircraft type! Instead the economy cabin was blessed with 2 lack lustre crew members. I went to use the washroom at the back of the airplane and two service carts were blocking the access to the lav that was open while the 2 flight attendants were busy snacking and socializing. The male flight attendant later manned the Bistro Cart in the aisle offered the menu to me and I had to ask him if he had my prepaid voucher recorded on his manifest. He looked at a sheet of paper on his cart, then looked above at my seat row and number then offered the meal item and snack item. I chose for a meal item the mac n cheese which was one of the few hot items available. The flight attendant warned me that it would be at least 30 minutes because he would have to heat it up first. This, while the plane was over northern Ontario. I decided by the time we were flying over Saskatchewan, I would check on that 30 minute Mac and Cheese. I went to the rear galley and found a  female flight attendant freshening up her makeup and I asked her if she knew anything about the 30 minute Mac N Cheese I had ordered off the Bistro Cart and she opened the oven and found the cardboard box with the Mac N Cheese which was probably cooking for and hour and a half. She admitted that the Male flight attendant could not remember who ordered the item.",18th January 2020,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Calgary,Jan-20,1,1,3,5,4,5,2,18
176,delayed out of Calgary,GS Sinha,NotVerified," Calgary to Frankfurt via Mumbai. The flight was delayed out of Calgary due mostly waiting for deicing as the weather was not horrible. Upon departure with almost 1.5 hours initial delay, the plane finally made it to Frankfurt with just 1 hour delay. However, they could not make sure that the passengers that were connecting to a Lufthansa flight to Mumbai with just 1.5 hrs connecting time could at least make it to their flight. They have code-share and it is their responsibility. Lufthansa left without a single minute delay leaving passengers stranded at the airport for an indefinite time. There were many plans that have to be completely revised and rebooked with much loss of money and time. Absolutely horrible service by Air Canada, not only this time but most of the time.

177,We used to trust Air Canada,L Mallend,TripVerified," Zurich to Montreal. You have to be careful now with Air Canada. They started playing with their fares to make it as confusing as possible to get as much money as possible from the customer. At the time of booking, we chose a standard economy ticket as opposed to an Economy Light ticket to be sure to get our luggage included in the price and not have to care about it later. We got a booking confirmation also stating that we had in fact paid the Standard Economy fare and that our luggage was included. When we showed up at the airport however, with four pieces of luggage for the whole family, we had to pay 240 CHF additional per way. We were told that since our flight was a codeshare, the rules of the other company applied. We got no help from the Air Canada counter and we could not reach anyone on the phone after an hour of waiting. We wrote an Email to customer service which replied three weeks later stating that it was all our fault for not paying attention, even though their booking confirmation stated false information. That means that we paid more for a fare that did not give us what we expected of it. We used to trust Air Canada but we won't be flying with them anymore if we can't trust the information they present us.",17th January 2020,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Montreal,Dec-19,4,5,5,5,2,0,3,18

I upgraded to Business when doing online check in to give my wife and myself a treat. Entering the plane the first thing we noticed was the horrible condition of the interior. Once we had sat down it only got worse, the seats had an electric reclining system that were so worn out my seat couldn’t even go to the take off position. I could tell how embarrassed the flight attendant was. My wife’s entertainment screen which is located between our seats was held down with white tape and was unusable my screen was so floppy that it had to be held in place by the tray table with a blanket.

Staff from other airlines manage the check in and gates. They’re rude and ignore amy airline status. I needed a printed boarding pass and waited in line for an hour. My seat was given away and I was given a seat at a window towards the back instead of at an aisle with my family towards the front. I proved my seat was changed and they responded that they can’t inconvenience the passenger who has your seat now. ,11th January 2020,Business,Economy Class,Kona to Vancouver,Jan-20,2,2,0,0,1,0,1,18

Sky lounge only serves drinks during certain hours. Sky lounge doesn’t serve any food other than pieces of bread and hummus after 8pm. Seats have no pillows or blankets etc. You’re required to pay to use their in-flight Wi-Fi service for anything other than looking at a map of your flight.

Seats cushions are thin and most uncomfortable. The food and service on board were dreadful. The flight attendants had an indifferent attitude, miserable expression and lack of common courtesy to me. The cabin was excessively hot and despite requests, nothing appeared to be done to alleviate the discomfort.  Music selections were poor and the choice of movies.

182,"strongly recommend avoiding this airline
",V Pearson,TripVerified," On our way down to New Zealand, they lost our bags for 3 days but little did I know that the flight down would be the better flight. This is because on the way back to Vancouver my seat would be paper thin allowing me to feel any movement to the tray table or seat back behind me, the flight would be 30 minutes late and our bags would be late to get to customs, and then after we missed our flight their counter staff wouldn’t help us and say things like “not our problem.” We would still be stuck in Vancouver if Alaska Airlines hadn’t stepped up and rebooked us when the Air Canada customer service called them for help. If you have any other options whether it be a different airline, car, train, your favorite horse, hot air ballon, or even a hydrogen filled zeppelin I would strongly recommend avoiding this airline.",8th January 2020,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Vancouver,Jan-20,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,19
183,cancelled due to weather,Kevin Morstad,NotVerified,  A colleague and I were set to fly out of Toronto to Edmonton on the 5th of January. Flight got cancelled due to weather Customer was completely overwhelmed. Our flight got rescheduled to the next morning and for some reason we got a connecting flight in Calgary. We went early to the airport and tried to change our to another AC flight that was direct to Edmonton scheduled 15min after the Calgary one. The agent told us that flight was delayed an hour so we decided to bite the bullet and just transfer in Calgary. We also didn't want to further complicate our checked baggage finding its way home. Flight to Calgary left on time and went fine. As soon as we arrive in Calgary our flight to Edmonton gets delayed a couple times and eventually cancelled for mechanical issues. Flight rescheduled for the next morning. Colleague and I decided we're better off just renting a car at this point because we can't afford to miss another day of work.

184,contrast between two flights was enormous,S Deane,TripVerified,"  Before we departed, we discovered our return flight was changed by a day only  when we rang Air Canada to upgrade ... just per chance we had booked a connecting flight with Air Canada. Had we booked the connection with a different airline  we would have had to pay for the alteration to our flight. Also, we had to change plans and add another night to our New York accommodation. We had not been informed of the change, goodness know if and when Air Canada might have decided to inform us. The service from Melbourne to Vancouver was appalling. Food and drinks offered were the  minimum for what was a long flight. Alternatively staff on the flight from Vancouver to Montreal were exceptional. They went out of their way to assist, offer snacks, smile and just offer exceptional service. The contrast between the two flights was enormous, unfortunately we received bad service on the long flight. We are yet to make the return flight and it's not looking good.

186,cancelled due to weather,L Han,TripVerified,"  Connecting flight from Toronto to Halifax cancelled due to weather, ok understandable. Rebooked on flight later that night, which I got bumped from. One customer service agent at the desk provided really bad service too, I get that you're tired of dealing with customers but the lady was acting as if her flight got cancelled. She even complained to her colleague about having to hold with Air Canada when phoning to get help with the situation. So I'm put on the 10:00 flight for 06 Jan 2020, I even get checked in and get a boarding pass. An hour later I get an email saying I'm now bumped from this flight and on the 18:30 flight. This cannot be due to weather as the 10:00 flight is not cancelled. Now I've been on hold for over an hour waiting to speak with someone. They really need to hire more customer service agents for the call center considering how much the company is messing up lately. They also told everyone that hotels will not be provided because it was due to weather, stranding a bunch of people. I'm thinking of just getting a full refund and booking with WestJet to get out of here earlier tomorrow.",6th January 2020,Business,Economy Class,Calgary to Halifax via Toronto,Jan-20,4,5,4,4,1,4,4,19

I’m 5’2 and weigh 117 lbs. I could barely move my arms without invading the space of the person sitting next to me.

189,flight to Vancouver was cancelled,S Han,TripVerified,"  My flight to Vancouver was cancelled and I was notified of the cancellation the day before, with a note that a follow up email on the rescheduled flight would be sent. However, I did not get an email. I tried calling in for hours on end with no one to assist and also wrote in requesting for help. Nothing happened. I went down the next day to realise that there was a rescheduled flight that I was not notified of, even through I was booked into it. The staff at the airport did not offer to help and asked us to get back on the phone to get through to the billing, but again did not get through. I did not manage to get on the later flight that day and had to purchase another ticket with United Airlines the next day.  This was a terrible and frustrating experience that left me at a loss of words about Air Canada’s service standards. An airline like Air Canada to have not only missed out communication, have such poor customer service response times and incompetent and dismissive service staff is a triple whammy to one of North America’s best airlines.

190,I now have 8 hours to burn,Peter Sasley,TripVerified,"  Winnipeg to Grande Prairie via Edmonton. Here I sit at Edmonton Airport. I now have 8 hours to burn since my connecting flight was cancelled. Cancelled due to mechanical issues, I totally understand and accept the delay. However, due to the first flight out of Winnipeg that departed at 5 am, I haven't slept yet and a shower would have made the delay so much more bearable. Instead, after pleading with the airline, all they could do is a 10.00 voucher for a coffee and a muffin and ""we're sorry for the inconvenience"".",1st January 2020,Business,Economy Class,Winnipeg to Grande Prairie via Edmonton,Dec-19,3,3,3,0,1,0,1,20
191,baggage did not leave Montreal,Riham Ibrahim,TripVerified,  I traveled to Paris from Ottawa via Montreal on 12/28/2019 along with my 2 kids ( 4 years and 7 years old). I had checked in Ottawa 3 baggage and 1 stroller. Upon arriving in Paris it came to my surprise that none of the checked-in baggage has arrived. Upon checking with the ground staff in Paris I was informed that ground staff in Montreal didn't have enough time to transfer my baggage to the second flight going to Paris. My trip was booked through air Canada website including the transit. I followed up with Baggage services who confirmed that baggage did not leave Montreal and will be send on a different flight. Following arrival it will be scheduled for delivery in Paris. This process could take up to 5 days. I am shocked with the poor level of service Air Canada. ,30th December 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to Paris via Montreal,Dec-19,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,20
192,Not good customer service,Sally Bonnell,NotVerified,"  London Heathrow to Ottawa. When a companies cabin crew apologises for their in-flight entertainment being really bad and in not a good working order for many passengers because the systems are so old, you would think an over haul would have been done: But you would have been mistaken! After three starts and reboots of the system followed by a discussion with ground staff as to how to fix the fact the entertainment system didn't work, the company resorted to 'vouchers' which required a passenger to log into Air Canada's website to be reimbursed! But oh no, don't think you will get anything back, you are.offered 15% off your next flight cost but you must fly within the year. So my question is, what about all those customers who, like me won't be flying again within the year as we saved for this holiday. Not good customer service and most definitely let's Air Canada off the hook as a good 80% probably won't be flying within the year. Well done Air Canada you try to look as if you care but have clearly not put your passengers first.",30th December 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Ottawa,Dec-19,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,20

194,The worst experience,C Secord,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Portland. The worst experience with Air Canada. Who changes their systems during the holiday season? I spent two months trying to buy my seat upgrade but their system wouldn’t take it. And their customer care message just said “sorry, we can’t help you!”. I just ran through the Vancouver airport to make an earlier flight to Portland. They were still boarding passengers and completely refused to help. Had no empathy for the next flight being a four-hour wait. She was not helping and yelled at me for asking more than once. I understand the rules and regulations. I would have been fine with an “I am so sorry, the rules won’t let me add you to this flight”.

196,2 mins late from the check in timeline,Y Mee,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Bogota. Prior to departure, I tried to call air Canada to upgrade my flight several times, each time the wait duration was more than one hour. Finally after several attempts, when I got through to an agent after 60 mind waiting, they told me I have to do the upgrade in the airport. The system doesn’t allow them to do it over the phone, However, when I got to the airport, the ground service people told me I have to do it online it or on the phone, the system doesn’t allow them to do it at the airport, it’s very frustrating that it’s already wasted 2 hours of my life just to get to speak to someone over the phone. No one could help me with my request. After I got to the airport, I was 2 mins late from the check in timeline, I found out that they took my seats away and told me I had to rebook a flight. I had no choice but to go to ticketing booth, after waiting there for almost 2 hours at ticketing booth, the staff had trouble getting through their system after 15 mins of trying, told me because I used Aeroplan miles for my ticket, there is nothing they can do, I have to contact Aeroplan to get a new ticket.  It would be more considerate if they let me know that ticketing booth doesn’t help anyone with aeroplane reward ticket before sending me there, so I don’t waste another 2 hours waiting there pointlessly.

199,will avoid at all costs,Cesar A Carreno,NotVerified," Regina to Montreal via Toronto. What is described below is not a one-time occurrence, it has a rather disturbing high frequency on my travels. Paid for a more expensive flight to arrive earlier as I had an event. Wasted my money due to the delays. The departing flight (AC1114 from Regina to Toronto) was delayed due to ""additional flight preparation time"". The flight was then delayed two more times, to the point of missing my connection. To top it off, when consulting the departing gate to change the missed connection, was instructed to do so in Toronto. I made the big mistake of being nice to them and checked my carry on to assist them with space for other passengers. Big mistake as the whole Air Canada Toronto personnel that I consulted seemed to be trained to purposely do nothing to change a flight if baggage is checked. When requesting for an earlier flight, one of the people asked if I wanted to go on the next flight, to what I answer ""Yes!"" to then tell me he couldn't do it because of the checked luggage and telling me that he needed 1h and 15min for changing. Asked then for a flight apart 1.5 hrs, to what they say ""cannot do with checked luggage"". Do you notice the change of tone there? If this was a single occurrence, I would have said ""one time thing"" but this is the third time out of four flights I've got. Due to the frequency, I will avoid at all cost. I hope you do the same.

203,I like the onboard crew,M Neahle,TripVerified,  Frankfurt to Toronto with Air Canada. What I like about Air Canada is the onboard crew and that they were continuously serving water throughout the flight. Seats and entertainment are average - do big see a big difference to other North American Airlines. What I don’t like is 63 minutes waiting time to call their reservations department. I am not too impressed by their onboard catering in regard to quantity and quality.

205,best in class service,David Zaltzman,NotVerified,  Toronto to Vancouver. Upon boarding at Toronto Pearson airport at gate 38 on December 18 2019 the Air Canada crew noticed that although I have super elite status my seat was way at the back. When inquiring about it I told Annette that it was a last minute booking and no other better seat was available. Without asking for any change Annette asked me if I didn’t mind to wait for a second to check if there was a better seat for me. Within few seconds she came back with a new boarding pass and a better seat. That is the best service when you really don’t expect it.

206,totally unacceptable,T Jones,TripVerified," Boston to Tokyo via Toronto. My first flight on Air Canada this morning was delayed due to weather. When I arrived in Toronto I had missed the connection and they handed new boarding passes which get me to my destination two days after I was supposed to arrive. I was taking this flight because it was nonstop and paid for premium economy. They’ve provided me with a hotel for one night but I end up now going through Korea and have to spend a night in the airport without a hotel. I have been on hold on their help phone for over one hour. I have also been at the customer ticketing booth and took a number which was number 243 3: 207 PM today and after an hour and 15 minutes, they had only served 40 people. I Was on hold for over one hour when someone finally answered. After explaining the situation and indicating I would be willing to go to a different airport in Tokyo the woman said to please hold and after about 15 minutes I was disconnected. I am now starting over and I’m now on hold to speak to someone again. I’ve tried calling them myself on my cell phone however if you listen to the recording it literally says that they will not take your call because of their new reservation system. Please see photos showing how they have rebooked me with three additional flights going through another country and ending up at my destination two days later. This is totally unacceptable and I can’t even speak to someone to see if there are any alternatives which is why I am posting this review as I stay on hold. In addition, I went to three lines at the airport to try to get help and each person sent me somewhere else. I will never ever fly this airline again. It’s one thing to offer me a hotel in Toronto this evening but then to expect me to arrive in Korea and spend the night on a chair waiting for a flight is also unacceptable aside from all these time issues. Thank goodness I sent my family from New York on United Airlines.

207,new app never works for me,G Lanelli,TripVerified,"  Montreal to Toronto. Their new app never works for me nor it is up to date. Is that difficult to update to provide accurate information that is critical for passengers? The entertainment device was scratched, broken and/or defective. Some planes have defective seats and non-working electric outlets. If you complain, they offer you $50-$100 as if that would solve the problem or if that was a fair compensation.

208,booking reference no longer existed,C Strumpher,TripVerified,"  I’ve spent the last month attempting to organize my itinerary. I waited a total of 6 hrs on hold for their customer service line. Each time they hung up on me (before I could speak) or an answering machine informed me they couldn't even put me on hold or take my call. I had to make multiple trips to the airport to ask questions that should be cleared online or over the phone, though they failed to give such options which were available in the past. I understand they're reworking their ""system"" but this is insane.  I don't appreciate the website telling me to see an Air Canada employee in person, only to go to a local airport (London, Ontario) to find the lady refusing to help me after I found out for no reason explained to me that my booking reference no longer existed the day before I'm supposed to leave. She kept saying “I don’t know. Can’t help you” even though she has the tools to look up my booking to see if there’s any issues on my end or hers. I had to ask her work colleague for help. It turned out the problem was a very simple one, and my time and theirs would’ve been saved if she had been happy to do her job and help me the moment I asked her.",17th December 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Winnipeg via Toronto,Dec-19,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,21
209,we had to switch planes,M Vardon,TripVerified,"  Calgary to Toronto. After boarding the plane we were told that we might have to switch planes due to that one needing repairs, so we had to wait another 15 minutes to find out, then the captain announced that we had to switch planes and that the next one would be there at 10:45. So I went to my next gate and the plane didn’t arrive until about 11:30. The captain and crew assured us that they were taking care of the connection issues, which may have been true for some people but not for me.  My in flight entertainment didn’t work and the charging ports didn’t work. I ended up just sleeping the whole flight anyway since I have flu. When we landed in Toronto and I could use my phone again I had a notification saying they rebooked my next flight which was to Timmins but I was flying on the 14th and they rebooked me for the 16th even though there was a flight that night to Timmins with room on it. I had to pay over $300 for a ticket onto that flight because of their mistake. I had to wait another 3 hours in the Toronto airport for my next flight. I was supposed to have been in Timmins by 6:30 that night but didn’t make it there till almost 12 in the morning.",16th December 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Toronto,Dec-19,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,21
210,satisfied and surprised,Houssem Abdellatif,NotVerified,"  Flew with Air Canada long haul business class from Toronto to Munich. I was satisfied and surprised. I flew to Toronto from Edmonton. When arrived in Pearson Terminal 3, an air Canada agent was waiting for me holding a plate with my name. She offered me a chauffeur service with a nice BMW 7 series to the terminal 1, from where my flight to Munich will depart. I was astonished as i am not a frequent flyer of Air Canada but just a star alliance gold member. The signature lounge of air Canada was amazing. Dining a la carte at the restaurant brilliant. Service on board was great. the seats in business class were very spacious. you can really spread out. I did not like the seat in flat mode though. Somehow the seat was quite hard.

211,hire agents who actually care about helping passengers,Catherine Cheng,NotVerified,"  The flight from Taipei to Vancouver was decent. But it was hard to get comfortable in the seats in order to catch some sleep on the 10 hour journey. What made us most angry was our treatment at Vancouver airport while trying to catch our connecting flight back to Toronto. We had less than 2 hours to go through customs, get our baggage, then recheck baggage before boarding. Of course going through security was slow and on top of that, baggage claim had mechanical issues so we were delayed another 10 minutes. By the time we reached baggage drop off, the agent simply told us too late and that we missed our flight. No explanation or any effort whatsoever to reach out to the agents boarding for our flight. We got redirected to a check in area where we were then booked as standby for the next flight with the agent telling us that we would most likely get on. Now we understand seats are not guaranteed but at least have the agents be a little empathetic about our situation that was not our fault. Cue boarding time for the standby flight: the agent was rude and bluntly told all standbys that we were not getting on. Naturally people were upset and wanted answers. But this particular agent was so rude and yelled back at everyone to shut up as there was nothing she can do on her end. Funny, I thought these agents are supposed to provide customer service? Didn't know being yelled at and made to feel like missing our original flight was part of their job description. I can understand feeling attacked when you have angry customers all come at you, but that's part of your job to be able to keep your cool in these situations! After a bit of yelling back and forth, she rebooked us all as standbys for the last flight of the night with a small chance of boarding as this was yet another full flight. She couldn't or wouldn't tell us what our other options are if we were to be denied this last flight as well. So here we are waiting for the last flight hoping to get on while we're all upset with how we were just treated. Long story short, the flight crew was lovely but ground staff? Please hire agents who actually care about helping passengers who are stuck here. It's not like we all voluntarily decided to skip our original flights in favour of playing chance with the later flights. Worst customer service experience we've ever experienced. Would highly recommend avoid flying with Air Canada if you can.

212,I am extremely disappointed,E Molton,TripVerified," On Sat 30 November 2019, I was due to fly from London to Chicago, via Toronto. I successfully completed the London to Toronto leg of my journey. All of my problems began with the Toronto to Chicago leg of this journey (UA 7673 on 30 November 2019). I boarded the plane, but was then told that there was a fault with the plane. All passengers were told to disembark the plane. I expected to be booked on to another flight for that day, but was informed by Air Canada Staff at the gate that there would be no further flights that day. I was told to collect my luggage and leave the airport. I was given the Air Canada customer support phone number and was told to contact them to arrange an alternative flight. I tried calling this number continuously for the next 12 hours. I was unable to get through to a customer support agent, despite holding for up to 4 hours! I kept getting a message saying that I could not be placed on hold, with a request to call back later. The message did not change for the whole time I was ringing! When I checked my booking online, I could see that my YYZ to ORD had been rescheduled for 4 days later (Wednesday 3 December 2019). This was despite the fact that there were numerous seats available on Air Canada flights between Toronto and Chicago on the 1st and 2nd of December. As I was unable to contact Air Canada customer support to arrange an alternative flight, I had no choice but to make my own arrangements for travel to Chicago. I proceeded to book a flight from Buffalo NY to Toronto for Sunday morning 1 December 2019 at 7.15 am. I am extremely disappointed by Air Canada. I understand that planes can occasionally develop a fault, leading to a cancellation.

This trip to Atlanta and back has been one of the worst we’ve experienced. The flight FYI Toronto to Atlanta was over 3 hours late. Although weather was a factor, the messages to passengers were very misleading. The return flight was 35 minutes delayed, with no explanation. My entertainment system did not work, after informing the attendant, he provided a discount claim card, which lead us to believe this was a known issue. I wouldn’t have been so put off, but overheard other passengers in business class saying they were given complimentary upgrades. Their entertainment systems worked fine, while mine, which was a fully paid Bus Class ticket did not.

The latest one has my out going flight leaving 4 hours early causing me to have to leave work early to catch it and the return they decided to add an 8hr stop over right in the middle. The 8 hour stop over also causes me to get in late at night. I paid for the flights I booked because they work for the time off i booked. I didnt pay to have my itinerary changed for the worse.

But unfortunately WestJet doesn't do direct flights to San Francisco, so I was stuck on Air Canada again this month. And as always the experience was terrible. It is a total joke that they say they are the highest rated North American airline. They are the worst airline that I have flown on. The staff are completely unfriendly and not helpful. The flights are almost always late. I am waiting on my flight back and felt the need to write this review since my inbound flight is late so not really surprized.

217,avoid using Aeroplan in the future,J Neale,TripVerified,"  I used Air Canada's reward system Aeroplan to book a flight and could only get a seat on a United flight. It went through the system including assigning a seat. However, it said it was unticketed. I waited 24 hours to see if the ticket was issued - and then spent hours trying to get through to both Air Canada and Aeroplan after United told me that I should contact them to put a priority on issuing the ticket ASAP because they would cancel the reservation if it is not issued soon. Both contact centres talk about changes to the reservation system and it is causing lots of problems - but this has been going on for weeks based on comments on various forums. And they point the blame on each other - despite one being bought out by the other. The lack of effort to add more staff and to extend Aeroplans hours is disgraceful and and both parties should be ashamed by their lack of acceptance that customer are paying the consequences of an ill planned change. After spending hours dialing to just get into the queue to talk to Air Canada or Aeroplan [I had two phones going at the same time]. I finally spoke to a human at Air Canada who refused to acknowledge any connection to Aeroplan tickets and basically said keep trying to connect. Honestly I spent over 5 hours continuously redialing the Aeroplan number which stopped working at midnight. I have less that 36 hours before I am suppose to fly and no ticket. I would donate my points to charity as I plan to avoid using Aeroplan in the future, but it would be such a mean gesture to give something that could never be used.",4th December 2019,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Toronto,Nov-19,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,22
218,trying endlessly to retrieve our baggage,L Rhodes,TripVerified,"  Frankfurt to Nashville via Toronto. Our Frankfurt to Toronto leg was perfect. Staff was friendly, plane was comfortable, and flight was great. Once landing in Toronto, the chaos ensued. Our Nashville leg was cancelled due to weather (freezing rain and snow). Totally understandable. However, what wasn't understandable was the sheer incompetence of the Air Canada agents that helped customers. Once we arrived at the connections gate for the US flights, there was 1 Air Canada agent helping over 200 people that needed a flight rebooked. On top of that, they apparently had a new rebooking system, so she couldn't actually rebook anyone without having to wait on the phone with another department to see if anything was available. The first person in line took 2 hours to get resolved. I was fourth in line. Finally my husband and I received a hotel voucher after about 2.5 hours of waiting in the line. They stopped trying to rebook anyone and just immediately gave us a hotel. Then they told us we need to call their reservations hotline to get rebooked. No one would rebook us without calling this number and the hold times for that number were over 2 hours and longer with frequent disconnects. We were told to exit customs and go downstairs to baggage claim to collect our stuff and head to the hotel. We waited 8 hours for our baggage and it never came.  We spoke to baggage agents 7 times and had them call our specific bag tag numerous times over with no luck. One agent even showed us a picture of our baggage scanned into the warehouse and knew the exact cage number it was stored in, but no one would retrieve it for us. Baggage agents instead walked around telling people to wait for carousel 10 to have their bags (which was futile) or openly started arguing with customers. ""Have you seen the weather? It's out of our control! There are many people here waiting, you need to wait!"" I asked one agent if he could radio for a manager and he said he couldn't, that there was no way for him to get a manager, and that he could not help. The customer service was atrocious. We all knew that weather was not something they could not control, but the baggage operations are within their control and it was a complete and utter failure.  After being awake for over 24 hours and trying endlessly to retrieve our baggage, we had to give up. The next morning we ended up hiring a limo service to take us to Buffalo in order to rent a car to get to Nashville. We were never able to contact the rebooking department for help and no one in the airport could help us. My husband has filed a baggage claim for them to send it to us, if they ever get around to getting it. After this, my husband and I have decided to avoid Air Canada at all costs.",3rd December 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Toronto via Nashville,Dec-19,3,3,3,4,1,3,1,22

Online check-in not possible, as ticked issued by United under a code-share flight number, thus stuck in a middle seat for the first leg. London to  Toronto uneventful, plane clean, crew indifferent, service average. Transfer in Toronto - a disorganized disaster. Premium security lane for US bound flights was an insult. Nobody in the airport seemed to be at work, or willing to do anything. Flight was originally delayed by 45 due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft and moved to a new gate. At the new gate, another hour delay was announced. 10 minutes prior to new boarding time, a further 2 hour delay and new change of gate was announced. No attempt from staff to provide water or vouchers. 20 minutes after moving to the new gate (at the opposite end of the terminal), a new announcement came through that the aircraft was now ready to board at the original gate. Following a sprint back to the old new gate on the opposite end of the terminal, finally boarded. Left gate 2 hours after the originally scheduled time and lined up for de-icing, which lasted for another hour or so. Cabin crew did not offer anything during that time except for headphones. Finally airborne, three and a half hours after the originally scheduled time, an apology from the purser for the delay and the generous offering of free headphones to compensate for the inconvenience. Meal for purchase and drinks service began almost 2 hours after take-off, due to sporadic turbulence. First went the cart with the meals for purchase. Water was offered to me for the first time 4 hours after I boarded the plane. Air Canada did not offer any compensation for the four hour delay.",3rd December 2019,Business,Economy Class,London to Los Angeles via Toronto,Dec-19,2,1,2,4,1,2,1,22
220,worst ground staff,M Nelson,TripVerified," Took flights from Melbourne to Newark airport via Vancouver. All services up to arriving at Newark was good. However, after 2 hours of waiting for baggage, we have learned that my suit did not come with the aircraft I took from Vancouver. This happened to all people flew from Melbourne. No staff informed any of us the issue until one of us approached the Air Canada service desk. Even after founding out that baggage were misplaced and not arriving the airport on the same date, none of the Air Canada staff were supportive, helpful nor agile ('it is not my fault that baggage did not arrive' quote from an Air Canada ground staff). All reactive with reluctance and very slow process. We had about 20 to 25 people facing the same issue after almost 25 hours of travelling from Melbourne including several very small kids. This is not about missing luggage but about extremely poor services provided to their customers on this occasion. I flew on business class and left the airport without my suitcase after 3.5 hours of arrival due to the extremely inattentive and slow process. This is the worst ground staff service I ever received. Yet, they cannot guarantee if the luggage will be delivered to the assigned address nor could confirm the compensation value they would cover to suffice the minimum required supplies customers need until the luggage/s are returned.",1st December 2019,Business,Business Class,Melbourne to Newark via Vancouver,Nov-19,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,23
221,Relatively clean airplane,S Vandeault,TripVerified,"  Quebec to Seoul via Toronto. Relatively clean airplane. No delays. Luggage arrived in good condition and on time. My food was horrible, below average service for me. On this flight i had to get the trash from my tray 3 hours after my meal, walk to the back of the plane. Then I asked the hostess do you have a trashbin please, can i have water please and can i have a snack please? 10 minutes later, they came down the aisle to offer water to the passengers.

The flight we had to take from Vancouver to Montreal was now the red eye flight leaving at 23.00. We were now a day late for our hotel reservation and no excuses from Air Canada. On top of that, now we are trying to call Air Canada from Portugal to cancel our flight from Paris to Montreal but cannot get to the customer services due to what they call their new customer service operating computorized system.

223,configuration is the worst,J Mercer,TripVerified,  London to Calgary. This Boeing 787 configuration is the worst I’ve flown.

224,connecting flight left early,J Newell,Not Verified,"Toronto to Vancouver. Flight was delayed 1 hr, we asked flight attendants to make it known that our connecting flight (also Air Canada) would be tight for a turnaround time. We were assured time would be made up in the air and our connecting flight was in the gate beside where we were arriving. They were right about the location, but we were denied boarding because that connecting flight left early. Air Canada proposed sending us to Sydney first and then to Brisbane as a workaround.

225,nice planes and decent service,Sukhbir Bolina,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to London. Check in at the airport was OK, however, Air Canada had just switched over to a new system. Therefore, they were unable to confirm my seats for my onward flight from LHR. The aircraft boarded without any issues and it was a very new looking plane. Quite clean and sparkling actually. The main area that let me down was the food. I had ordered an Asian Vegetarian meal and it was very average in quality and quantity. Nothing to impress in this regard. The service was OK otherwise. The plane took off and landed on time. Air Canada - you have nice planes and decent service on board. Please improve your food and I might fly with you more often.",29th November 2019,Business,Economy Class,Vancouver to London,Nov-19,3,3,2,3,4,0,4,23
226,service was not business class level,S Malinen,TripVerified," We had purchased business class or signature class, as Air Canada calls the service with flat beds, tickets. Air Canada changed the aircraft, which had only premium economy and economy class. This A330 is an old SIA / TAP plane with old SIA interior. The service was not business class level, only premium economy. No bread, just butter! Afterwards we wanted to have compensation as we over paid for the service. Cabin service director on that flight, Air Canada website and our own eyes confirmed, layout was premium economy. Ever since then Air Canada has refused to compensate us. ""...Requesting a refund for the downgrade from Signature Class to PY. On our end, it shows this passenger was ticketed in Business flew in Business and no downgrade refund is due. Please note, there is nothing further we can respond. Thank you for the final opportunity to review your request."" Air Canada has a very primitive way of communication, and they simply do not care if they have made a mistake, and fraudulently ""stolen"" your money.

227,a major disappointment,Christopher Neep,TripVerified," Fly between Vancouver and London Heathrow frequently and decided to fly in Air Canada Premium Economy in November. The experience was a major disappointment - the Air Canada premium product is far below the standard offered by other major carriers, including British Airways on the same route. Dinner was marginally better than economy class but wines were exactly the same as offered in economy. Breakfast was appalling - a slice of cake, a small yogurt and one cup of weak coffee. The food on BA is considerably better and they provide a hot breakfast. While the seat was more comfortable than in economy, it came with a flimsy pillow and a useless acrylic sheet that passed for a blanket. BA provides a quilted blanket. Service was generally mediocre; none of the FAs seemed interested in their jobs. Overall, Air Canada’s Premium Economy product and service is disappointing and definitely not worth the hefty additional cost.",27th November 2019,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Vancouver to London,Nov-19,3,2,1,3,4,0,2,23
228,delayed due to security malfunction,B Marques,TripVerified,"  Some of the worst customer service I have experienced. We were delayed due to a security malfunction in the screening area. We arrived at the gate at 7:06am and were denied entrance for our 7:00am flight. Many people were paged over the intercom about their flights giving them warnings and we were not. The lady at customer service then had the audacity to say “if you were paged, would you have made it?” As if it’s not their responsibility to do so regardless. Also the same lady said there was a flight at 8:00am but she couldn’t book us in because of the time. I was furious at this point as they sent us back out to the ticketing booth where there were about 15 employees behind the desk and only 3 at the computer. We waited over and hour to be attended to. At this point I just wanted to get on the next flight when I was told that a one way ticket would be $700 - more then our original round trip. An absolute scam if you ask me, but of course with everything already booked we really had no choice.",26th November 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Calgary,Nov-19,1,2,0,0,1,0,1,23

Don't trust anything there agents tell you on the phone or in-person about there cancellation policies, no matter what type of ticket you buy you will get screwed out of money!

230,no apology from Air Canada,R Wilson,TripVerified," Booked the flight, Vancouver to San Diego return, because of the departure times. Sometime later the return flight was changed from 12.35 to 17.00 and now arriving into Vancouver at around 20.00 instead of around 15.39 but by now this was too late to get an alternative carrier. At San Diego airport time of departure was listed as on time but a little later was changed to 18.00 then 18.16. It was not until 18.45 we actually took off as we had to wait for the incoming flight which actually arrived at 18.05 to off-load and be cleaned, etc. We finally arrive in Vancouver at 21.50 with no apology from Air Canada. At check-in at San Diego I was told that I had to put my carry-on under the seat (it is smaller than the 55cm x 23cm x 40cm allowed), this did not happen for the Vancouver to San Diego part. So now I was sitting for over 3 hours with my feet on top of a 20cm bag and could not lower the tray as my knees were too high.",19th November 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Vancouver,Nov-19,1,2,3,1,3,0,1,24

234,no regard for their customers,Kyrus Ingalls,NotVerified,"  Worst experience with an airline. We flew from Montego Bay to Toronto Canada as a layover. As we boarded the plane the Captain advised that it was snowing in Canada, but we will be on time. As we arrived to the Toronto airport we spent a hour and a half on the runway. Due to traffic and the airline plowing. You would think they would of plowed ahead of time or at least prepped for snow. So are connecting flight was boarding in 20 minutes as we lay in wait on the runway. We checked Air Canada site and it stated that our connecting flight was delayed 2 hours. So my wife and I believed we had time to make the connecting flight being that we were sitting for our an hour on the runway. Well we were wrong not only didn’t they let people with connecting flights exit off plane first but the staff and the website lied about the delay. (The connecting flight was on time) As we approached the gate to our flight we were stopped and not allowed to enter US customs because they closed at 9pm. We arrived at the gate at 849pm and had time to walked 50 feet to customs. But not to our knowledge Air Canada already rebooked our flight for the following day for 920pm without advising us. The staff was rude and blamed it on US customs even after we told them we have 11 minutes. Then they advised that we couldn’t go through customs because our check bag was on our previous flight. We explained that they can send the bag at a later date because we have to get home to our kids. Note there are over 25 other people they denied as well. Also, other airlines sent our check bag at a later date of flights were running late. Furthermore, Air Canada did book our hotel rooms but did not state when we had to check out. So at 11am the next day we received a phone call that we have to check out. Our flight wasn’t due to arrive until 920pm. What were we supposed to do from 11am to at least 7 pm. With no winter clothes because we are coming from Jamaica and we didn’t have our clothes due to the checked bag being on the previous plane. We called several Air Canada customer service lines and we met with excuses. I will never fly Air Canada or will recommend this airline. We were warned but decided to try them out anyway. Lastly, my wife checked for flights and they had a flight leaving Toronto at 11am the next day but Air Canada boomed is on the last flight leaving because it was more convenient for them.

235,the ticket was pending payment,Melissa Roy,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Providenciales. This is the second time within a year that I have shown up to the airport in Toronto to check in for my flight to discover that the ticket I had booked through their app did not get paid. Last time I missed my flight entirely and Air Canada did nothing to rectify the situation telling me it was an issue with my bank. I ended up flying American. This time I once again arrived at the airport to check in, to discover I had to go to ticketing and purchase the ticket. At no point in either of these situations did I receive a notification that the ticket was pending payment, rather I received a reference number and 24 hours prior to my flight I began receiving check in notifications. This was the similar experience I had last flight. This time when I booked the flight I had my bank on the phone to ensure it wasn’t on their end. They confirmed it was not. Both times due to their issue I was inconvenienced and stressed about not being able to return home to my family in time. Air Canada charged me for my baggage and only offered up that it must be an issue with my bank. Unacceptable service and poor communication. Thankfully I was able to get on my flight this time.

After booking my ticket, I called to book my 2 cats in the cargo hold. I was moving across the country. Everything was fine and I booked my pets. On the day of the flight, I arrived at the airport only to be turned away due to an embargo on flying pets. They did nothing to rectify this and left me stranded.

238,I enjoyed the cabin feel,Thomas Lauder,NotVerified,"  London to Toronto. I found this trip on Air Canada's B777-300ER pretty overwhelming. I enjoyed the cabin feel and the colours.  The IFE was not going to be activated till after takeoff, and that meant that there would be no WiFi until the IFE was on. Then came a cockpit PA 'Attention passengers, this is your captain speaking. We will be delayed by 1 hour due to an accident on the apron.' That accident was a pushback truck that broke down, and they needed to move it. They couldn't turn on the IFE until at least one engine was on. One hour later we pushed back, and the IFE came on. I decided to check out the entertainment selection. As this was a 1:30 PM flight, lunch was served shortly after takeoff. My cheesy pasta was sufficient. After the meal, I checked the WiFi, and the prices were pretty reasonable. $29.78 for full flight of WiFi (that's 5 hours from LHR-YYZ).

240,need to improve their game,F Gersen,TripVerified,"  Montreal to Tokyo. The welcoming staff at Montreal airport was unbelievably rude. The check-in machines were not working and there was only one desk open for the check-ins. One desk for the largest company in one of the most important airports in Canada, unbelievable. After 20 minutes of waiting without any improvement, people started asking the staff what was happening and we were just told; ""20 minutes is nothing, if you're still in line in 6 hours you can come talk to me again but before that, it's not my problem, get over it"". The rest of the check-in and management staff on the ground though were all very nice and accommodating after I have to say. The flight was a 13,5 hours to Tokyo in a Boeing 787. Plane was nice enough and all the cabin crew staff were very good and welcoming. I was not expecting much for the food but this went beyond anything I had. The chicken was white and dry and had a blend tomato sauce with it...I actually felt sick and disgusted after eating it. I don't know what the breakfast was supposed to be but I could not finish it. For an airline that considers itself the best in North America, they really really need to improve their game. ",2nd November 2019,Business,Economy Class,Montreal to Tokyo,Oct-19,3,4,1,3,1,0,1,25
241,tells them to charge the change fee,W Chan,TripVerified,"  Atlanta to Toronto on an Embraer 175. Check-staff were not welcoming to me and did their basic duties without much enthusiasm. My ticket terms stated that I was eligible for same-day standby on an earlier flight, but they insisted on charging me for the change, and could not offer any explanation except ""the computer says so"". I showed them my ticket and again, they said the computer tells them to charge the change fee. This despite the fact that I had called the airline and the customer service agent on the phone told me to show up early at the airport to make the change free of charge. The flight was rather uneventful. The plane was old, and seats cramped in Economy. The crew were similarly very disinterested and unenthusiastic to me. At the end of the flight, the chief purser stood by the door texting on his phone, and barely acknowledged the passenger disembarking - the crew on the outbound flight three days earlier was a remarkable contrast. Half way through the flight, the entertainment system broke down.

He initially could not find any availability for me and I hung up, very disappointed, after thanking him. Gonzalo then did something which NO other Air Canada agent has done and  called me back!  He then proceeded to assist me with exactly what I needed. I cannot thank him enough!

243,Air Canada flights were great,Carol Hathaway,NotVerified,"  We spend several months traveling this Summer and flew with a number of airlines, and Air Canada was the best, head and shoulders above others. They were efficient in getting people on and off their flights, the crew and staff were friendly and genuinely helpful. We didn't expect food on our flights. Not only was there food, but it was good. They have a stopover program, which allowed us to stopover in Toronto for no extra charge. The flight attendants, between them, spoke 7 languages. Where there were lines, the moved people with soon to be departing flight to the front of the line. Here is an example of how great the Air Canada people are. On our flight from London to Toronto there was a man who had taken his 3 children to London (by himself) for a holiday and they were returning home. His 3 children sat together behind us and he sat in an aisle seat across from them. Not long into the flight an exhausted dad fell asleep and the flight attendants took over. Mind you the children were delightful, but the flight attendants were amazing with the children. The flight staff made that flight pleasant for everyone. That was the daytime.flight from London to Toronto on October 15th and the flight staff really should be commended. While that flight was remarkable, all our Air Canada flights were great.

244,completely unhelpful,G Pierce,TripVerified," Sudbury to Calgary via Toronto. When I booked my ticket, from Sudbury to Calgary the Air Canada website did not show any available options. I had to book Sudbury to Toronto and Toronto to Calgary separately in order to get from Sudbury to Calgary - the website did not do this automatically. The only Toronto-Calgary flight showing was 6h later than preferred (even though this is a frequently travelled route). Thinking that was the only option, I booked it. When I checked again, a few days before my departure, it turns out there were a number of earlier flights available. When I asked to change flights as a result of the website malfunction, the Air Canada employee was completely unhelpful and refused to change my flight notwithstanding my flights were booked at a time during which the Air Canada website was obviously not working properly. Air Canada's failings were many: inability to book a connecting flight on the Air Canada website, failing to show other available flights, and failing to be of any help whatsoever. I am forced to give them a poor rating. I've escalated my claim and will revise my rating if a supervisor ends up being more helpful than the employee who took my call.",24th October 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sudbury to Calgary via Toronto,Oct-19,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,25

Food could have been better; Air Canada do not appear to have changed their menu on this route for over a year. IFE quite good though BA offer a  wider choice on this route. Boeing 777-300ER with Air Canada's high density seating configuration is extremely uncomfortable. The seats are very narrow and uncomfortable, aisles very narrow and leg room very limited (I'm 5' 9"""" tall).

The vegetarian meal was excellent: full of flavour, quality ingredients and was an appropriate size. Red wine on board was delicious as well. I had decided to abandon Air Canada for international flights until I took this flight. It seems, based on my conversation with a crew member, that the airport of origin matters, although I hope it doesn't! Crew was very kind and accommodating, nothing could have been better about this flight given the amount I paid for this portion of my trip. They have an ample selection on their in-flight entertainment system; although I do not judge an airline's quality based on that nor the availability of Wi-Fi; but rather treat them as bonuses.",20th October 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Montreal,Oct-19,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,25

Then my flight was delayed a ton and they didn’t think it’d be an issue with me landing 5 minutes after boarding started on my connection. I brought this up to customer service multiple times and they just shrugged and dismissed it without any investigation or consideration. Once I arrived they canceled my connecting flight because they couldn’t transfer the luggage that I was forced to check on time. They scheduled me for a flight literally 24 hours later. I refused and asked for an alternate so they sent me to Vancouver and say they’ll have a hotel for me on arrival. I arrive at 11:30 and they have no clue about any hotel. I’m dealing with them for another hour before they get management to book a room. I don’t get to it till nearly 1:30 am. I leave wake up at 5:30 to get ready and catch my morning connection. While in immigration and customs line I get a text saying they canceled my connection and pushed me back to another flight 2 hours later. I called customer service and they just gave the same dismissive attitude. At this point, I’m running off of 4 hours of sleep and have missed all my work meetings for the day. They show no sense of remorse or need to remedy it. I called to demand some sort of refund but they just said to send them an email. Not worth the price they charge by a long shot and by far the most garbage experience I’ve ever had with an airline.",16th October 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Seattle,Oct-19,2,2,2,2,1,4,1,26
253,wonderful staff and captain,B Richelle,NotVerified,  Dublin to Toronto with Air Canada. 7+ hour flight. Boarded and took off quickly. Really wonderful staff and captain.

254,unpleasant and unprofessional,J Shipra ,NotVerified,"  I have been flying Air Canada - Toronto-Delhi-Toronto for the last 3 years (Premium Economy and Business), at least once a year. The service has been good and bad i.e. not really consistent but nothing so bad that it would motivate me to take time out to write a review. However, this time when I was flying direct to New Delhi from Toronto on Oct 8th, AC042, 22.10 departure, I had some experiences worth noting. Once we settled in the air hostess came to take our dinner order (choice between veg and non-veg). Coincidentally, my husband and I were the last 2 people she got to in a section of 22 passengers. Her words were: Unfortunately you will have to get the vegetarian option as that’s the only option left. We got a little irritated by her choice of words as we have paid the same fare as every other passenger in that section. So if every other passenger has been given a choice, why shouldn’t we be. And we expressed this with the air hostess. She said: “I will bring someone else to talk to you about it.” She then comes back after having a chat with her colleagues and said they’ll see what they can do about the meal. I am vegetarian so I would have chosen that option anyway. But just the way she said it was quite unprofessional. Over the span of the rest of the 13 hour flight, she was quite unpleasant and unprofessional whenever she would be serving us. She came to our seats to get our meal trays back but no thank you or a smile. Courtesies like these are basic tenats of any customer-facing industry, let alone airlines or hospitality which is quite a competitive market. Additionally, I rang the call bell once during my entire flight, and it took the staff 20 minutes and multiple times switching off and on to grab one of their attention. Even though they were walking up and down the aisle a couple of time. Maybe Air Canada needs to invest in training their staff on how to provide the best customer service that they claim in their advertising. Overall, it was quite disappointing for the fare prices we paid.",12th October 2019,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Toronto to New Delhi,Oct-19,4,1,1,5,5,0,2,26
255,hosts seem frustrated,B Geare,TripVerified,  Osaka to Vancouver. Air hosts seem frustrated and made us feel as if they were doing us a favour by having us on board. I’m not going to complain about seats and food because yes when you pay for economy you’re not expecting luxury. Even just making way on the aisle and the simple requests were not pleasant exchanges. The air conditioning was leaking on my seat and tissue had been stuffed into the vent to prevent this. After take off it stopped but when notifying the cabin crew there was an issue they just said we can’t do anything about it. I didn’t ask for anything but just to notify them there was tissue shoved in the vent. Don’t really expect much from North American Airlines. The east and Middle East do a much better job in all classes. ,10th October 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Vancouver,Oct-19,2,1,1,2,2,0,2,26
256,So disappointed with them,M Ritz,NotVerified, I have no idea how Air Canada has won any awards. I fly with them monthly and have nothing but issues with this airline. Last flight from Chicago to Vancouver I get a text that there is an issue with the entertainment system and the plane didn't even have screens on a flight over 4 hours. My flight home to Edmonton we were given 3 seats to myself and not one of the headphone jacks worked.

258,this crew went above and beyond,Janet Snell,TripVerified,"  This past Thursday we were on our way back to Vancouver from DC through Montreal with Air Canada. On the second leg of the trip, we were seated in the 15th row (preferred seating) in front of the exit row and discovered our seats didn’t recline. We asked the flight director if we could move and before take off he remembered our request and moved us to two vacant bulkhead seats. The rest of the flight crew were just as professional and attentive. We felt it was important to acknowledge that this crew went above and beyond to make our trip enjoyable!",6th October 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Washington, DC to Vancouver via Montreal",Oct-19,5,5,3,5,5,3,5,26
259,not one crew member came to my assistance,Aaron Tabasum,NotVerified,"  Toronto to New Delhi. I waited to purchase duty-free and was told that the it was impossible to do so as there are less than 2 hours left in the flight. I originally pushed the service button 1.5 hours prior to the duty-free closing and not one crew member came to my assistance. I then went and flagged down a crew member explaining the fact that I've been waiting for 1.5 hours to have someone bring me duty free. She then left and said that she would return in 15 mins. 15 mins later she came back notifying me that the flight had passed the 2-hour marker and was unable to provide duty-free. So, because it wasn't my fault and yet the crew members for not entertaining to the service call, I have realized how bad Air Canada is and as a Canadian disappointed at the service we offer. Will never be using Air Canada again. Would rather fly with an airline that cares about the travellers.",6th October 2019,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to New Delhi ,Oct-19,1,1,3,4,4,4,1,26
260,had a bad experience,S Haryan,TripVerified,"  Dubai to Toronto. I was travelling with 3 kids and my husband. My 2nd daughter got a bug bite. It is very common for her to get that. It was itchy and she was crying. The lady behind us told the flight attendant that she was hurt. The flight attendant called nurse on board and one nurse came and assisted her. Everything was okay. She didn’t get any medications and slept good. Before reaching Toronto airport, I asked the flight attendant, do we have any procedures to do because of the bug bite? She said, just give your address and she was the one who was doing everything. But, when we went to the gate for boarding to Regina, they said, we are not allowed to travel until we get approval from med- assistant. They send us to the customer service. It was very hard for us because I had to travel with 3 kids and walk all the way to customer service. They all were tired of 2 days of travel. I didn’t get good experience from the person at the customer service. We missed our flight to Regina. We called med- assistant. The med-assistant said, my daughter has to be consulted by on call doctor in air canada. Otherwise, I have to take my kid to a clinic and fill out a 6 page form! But without doing this all, they sent us to Winnipeg. So we had a bad experience in our travel.",4th October 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Toronto,Sep-19,3,2,3,0,1,0,2,27
261,don't recommend Air Canada,Urwah Ahmed,NotVerified," Montreal to Dubai via Toronto. I would like to express my disappointment with Air Canada customer service. I had a flight delay in Montreal, causing me to miss my flight from Toronto to Dubai. Customer service failed to book an alternative flight and they are not responding to my communications through emails, and no one is answering when I am calling on the phone. In Montreal, me and some other passengers were promised a booking for a direct flight from Toronto to Dubai. When we reached Toronto airport, we were surprised that they booked us on British Airways via London with no consideration to the class of booking we had or visa restrictions some might have which was clearly explained by me to their staff in Montreal. The only option was Emirates. Air Canada staff couldn't book us on Emirates with an excuse of no seats available. I booked on Emirates myself, and since then I am sending emails for refunds, and to express my disappointment, with no response and no care for my needs as a customer. I really don't recommend Air Canada, because if you got stuck with the customer service, you will never receive good service, neither help.",3rd October 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Dubai via Toronto,Aug-19,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,27

263,One of the most bland meals,G Faresi,Not Verified,"Ottawa to London. I had ordered the Jain meal, just to see what it was about. It came on a tiny tray with a small container of a few slices of cucumber and tomato, a container of pieces of fruit and a hot container with steamed basmati rice, steamed broccoli and a portion of chick peas. One of the most bland meals I have had. The second round of food was a dry rice cake and fruit. The seats are not very comfortable; they should consider to replace them with the type of seat where the bottom slides forward and the inside of the back changes angle. How does this airline maintain its 4 stars when supposedly inferior airlines offer better food and seats in economy?  Had the meal been better, the rating would have been a 7/10 or 8/10. I will seriously consider connecting in Montreal to access European airlines and avoid Air Canada.",26th September 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to London,Sep-19,3,3,2,5,4,0,3,27

Was on hold for +15 minutes twice. No operator or consultant available. Arrived at the airport 15 minutes before gate closed, informed client manager at the checkin line. Was told to wait my turn. Obviously then missed the flight. The ticketing office offered me a ticket at 3x the original price. For my luggage refund I have to apply online  but that could take weeks. Customer service at the ticketing counter was callous and not interested in their clients. I was in the line there for another 20 minutes. As a consumer I will vote with my wallet.

265,competing to get worse,A Tahim,TripVerified, Toronto to Vancouver. This airline is getting more and more ridiculous by the day. They keep eliminating staff and replacing them with machines. Remaining staff are getting more and more useless. Now they have started charging for one single luggage unless you pay their high fares. If you want to check in your small carry on bag they charge you $30. Limited food options in domestic/North American flights are outrageous for what they are for such low quality and the food in international routes are hardly digestible. In the world that most airlines are competing to get worse Air Canada is one of the top contenders.,23rd September 2019,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Vancouver,Sep-19,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,27

The day I started my journey from Toronto Pearson airport the flight was late by one and half hours and today I am returning to Canada by the same airline and the flight time was at 5:45pm but after reaching to LaGuardia airport suddenly they have change flight departure time to 7pm. And again after one hour, they have changed departure time to 7:30 pm. It is really frustrating and boring. It seems to be the service of this airline is very bad. Above all, I need to pick my car from the park n fly zone. No doubt I am going to lose money due to this delay.

Just got on a flight in which the staff at the check in counter was extremely rude and forced us to check our legally sized carry-on bags. We were part of boarding group 3 and they claimed that the overhead storage was already full. When boarding the plane, we realized that the storage compartments nearly wide open. The remaining 3 groups continued to bring carry-on bags much larger than ours into the main cabin overheads. The flight attendant was appalled that the checking agent forced us to check our bags and she did everything that she could to get our bags up to the main cabin (she was the only competent person that we encountered and deserves a raise). The fact that the checking agents decided to single us out was absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable. Air Canada, you have every opportunity to make the boarding experience pleasant and fair, there is absolutely no excuse for this kind of incompetence.",13th September 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Toronto,Sep-19,2,5,0,2,1,2,1,28

Worst entertainment system, you must watch 5 minutes of ads before doing any of your choice (films, musique or game) you have access  to music compilations with no possibility of selecting a precise artiste or soundtrack.

The seats where very comfy compared to Lufthansa and the in flight entertainment was much better than Lufthansa. Overall the flight went quick because of the great service, food, entertainment and comfort!

The seat was quite uncomfortable and seemed smaller than what I remember on other 787s. The meals were just pathetic,  served in plastic containers and virtually tasteless for me. Choice of pasta or chicken with rice. We had to struggle to tear off the sealed  lid. No drink before the meal. Only plastic bottles of wine or beer on offer with the meal and only one was permitted for me. I was disappointed as I was looking forward to the flight. I hadn’t flown AC internationally for a long time (I live in Bangkok) and usually fly CX. I remember AC international inflight service as being pretty good. What happened?

I was able to get to the gate on time, but ran to be sure. I arrived at the gate, F34, which was still boarding Zone 2, at 18:04. Upon attempting to board, I was informed that I had been moved. The Gate agent was rude and offered exactly no consolation other than the new ticket, which was scheduled to not leave until 21:20; 3 hours later.

She was running down the aisles multiple times in the middle of the 15.5 hour flight and got the attention of one of the flight attendants, Joyce.

The desk staff ""assured"" me that my bag will be delivered the next day however I had to wait for a week for my bag to be given to me. Furthermore, my bag wasn't even delivered to me, I had to make a 3hr trip to the airport to retrieve it on the 19th August paying over $30 for parking. Air Canada assured me that my bag will be delivered to my address in Toronto but they never bothered to send my bag over from Dublin which meant that Aer Lingus, who I must say was one of the only reasons my bag was delivered to me, had to send my bag over. Furthermore, Air Canada knew that my bag was in Toronto but didn't bother to collect it from the Aer Lingus desk until we went to the airport to force them to collect it. All the staff at the airport were unfriendly and didn't want to help us until we called for the baggage manager who finally helped us with our case. When I finally received my bag, it was in a terrible state, there were multiple scratches and scuffs and the wheels were broken. I had no clothes, toiletries or anything for the 1st week in Toronto so I had to go out and buy new clothes and toiletries spending over $200.  The customer service for delayed baggage at Air Canada is next to useless as the calls were directed to an Indian call centre where the people never helped my cause and never apologized for the bag being delayed. The lack of customer service made the situation worse and made me feel like I was treated like rubbish by the airline. As for the actual plane itself, it was an A330-300 which had terrible legroom and an outdated IFE screen with the USB port on my seat not working.

The seat leg room is getting smaller, the fleet is aging, and the airline has consistent staffing issues. I am not sure if the staffing issue is related to the number of people they staff causing burnout in their ranks or poor training, but as a customer it is definitely felt.

We got the TD Aeroplan card  because we were told that the primary card holder gets a free checked bag, so my husband and I got them. No one told us that we only got them free if we booked with aeroplan points, which we didn't this time because we didn't have enough points yet. The Air Canada attendant who told us this information was not very friendly or polite, but I stayed super friendly with the lady the whole way through it all. The lady went and got sheets and pointed out the details. So we had no choice but to pay for the bags. If I had known in advance, we would of left a lot of our stuff at my parents home and only took what fit in our carry on. we would of brought that stuff later when flying home with West Jet where we get 1 free checked bag for myself and everyone else flying with me no matter how we pay for our flights. After paying someone told me that she had the authority to waive the bag fees if she wanted to. After this experience I did not want to fly Air Canada again. But on our last flight from Vancouver to Terrace which was delayed the attendants were amazing, they were full of smiles and super friendly even with all the stress they had of trying to get the plane ready for people who had been waiting a long time. They had great personalities and were great with all the kids on board. Because of them on the last flight, I might decided to fly Air Canada again, but at this point I will book future flights with WestJet where I get free 1st checked bags for myself and anyone flying with me no matter how I pay for my flights. Also I have never had an issue with their service with WestJet. I used to work in customer service and giving super great happy customer services was a big thing for me, so I expect the same when spending my money on service and products. I would of given a 0 rating, but because of our last flight with the super great attendants I wont give it a 0 rating.",25th August 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London (ON) to Toronto,Aug-19,3,3,2,3,1,0,3,29
290,a much better experience,A Kazir,TripVerified,"  London to Toronto and this was a much better experience with Air Canada than the one I enjoyed last Monday and Tuesday, because although my flight back to London in 19th August 2019 was ok the only bad part about the flight was that I sat in the back of the plane and it was the worst place to sit on a plane because of the engines being so loud and felt big turbulence. But, my flight to Toronto on 21st July 2019 was much better because a great part about the flight was that I was originally supposed to sit in 21H aisle seat but they changed it to 21K window seat and it was the best seat I had and the engines were much quieter but on my return flight.",25th August 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Toronto,Jul-19,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,30
291,"No apologies, no explanations",G Edwards,NotVerified,"  MEX-YUL: The flight is operated by Air Canada Rouge. Check In and Boarding Gate staff in MEX is fantastic, polite, courteous and efficient. Legroom is insufficient, I am not tall, and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. No personal entertainment screens, you need to download the app. Food being sold on the plane is mediocre, bring your own snacks. Crew was actually nice and helpful. YUL-YYZ-BOG: Couldn’t check in online or the kiosk, so forced to go to the counters. A very long check in line, 1 agent attending the general line. Since I travelled alone with a small child and quite a lot of baggage, I attempted to use the special assistance line. Immediately confronted by a very rude agent, who barked at me for not standing in the right place. All she had to do was move me 1 meter to the families check in, but in her very rude and arrogant way she sent me to the check in entrance. Was attended by another agent who was very rude and arrogant. Apparently, my flight was cancelled, I had to stay 24 hrs. in Montreal. No apologies, no explanations, just rude and condescending attitude. No effort to accommodate me on another flight. Next day: Again, could not use the kiosk, had to use the check in counters. Ground staff in YUL is rude, slow, inefficient, the agent attending families was taking passengers from the general line. Flight YYZ-BOG: Crew was nice and friendly, but the airplane is old, dirty, worn out seats, no inflight entertainment. Altogether, I would spend my money elsewhere.",24th August 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to Montreal via Bogota,Aug-19,1,4,1,1,1,3,1,30
292,Seat is extremely hard,V Lear,TripVerified,"  
Seoul to Toronto. Photogenic but uncomfortable! Air Canada Business Class is probably the worst of the herringbone configuration designs. Seat is extremely hard and the space between the bed and the table is very limited, almost impossible to turn without hitting the table with your knees when in the sleeping position. AC does not provide pajamas and their amenity kit is so cheap. ",24th August 2019,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Seoul to Toronto,Aug-19,1,3,2,4,2,0,1,30
293,this used to be a reputable airline,Karin Menan,TripVerified,"  I used this airline for return flights to Toronto and from Havana to Montreal. Even for 5 hour flights, this airline does not serve food or alcoholic drinks. The seats are narrow and there is not much legroom. Also, the web checkin site (3rd August 2019) did not work for the 24 hours prior to the flight. I then called the customer services and, twice, had to wait for almost an hour before someone took my call before telling me that he could not help me at all. Worst of all, from Toronto, August 3rd 2019, my flight was delayed by more than 2.5 hrs. Air Canada did not inform me, infact, their web page still showed the original time as being 'on time'. A service called tripcase informed me about the delay. At the airport, the check in machines did nit work either. Many years ago this used to be a reputable airline. Not any longer, it seems. There are other choices, fortunately.",24th August 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Toronto,Jul-19,2,3,1,2,2,0,1,30

I am without clothes for 6 days and they are careless. I flew from Madrid to Toronto on the 14th August. Before I leave I asked Air Canada about my bag, they told my they have it, but it wont be on the same flight, it will arrive tomorrow. When I arrived to Toronto, I informed Air Canada about it again, they registered it in the system & told me it will be delivered in 24 hours. It didn’t arrive.

295,Air Canada had terminated the Toronto to Delhi route,C Harper,TripVerified," On 2/3/19, I purchased a one layover trip with Air Canada to Delhi, India (round trip route: 7/21: DC-Toronto-Delhi 8/5: Delhi-Toronto-DC). However, 10 days before our departure day (7/12), I received an email letting me know that my flight schedule had changed. After speaking with a representative I was informed that Air Canada had terminated the Toronto to Delhi route and that I would have to be placed on different flights in order for me to reach my destination at the dates I had initially selected. After a few back and forths, I was able to be placed on a two layover journey to India, with the following route: 7/21: DC-Montreal-Munich-Delhi, 8/5: Delhi-Vancouver-Toronto-DC. As a result of this change, my initial one layover ~18h trip turned into a two layover ~26h voyage. Additionally, when booking my trip, I was asked to select and pay for my seats, as the seats were not free of charge. Once I had boarded, I realized that I had not been assigned to the seats I purchased. I contacted Air Canada about this but never received a reply. On August 4, 2019 (one day before the return flight), I received a text message from Air Canada letting me know that the AC45 return flight on 8/5 would be departing at 5.55am (although the return flight I had initially been placed on was scheduled to leave at 7.40am). Over the course of my return, the boarding gate for two out of the three flights were changed shortly before boarding, resulting in a delay for one of the flights.",21st August 2019,Solo Leisure,First Class,Reagan to Delhi ,Aug-19,3,3,3,3,3,0,1,30
296,the best business class seat,Malcolm Norton,TripVerified,"  London to Toronto via Halifax. It's definitely not the old AC business class. No drinks order before take-off,  no champagne offered only mimosa, maybe time of day. Meals delivered automaton by most of the crew (a couple stood out for warmth) but I have to say the London kitchens came through again for vegan with a delicious chick pea curry, mushrooms, steamed spinach and baked tomato. The Toronto AC kitchens should take note as mostly appalling idea of vegan food served from them. I had the croissant, I know not vegan but worth the stray. Other than meal service crew were scarce. 60 minutes after take off and no drink or crew member seen. I had to press the call button after a couple of hours to order some red wine, no top up after the meals at all. Still the best business class seat in North America and though entertainment was pretty mediocre compared to years ago I managed to find something on HBO to keep me hooked the whole flight.",20th August 2019,Family Leisure,Business Class,London to Toronto via Halifax,Aug-19,4,3,5,4,3,0,3,30
297,mess of a boarding process,H Smith,TripVerified,  London to Toronto. A 2 hour delay for unexplained scheduling issues (no other delayed flights at LHR). Complete mess of a boarding process meant the whole thing turned into a melee. The policy of 2 carry on bags meant that we wasted 20 minutes trying to find space for everyone’s hand luggage. Also an old plane which hadn’t been fully cleaned.,16th August 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Toronto,Aug-19,2,2,0,3,1,0,2,30
298,inside left a lot to be desired,B Larson,TripVerified,"  Flew Montreal Dublin on one of their new A330. Brand new paint job on the outside but the inside left a lot to be desired. Faulty recline, old seats, wonky tray tables, very dated and tatty cabin. Entertainment screens failed before they started, crew had no idea what to do. Not a big deal as these things happen and crew handed out coupons. A week later the return flight, same plane and the gate attendants tell us the entertainment systems still not working. What are you playing at air Canada? Why are you sending defective aircraft on transatlantic flights, really not on, you had a week to fix it.  The 1 in this rating is for the cabin crew who were good.

299,not a sufficient time to transfer,M Lorga,NotVerified,"  I have purchased Air Canada ticket at a higher price in order to get a shorter connection time. Instead I got delayed 1 hr from Milan to Toronto and 2.5 hrs from Toronto to Montreal. When I asked the customer service why I could not make an earlier flight from Toronto to Montreal I was told that 1.5 hrs was not a sufficient time to transfer the baggage. It looks like 1.5 hrs min was enough for baggage transfer when I paid for my initial itinerary, at least thats how it was presented.",14th August 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Montreal via Toronto,Aug-19,2,2,0,0,1,0,2,30

First from Toronto to Montreal because the captain was late then because some of the crew was late. Waited 2h in the plane without moving. Coming back from Montreal to toronto delayed again, over an hour waiting in the plane. Captain makes an announcement apologizing for delay but they are still waiting for passengers supposed to be on the plane. I guess next time I can sleep in and Air Canada will park the plane and wait for me. Never flew aircanada and not had an issue to I would definitely suggest staying away if possible.

302,No vegetarian option,Mark Steel,NotVerified,"  Toronto to London. Boeing 787, so ok aircraft. Premium economy so bigger seats. Onboard staff don’t know how to smile. Only small glass of orange juice or water in premium econ (compared to virgin where you get Prosecco). Food really odd. A breakfast omelette with fried potatoes and creme freche - on a 7hr flight 9am to 9pm Toronto to LHR. Followed by a turkey and cheese rol. No vegetarian option without booking ahead, and a breakfast followed by snack on a 7hr flight? No lunch.

303,flight was not one of the best,Martin Read,TripVerified," Toronto to Rome. Excellent Check In process in dedicated area, our Oversize luggage was handled efficiently. Maple Leaf Lounge lacked European Newspapers and was tired. Efficient Boarding process, no welcome drinks or attention prior to take off (The Purser told be she had a late arriving Commissary and was struggling to Board 450 passengers hence no service in Business Class prior to take off). Comfortable Lie Flat Seats, Good selection of Wine & Champagne. Dinner was acceptable but poorly presented. Excellent Breakfast with a freshly cooked Omelette. Service was courteous and efficient but lacked charm and it really seemed that the Cabin Crew were just going through the motions. On Time departure and arrival.

304,how I can get my bag back?,S Kayder,TripVerified,"  La Guardia to Dublin via Toronto. When I checked in to my flight, I already knew I would miss my connection with them so I asked them to make sure they do not lose my bags (the flight was delayed due to weather). When I reached my gate, I asked the agent to check my connection and she said I came too late to her because there are no more flights to my final destination the next two days. I have been delayed and missed my connection on many airlines but none were as disorganized as this. The first leg of my flight was New York to Toronto. In Toronto, my bag was already lost. I reached there 2 am and the lady did not file a claim when I told her my bag was lost and rather told me to return the next day to find it.The next day I returned to find it 4 hours before my next flight and they still did not find it in time for the bag to make my connection. They told me to file a claim when I reached my final destination but AC was very dismissive here at my final destination of Izmir in Turkey and did not allow me to file a claim with them. When I tried to file a claim online, I needed a incident report number, but since no one ever filed a claim for me, I never received an incident number. On the phone they were very unhelpful and rude. First of all I had to wait 21 minutes to even get an agent and then they told me to just file a ""lost and found item"".

Staff were very friendly and spoke multiple languages. IFE had an ok selection. Food was good at times.

307,handled situation very poorly,T Markan,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Philadelphia flight never happened because of bad weather. We flew in from Calgary and should be connected at Toronto-Pearson to Philadelphia. But they changed our gate twice, then announced our flight is cancelled without giving us instruction what going to happen next. Then we asked them they sent us to the Air Canada info desk which the representative stated “there is nothing they can do at the moment bc all flights are going to Philadelphia because of bad weather. They took us to a private hallway and handed us refund info card. And told us our baggage will be at claim 10. Baggage took 1.5 hours to get out. They automatically booked us for the next afternoon flight. Then again, canceled that and rebooked is for two day later flights. Nobody contact us for any help. We were left stranded there and had to find our means to get out to Toronto. Work loss. Time wasted over the phone. Air Canada handled this situation very poorly and irresponsible. The weather in Philadelphia wasn’t bad as they were telling us. Our friends and family in Philadelphia were confused bc the weather was fine. We are never going to fly Air Canada again.

310,had to wait hours in Toronto,V Stanikova,TripVerified,"  Prague to Toronto where I was supposed to continue on flight to Washington DC at 2pm. With me I only had a carry on luggage which I took with me on board. I was trying to find a place to store my luggage and one steward told me he will take care of it. That was really nice of him. Then he asked me if I had any important stuff in there, so I took my documents I had from school and he left with the luggage again. Then I learned my suitcase was checked in with the rest of the checked suitcases when they gave me the luggage number. So I told them that I’m going all the way to DC and they told me they have no idea if the suitcase is going all the way to DC or not and that I should ask some employees on the airport what is about to happen with the suitcase. I had no idea my suitcase is being checked in the plane storage. So there was nothing I could do about it afterwards. When I got out of the plane in Toronto I have asked about five people and every single one of the told me a different information. Nevertheless later they told me they lost the suitcase and couldn’t find it. And nobody was able to give me a proper information. All I was hearing was “I don’t know” and people there were not actually trying to help me, which is really frustrating when you’re supposed to catch a connecting flight which obviously I did not catch. When they finally found my suitcase I was told I can join the next flight to DC. But since I haven’t had my carry on suitcase with me because it was checked in  I had to wait hours in Toronto for a flight at 8:50pm which was delayed for 90 minutes.

313,This is not an isolated incident,Kelsey Nicholson,NotVerified,"  I had an awful experience with Air Canada on my recent trip to Europe. Every single flight on my trip was delayed, but that was the least of my worries. On my way there, my bag was lost. I was unable to contact anyone who could give me any information as to where it was. When I received it nearly 3 days later it was severely damaged. On the way home I had even more troubles. Due to substantial delays, I missed my connecting flight in Montreal and had to stay there for an extra day before I could get another flight home. I was denied any compensation for a hotel room, cab fare, or food while I was stuck unexpectedly in Montreal for an extra day. They gave me a phone number to call to get a hotel room at a ""discounted rate"". However when I finally got through, I was told there were no more discounted rates left and the best they could offer me was a $300 room at the Marriott. No thanks. I booked my own hotel room for half the price on Expedia instead. When I finally got home the next day do you think my bag made it home too? Of course not! Once again it was delayed and further damaged. I have also been denied my claim for a refund of baggage fees, so I guess I paid $60+ each way for the privilege of having my bag lost and destroyed. It has been impossible to get ahold of an actual person to talk to about this nightmare of a trip, and all of my online claims have been denied. I have received $0 in compensation for any of this, even though I spent hundreds of extra dollars as a result of Air Canada's incompetence. My friends who were also flying Air Canada (different flights) to attend the same wedding all had similar troubles as well. This is not an isolated incident.

It was an awesome flight with Air Canada because when I checked in, my seat was originally 21H but the lady at the airport changed my seat to 21K which is the window seat and I sat next to the wing.  When I boarded, I went to meet the pilot and they were such gentlemen. It was also been such a long time I took a 777 Flight.

316,Zero customer service,D Murphy,TripVerified,"  Toronto to LaGuardia. Our flight was cancelled due to thunderstorms which is completely out of Air Canada’s control. However, the way they dealt with this situation was terrible. Zero customer service. Sitting on a hot plane for 3 hours. Flight cancelled and told to go to level 3 Desk 2. Wait 45 mins in a line, nothing. Told go to Desk 12, then told go to desk 15. 3 hours of additional inconvenience. No hotel voucher, no refund and stranded in Toronto for the night. Air Canada have a high flight cancel rate, so why not have a system in place for these situations? Also, on our flight to Toronto, they did not know who was on the plane. Calling passengers names over intercom on plane before take off to confirm they were in fact on board.  If people are on the plane that you are not aware of, they is unacceptable.

317,wait in airport a total of 8 hours,Diane Anderson,TripVerified," Connection flight from Victoria to Vancouver rescheduled (delayed 3 three times) so would miss connecting Air Canada flight to SFO. Landed with 10 min to run to gate. Had to go thru customs. Missed the flight at 1.30. They bumped us to a 7.30 pm flight. There were 2 earlier flights for which we asked to be on standby. There were others on our flight who made it onboard an earlier flight. We were never called for boarding pass. Went to gate counter several times. They had seats on the 4.30 flight which 2 hours earlier they said there would not be any problem getting on - lots of seats. So they loaded everyone on and had seats in all categories but would not give us any, including paying for upgrade to first class. They said there just wasn't time to get us our boarding pass. They offered only a $10 food coupon per person. All due to scheduling issues on behalf of Air Canada - which a frequent flyer at the time said (too late) happens all the time. The supervisor would not give us a refund so we could fly another airline to get home before 3.00 am. So had to wait in airport a total of 8 hours because of their repeated scheduling errors.

319,failed to provide meaningful compensation,S Dean,TripVerified,"  We booked and paid the higher prices for a direct flight taking 5.5 hours and departing early afternoon from Heathrow to St Johns, Newfoundland. Air Canada later cancelled the flight (for an appropriate reason), rescheduled us onto an indirect flight via Toronto taking over 13 hours and requiring a 4am departure from home with young children, but have failed to provide any meaningful compensation. E-mails to Customer Services (which have been the only way to contact them) have resulted in rude, unprofessional responses. We want to complain not only about compensation, but also about the attitude of Customer Services. However, they don’t seem to publish their Complaints Procedure anywhere. Therefore, nearly 6 weeks ago, I e-mailed to ask what their complaints procedure is if unhappy with the response from Customer Services – they have not responded. I  thought Air Canada would be a professional, well-run business with competent, trained, efficient staff. In our experience, nothing could be further from the truth.

320,I had an excellent flight,M Deane,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Vancouver. I had an excellent flight with Air Canada last week. The 777-LR with the pods and AC's Signature service is wonderful. The staff were attentive and friendly. I had the beef and the salad, dessert and cheese with a glass of wine were memorable. I flew on their latitude fare (which is full fare economy) and they gave me an up-grade from economy to a seat in the front cabin. My advice is if you fly several times a year fly with the same carrier or alliance because they notice and treat you like gold. One can look for a lower cost fare. However, as a tall guy I really appreciate the service and the big seat and it was very comfy. Also, the IFE was excellent. The AC wide body planes have an excellent number of choices and the front cabin has very large screens. I watched two films and hopefully when I fly AC again I can watch the other half of the third film I was watching. I appreciate that they have 'classic' films because the recent films are not necessarily my first choice.",15th July 2019,Family Leisure,Business Class,Toronto to Vancouver,Jul-19,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,33

322,remained unhelpful throughout,Catherine Spencer,TripVerified," We had a connection flight from Victoria to London that stopped in Vancouver, with only a 1h10min stop over which had been arranged by the airline through the Air Canada website - we are experienced flyers and had we been able to we would have booked ourselves on the 16:00h flight rather than the 18:00h flight that we ended up on. The first flight from Victoria was delayed by half an hour which mean that we had even less time to get between the flights and we knew Vancouver airport was rather large. The flight was then delayed again meaning that even though it was supposed to take off at 18:30 actually took off at 20:05, which was 5 mins before our next flight was supposed to take off. There were 16 other people on the same flight with us that were also told that they were going to try and get Vancouver to hold the flight for us as there were already many delays in Vancouver. However, the flight was not held for us and did in fact take off earlier than it was supposed to at 20:05. We missed the flight and expected some compensation as it meant that our entire journey had been delayed by a full day as the only flight they could get us on was for the evening after, and Air Canada did not even provide any hotels for us, despite them being the cause of a 24h delay. As well as this, we had paid money to be put in the preferred seating with extra legroom and when we brought this up while they were booking us on the next flight they were unable to do anything to help us. We understand that other people would have booked the same seats we did and they would be unable to change this, but even after several conversations with the customer ""service"" for the airline asking if they could possibly upgrade us to premium economy as we had paid for more room which we were now not getting, and been delayed by their incompetence, but they remained unhelpful throughout the whole process. Overall, although the individual employees were trying their best to help us, the airline as a whole was awful at helping us and made the journey very difficult as it was in fact them selling us the tickets with only an hour in between that lead to the problems we face.",13th July 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Victoria to London via Vancouver,Jul-19,2,5,3,3,1,0,1,33

Now the 6:00 pm flight will not leave before 7:00 pm, the toilets are not flushing, so the pilot tells us we can go at the airport.

324,This flight was amazing,Ryan Moroso,NotVerified,"  Chicago to Montreal. This flight was amazing. The only problem we had was the long 4 hour delay but that was due to the very poor weather in Chicago. When we boarded everything was clean. We were met by an AMAZING flight attendant, sadly I forgot her name. When we sat down we noticed that there were IFE screens, on a regional jet. The only problem with those was that they were a bit unresponsive. When we got up in the air there was only a drink service but if you wanted you could have purchased a voucher for the buy on board menu or you could have just bought it from the menu. Card only! There was a limited selection due to there being no ovens on the Embraer aircraft but I opted for the chicken noodle soup. Sadly they had run out so I had oatmeal instead. Other than that it was a smooth flight. The bags were on the carousel when we got there and we were gone.",9th July 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Montreal,Jun-19,3,5,5,4,2,0,3,33
325,no communication at all,Duncan Kendall,TripVerified,"  Montreal to Vancouver . There was a lighting storm that stopped most flight on the day, and it was a public holiday, jazz festival and a Sunday that can't be helped and meant all could not be put up in a motel. The problem was that there was no communication at all to tired and stressed travellers. They were able to organise security to subdue travellers, when official announcements and communications should have been priority. This came 3 hours after, too late and baggage was not delivered until 5 hours after so nobody could really leave anyhow. Cabin staff were short and rude on the eventual flight after anyhow, when many had been sleeping at the airport for 28 hours.",9th July 2019,Business,Economy Class,Montreal to Vancouver ,Jun-19,3,1,3,4,1,4,1,33

Air Canada lost our luggage on both flights ways and couldn't tell when it would be delivered. I fly regularly for business 20-30 times year and have had my luggage lost once in the last five years.

329,vowed I would never fly with Air Canada again,B Davidson,TripVerified," OK so I’m getting senile. Back in 1972 I vowed I would never fly with Air Canada again but, stupidly, this year I decided to use them on a short sector. I received, shortly before I left for the airport, a text message telling me not to forget my flight, to Halifax, so I went to the airport. When I went to check in, and before the woman who was handling the desk I was going to use, could say anything, her next-door colleague announced in a loud voice that the flight had been cancelled. As the aircraft was to come from Halifax, some 2 hours away, someone should have told the computer to send me a message telling me that. This is where Air Canada customer handling came to the fore – come back at 20.30 and we will get you on that flight. I explained I had 3 more connections that day. Whilst one of the two check-in staff made an effort to sort out the problem the other indicated she could not care less about our problem. Due to that I had to pay full fare on WestJet for both my wife and self. It should be said the contrast could not have been greater the check-in lady to whom I spoke bent over backwards to help us – Thank you WestJet! I have told my wife if I even think of Air Canada again to have me certified.",6th July 2019,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,St. John's to Halifax ,Jun-19,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,33
330,Well done again AC,M Galler,TripVerified, My flight from Montreal to Vienna was delayed and wasn't going to be leaving until the following morning. This caused me to miss my bus from Vienna to Munich which cost over 100 euros. I spent 9 hours in the airport waiting. They didn't do anything but give me a coupon to use with Air Canada. I'm never going to use it as I never want to fly Air Canada again. I'm now on my way home from Vienna and my flights been delayed an hour and a half causing me to miss another ride so I will have to get a hotel for the night in Vancouver as I live 2 hours drive from the airport.

331,flight was cancelled,U Elkins,TripVerified, Barcelona to Vancouver via Montreal. My dad was supposed to be home yesterday but his flight was cancelled and he had to spend the night at the airport. The phone lines had very long holds of over and 90 minutes if you could actually get through. After waiting an hour and a half on hold my mom was disconnected. Rather than teaching staff how to deal with tired and frustrated people waiting they simply sent in armed security guard and threatened to arrest anyone who was rude to Air Canada staff.

333,delayed 7 hours in total,L Gordon,TripVerified, I used them twice - from Chicago to Toronto and back. I will never use it again. We were delayed 7 hours in total. Once it was because of ‘weather’ but the next was delayed 3h 45min because they were trying to get overbooked clients to cancel their flight.

334,only check baggage two hours prior,C Dean,TripVerified,  Dallas to Vancouver. A horrible experience. They will only check baggage two hours prior to the time for boarding.

So I called to verify if I could fly with my naturalization certificate and I was told by a customer service supervisor that I could. When I got to airport they said I couldn’t.

Our bag was lost or sent with a different flight we don’t know yet. They booked us into a hotel but gave us the address of another one and we had to find a way to get to the correct address at 2 AM! The customer service rolled their eyes at us, hang up the phone, told us no one will do anything at this point and they were more interested in going home then assisting.

337,Our baggage was not delivered,A Badeer,TripVerified,"  Victoria to Boston via Montreal. Very poor interpersonal experience. Aircraft, facility etc are reasonable. It is the behaviour of staff that cause concerns. In food delivery service, the hostess decided to skip several rows, and when called for a drink, she pointed to the fact that we should have asked when they were delivering drinks! Our baggage was not delivered, The agent linked to US customs looked it up and found that it was delivered to another airport. He advised that we should contact the Baggage agent. The comment we received from the baggage agent were disturbing ""are you sure it was not delivered?"".

Every time I book a flight I get pre assigned a middle seat and zone 6 for last to board. There was no overhead luggage space because everyone carries huge rolling luggage pieces. I book and pay for extra leg room only to have them move someone into seat beside me who didn’t pay at all.

340,seatbelts don’t work with car seats,Lee Raphael,TripVerified,"  Los Angeles to Toronto. We booked 4 Business Class Seats on their Boeing 787 for a red eye flight. The tickets were for me, my wife, our 13-month daughter and our 14-year old niece. Air Canada booking showed the age of our daughter, as we gave them her info and said we wanted a seat for her. After we boarded, and put her in her car seat, she fell right asleep as people were still boarding.  At this point the crew said the car seat needed to be checked as their seatbelts don’t work with car seats, and I had to hold her. They also said there were no seats in coach for her and that they need me to get her now so that they could take off. They were polite, but I was stunned by what I was being told.  We complied with their instructions, as required. Air Canada responded to my email offering me a $100 e-gift card. All of us were exhausted after the flight. I’m insulted by their offer of $100 and simply can’t believe any airline would act in such a manner. ",23rd June 2019,Family Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to Toronto,Jun-19,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,35

342,Shameful performance,M LaPrairie,TripVerified," CMN-DCA via YUL in business class. The CMN-YUL flight was an hour late departing which made the connection tight in YUL for the short segment to DCA. Crew on board the long over-the-water sector was excellent. Very friendly and attentive. Food was very good. AC uses the old herringbone 1-2-1 business class configuration. It is private, but does not allow you to look out the window. While transiting in Montreal, I could see that my bag cleared US Customs. However, it did not make it onto the aircraft for the short flight to Washington Reagan. Upon arrival, I filed a missing baggage claim with AC. This is done at their check-in counter and, as a result, took a long time as a large family checking in had a problem with their tickets and there was only one agent on duty. I finally was able to file a claim. My bag arrived on the same flight a day later, even though there was six flights between Montreal and Washington (either DCA or IAD) in the interim. After arriving in Washington, my bag took another 24 hours to get to me. Shameful performance on the part of AC's baggage tracing and contracted courier delivery service.

Air Canada made changes to my itinerary three times without explanation. The first time around I called Air Canada directly but was told I needed to contact Expedia. Expedia was helpful but had no explanation for the changes. I had to make changes to my other connecting flights every time Air Canada made a change. On the day of travel, during check-in the agent did not understand e-visas to India and asked for clarifications from me. I found the onboard food choices and quality below par. They lost one of our bags when we landed in Delhi and the agents there did not have a clue as to what happened. We are keeping our fingers crossed, and are hoping to get the bag back in time for the wedding I came to India for.

When they reach Delhi for transfer for their Air India flight charged extra fees for the baggage. On top of it though it is an international transfer they are considering as a domestic trip.

This Air Canada flight was very comfortable, along with nice food services ( a cup noodle, bread, and the main dish) served in three times and definitely lessens the pressure during the 12h long haul in Economy.

350,was the most uncomfortable,R Carson,TripVerified,"  London to Vancouver. Air Canada have only one Boeing 777 seat configuration for short haul and long haul - 3-4-3. Most of my travel is, and has been, long haul with many airlines. This at 9 hrs was the most uncomfortable in Economy of any of my previous Economy flights. The constant brushing of shoulders with fellow passengers and crew - seated next to one and as they travel along the aisles (I was seated in an aisle seat) leads to surly crew and intolerant passengers - not a pleasant flight. I flew this flight because of the cost savings against the alternatives - but after the flight can only state that the savings (perhaps $100 each way) were not worth the bad experience for 9 hours.

There was a bistro cart for paying customers and I got a packet of fruit slices, cheese and crackers: the fruit was turning soft and the moisture frorm the fruit made the cheese soggy. There was nothing in the booking process or ticket that signalled that a meal was not included, otherwise I would have brought my own.

I took my passport mistakenly thinking I was done and began to walk onto the plane. She took off running and saying I hadn’t been checked yet and “what do you think you’re doing?! You can’t just walk on the plane!” Everyone thinks she was overreacting to try make a scene. Then after everyone is sitting we had to get off the airplane for mechanical issues.

354,seldom had a more attentive crew,W Robert Kmen,TripVerified,"  Zurich to Toronto. This was the penultimate leg of a business class odyssey through Asia. It was the most impressive of six segments. Air Canada configures their 787 business class cabin 1-2-1, which is considerably more comfortable than United's 2-2-2. The downside to AC's arrangement is that you have to stretch and contort in order to see out the window. The flight was about 95% full, with the business class cabin at 100%. I have seldom, if ever, had a more attentive crew. Between meal services, there was always at least one attendant patroling the cabin eager to serve. The Thai chicken curry was excellent - and I had just spent four days in Bangkok. I hope Air Canada management reads these reviews, because they can be quite pleased with all aspects of this long-haul service.",22nd May 2019,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Zurich to Toronto,May-19,5,5,5,4,5,1,5,36
355,flight from hell,Nadine Jones,NotVerified," Calgary to Belize City via Toronto. I had a flight from hell. It started from Calgary when a storm hit which I can understand when flights are canceled it can’t be helped. But then I couldn’t get another flight cause there was no one working and thousands of people trying to rebook. Finally, at around 3 am I got someone after waiting in line for hours to rebook. But when I went to check in I was told there was no such flight or booking under that number. So then they wanted to send me to Toronto then El Salvador for the night, I wasn’t happy with that so they sent me to Miami then Belize. So instead of me getting to Belize on the 28th I finally got there on the 30th. Up until getting to Miami, I hadn’t slept for some 30+ hours. After finding a gentleman, the only one, with Air Canada he finally got me a room for the night. Now I’m on my way home and in Houston for a 12-hour layover before I board for Calgary.",20th May 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Belize City via Toronto,May-19,3,4,2,3,1,3,1,36
356,improved their long haul product,A Wong,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Hong Kong. A trip riddled with personal hiccups, but Air Canada managed to make it feel better. I was running a little late for my flight and in the heat of it all, left one of my carry-ons at a security checkpoint for domestic departures. While I wasn’t able to get the item back the ground staff and cabin crew went above and beyond their fall of duty in helping me get it back. It didn’t work out in the end, but I appreciate the effort from contact numbers to the flight attendant that literally stepped off the plane to help me look. They really didn’t have to, but I am very thankful for their efforts. As for the premium economy cabin itself, it’s very small, comprising of 3 rows, totalling 24 seats. They’re significantly wider than economy seats and closely resemble the regional business class product. The seats were comfortable and I managed to catch 6 hours of sleep on a 14 hour flight, but they a cosmetic refresh may be due, with slightly warped armrests and scratched glossy plastic seatbacks negatively impacting the aesthetics. IFE was touchscreen and remote controlled, though the touchscreen functions were somewhat unwieldy compared to economy class TVs. Food was above average, with a premium (though not business class worthy) first meal with proper porcelain and metal cutlery, followed by what seemed to be a standard economy class meal (I believe Cathay Pacific also does the same thing). They also have a chicken pesto ciabatta as a snack prior to landing and that was good too, chicken was tender and well seasoned. I would also note that typical of a North American airline, Air Canada does offer good coffee (Lavazza) even in regular economy, so that’s a plus. Overall, Air Canada has drastically improved their long haul product over the years, while maintaining fairly reasonable fares for international flights. As a full service airline, flying to Hong Kong, their most comparable competitor for the route is Cathay Pacific, of whom I have referenced regularly. Given a choice between the two, I would pick Air Canada for value, and surprisingly, food as well- they’re generally much cheaper and there seems to be better attention to detail with regards to food and beverage. On the other hand Cathay is still able to offer more convenient time slots and premium economy in their flights includes 3 checked bags, though typically at a significantly higher price, so who you do fly with definitely depends on your needs, but Air Canada is definitely a viable option to get you there.",16th May 2019,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Vancouver to Hong Kong,May-19,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,36

358,expectations were set low,W Pearce,TripVerified," It was a typical Air Canada flight and expectations were set low, accordingly. Priority boarding was a mess. The flight had only a few people, and the extra seats were appreciated. Half-way through the flight, the entertainment system froze when I tried to look at the map. I could freeze the other two systems next to me by trying to look at the map.  There were random announcements on the PA system of the results of some ongoing basketball game, which was the last thing I was interested in.",15th May 2019,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Los Angeles,May-19,2,1,1,1,1,0,1,36

360,flight was pretty decent,Krishnan Srinivas,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Munich. The flight was pretty decent. Clean cabin and washrooms, excellent crew. I could sleep well due to a decent amount of legroom. Only thing is the food could improve. The meal service is not that generous compared to other full service carriers. I ordered an Asian Vegetarian meal which is ideally Indian and they gave some Aloo gobi (an Indian dish of cooked potatoes and cauliflower) and rice, which is not really a good combination. On top of that it was with sweet potato make it taste even worse. The light snack service of a muffin was filling before landing. IFE was decent. It would be better if they could at least provide eye shades so that passengers can at least sleep well. They keep the cabin lights on for a very long time.",13th May 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Munich,May-19,4,5,3,3,4,0,4,37
361,Worst experience with airline ever,Mike Poll,TripVerified," Worst experience with airline ever: spent extra on business to get some sleep on Dreamliner red eye flight. They replaced Dreamliner with A321 with poor “business class”, uncomfortable seats. To top it all, aircraft has a problem and we most likely will miss connection! Just recalled a few years ago, my Air Canada flight from Toronto to Frankfurt returned back from almost Mid-Atlantic to Halifax due to an issue with the aircraft. Never again Air Canada.

They say no way unless I pay an additional US$150. I refuse. I have no choice most of the time but to use this airline. Air Canada do not care about their loyal customers. Just think about how they will treat new ones. After this experience, I will go out of my way to choose any airline other than Air Canada.

I will be forever thankful for his help, because I see my beautiful daughter only once/year and way to go Air Canada thank you for your excellent service and free meals.

365,unexpected upgrade to business,Bobby Giannakopoulos,TripVerified,"  Montreal to Tokyo-Narita with one of it's most recent aircraft, the Boeing 787. The staff at the boarding gate was proactive by checking bigger carry-ons in order to have enough space on board to accomodate the passengers who had carry-ons that complied with the sizes. The boarding was effective and the flight left on time and arrived in advance. Initially I had a seat in Premium Economy but I got an unexpected upgrade to business class at the end of the boarding which made my flight more enjoyable. The crew and the service was good. Some flight attendants were awesome and funny. The business class seat was a lie flat bed which was amazing and comfortable. The inflight entertainment worked fine and had a good choice of recent movies from many countries. The return leg was from Shanghai and again it was in business class. The service was and crew was once again good. I ended up sleeping during most the flight. Overall Air Canada has a great business class product for the long haul flights.

We had a terrible day before after 7 hours back and forth in a plane in Calgary. Eventually canceled. Air Canada cannot be reached by phone. The agents in the airport could not help, because they say that you have to call. Eventually we were rebooked the following day. You would expect the saga stops but it does not. Air Canada agents seem immune to complaints about delays. Again 3 hours delay for no obvious reasonable reason. They say the airplane is here but it has to be towed from the hangar. Which they suppose to do prior and to be ready. I fly around four times a year. 50% of my flights with Air Canada were delayed beyond 30 minutes.",30th April 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to London,Apr-19,2,2,1,4,1,1,1,37

Check In at the airport was well organized and I enjoyed spending several hours in the Air Canada lounge. The food and wine was excellent and I got a fair amount of work done and enjoyed doing some reading. The Boeng 787is a beautiful plane. The business class seating is generous and comfortable. I particularly like the large screen and the choices with AC's IFE. The staff were friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the food (chose the beef and enjoyed the smoked salmon), dessert and appreciated the choice in wines. I recognize one of the attendants from a flight to Mexico and we had several nice chats. Also, the Chief Flight Attendant took time to speak with the passengers in the cabin. I've decided to go for another trip to New York City. It's just wonderful to be able to fly there non-stop in a beautiful plane like the Boeing 787.",30th April 2019,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Vancouver,Apr-19,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,37

376,failure to address my emails,Steven Johnston,TripVerified,"  Edmonton to Charlotte via Toronto. It started with the grounding of the 737 Max 8 which lead to the first cancellation of my flights on March 15. This is understandable. I went online and changed all of my flights and my wife's flights and lost a day of travel but had everything sorted. I was now due to depart on the 16th. I got a call on the 15th from an agent saying my new flight was cancelled due to a schedule change. I questioned the reason ""schedule change"" as the agent didn't realize my wife was on the same plane and my wife's ticket was still good.  Everything got rebooked to have us routed through Vancouver and then overnighting now in Toronto and arriving the following day in Charlotte. When I arrived in Vancouver I got a text that my plane to Toronto was cancelled and I wasn't departing Vancouver until 11:55pm to Toronto with a 1 hour gap between my arrival and the flight to Charlotte. This was a problem as my luggage was all tagged to Toronto as I was supposed to be getting off and collecting my bags. I went to luggage services and arranged for the bags to all be redirected to Charlotte. I was assured this happened. When I arrived in Toronto I was met with the news that 2 out of 3 of my bags were not located. They almost did not let me board to the US with missing luggage but we finally got through with 4 minutes to spare and a very long run across the airport. I had to purchase new clothes as my bags were missing for three days. I finally got my bags but had to keep calling them to check on them and had to report the issue three different times as they failed to file a proper file number. I was never given the file number and I am now struggling to claim these charges. Due to the three flight cancellations I incurred charges for two missed hotel stays that couldn't be cancelled. We had a great time in Charlotte and on the last day I checked in online for my flight and it said to arrive at the airport 3 hours early for the international flight so we did. When we arrived at the airport there is only one Air Canada counter and there were no staff present to check our bags. We waited for 45 minutes after having the airport page them for someone to show up. When the agent finally showed up and we questioned why we have to be here three hours before our flight but she wasn't here, her response was ""My schedule says I start at 9 take it up with my boss"". There is a sign on the counter that says an agent will only be present 3 hours before flight departure times which clearly was not the case. I emailed air Canada customer service twice regarding these issues and the first response was a generic canned response addressing the grounding of the Max 8 737, which did not address my concerns. I noticed through my trip, no matter the issue they were using that as the reason for everything. I originally asked for someone to call me which has still not happened and I have written a reply to their email which they have not responded to. There were multiple opportunities available for the airline to step up and do something such as hotel vouchers during layovers etc. but they did nothing and the failure to address my emails with a legitimate response is disgraceful.",5th April 2019,Business,Economy Class,Edmonton to Charlotte via Toronto,Mar-19,4,4,0,4,1,0,1,38

He was lovely chatting and after a while I was able to go back to my seat and finish the flight. This was a unique experience for me but Damion made it seem as though this sort of thing happens all the time.

382,48 hours in  Canadian airports,Kale Tyler,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Samana. After booking my honeymoon at a 5 star resort through air Canada vacations we proceeded to spend 48 hours in different Canadian airports with zero support, compensation or even apologies from the airline. Not only were we stranded on the first night of our marriage but when we were told in Edmonton that we would be taken care of for room and board in Montreal, where we were to wait until the following evening to fly, we were informed after landing that they hadn't arranged for enough rooms. As a result, my wife and I had to spend an additional 280$ on the only room left anywhere near the airport. As it was already very late at night we were only able to sleep for 5 hrs before we had to catch another plane backtracking to Toronto where we would continue our layover for another 10 hrs. The trip started at 7am on a Saturday and we ended up arriving in Dominican monday morning. After many attempts to talk to phone representatives, as suggested by all the management at the airports, we were able to convince them to leave us with 30$ food vouchers for 2 people and 48 hrs of travel! Anyone you talk to in this company has their hands tied and is very willing to hand you off to another person or direct you to another phone number where you wait on hold, once for 2.5 hrs, only to be redirected elsewhere so on and so forth.  At least we weren't fully out of pocket for our days spent at the airport, having paid with a WestJet credit card of all things. One way or another our incredibly expensive honeymoon was cut down from 6 days in heaven to 4 and we were exhausted and deflated by the time we arrived",25th March 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to  Samana,Mar-19,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,39

I don’t expect to be pampered and cradled but they look so unhappy to be working. Every one one of the the 3 or 4 that we consistently saw in our area were all the same, miserable looking.

388,can’t complain to much,C Beale,TripVerified,"  Winnipeg to Toronto. Air Canada is the standard in Canada for reliable service. I purchased a Basic Economy ticket but purchased a preferred seat in the front rows of Economy. The only downside of this is that you remain in boarding Zone 6, meaning there is less space for bags overhead. The flight from Winnipeg is standard, short taxi and typically a short taxi to the terminal in Toronto if landing on the North runways. Overall the staff onboard are friendly, however they only come around 1 or 2 times so use that call button.

The 2017 experience left me sour on Air Canada but I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt because, hey, stuff happens. I haven't even taken my flight yet in 2019 and I can tell you my 2017 experience was no fluke. Everything that has happened thus far points to a company that lacks organization and is terrible under crisis and doesn't know how to deal with anything that may not go exactly according to plan. I booked my flight in January 2019 and I've had 6 e-mails already about my flight being rescheduled and there being itinerary changes. I have never in my life experienced this much dysfunction when dealing with an airline. If everything goes smoothly, I'm sure you'll have a fine flight, but it's when things go awry that you hope an airline would know what they're doing, and in my experience, Air Canada just doesn't. There are other airlines that will charge $100 more for the same flight. It's worth it, if for no other reason than the peace of mind to know that if something goes wrong, things will have some modicum of organization and a plan.",6th March 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Keflavik via Toronto,Mar-19,2,4,3,2,2,2,2,40

Firstly, their email and real-time updating on multiple of my flights has been inefficient. Our return flight was delayed by 2 hours and they sent an email to update on this information an hour before the flight departure. By this time we are already in line to go through security. We discovered that the cause for delay was because the flight crew had a mandatory rest time of 8hrs (and their previous flight had been late the night before) this means that the information on the flight delay had been known by Air Canada for at least 8 hours prior to the scheduled flight and they informed passengers only one hour before flight departure. In addition, our first flight to our vacation destination was also delayed and we received no updates on this until siting at the gate wondering why our flight hadn’t started boarding yet. To make matters worse, they did not prove to meet their revised departure time. We actually took off even later than the revised departure time. In both circumstances the email to update was not sent at a time that would allow us to make other plans to accommodate their lack of integrity. Secondly, I was not happy with the service on the aircraft. The stewardesses seem to have a lack of communication between their fellow employees. As they collected garbage I handed the stewardess a disposable coffee cup that had been used as a make shift garbage bin (full of banana peel and other garbage) she took the cup from me, then instead of throwing it away she proceeded to hand the cup back to me and said I will come back for liquids, and turned before I could explain there was no liquid in the cup. I felt uncomfortable because I was in the middle seat and this whole scenario happened while passing garbage back and forth in front of the passenger next to me (a stranger). To add further frustration, the stewardess did not return to take the garbage. When a different stuardess passed by I asked her to please take my garbage she responded in a rude tone “we already collected garbage”, I explained that the previous stewardess said she would return and had not, her reply was “I’ll come back then” She did end up coming back for the garbage, greeting me with “your garbage?” And then aggressively snatched the cup from my hand and stormed away. I felt humiliated and disrespected. This disappointing service has been consistent on multiple Air Canada flights, so often that I have come to expect this kind of service when I fly Air Canada. I have finally learned that flying Air Canada is not worth the frustration, confusion, and disrespect I encounter and will no longer consider flying with Air Canada in the future. I believe that there are much more details and events that Air Canada should be aware of if they are serious about improving their service.

400,offer good value and service,John Peters,TripVerified,"  Air Canada is really two airlines, a domestic one and an international one. On their international flights, they offer good value and service. The aircraft are new and well maintained and the service is very good. Notably, they have improved their food offerings over the past few years. The flight left HKG pretty much on time and I made my connection to Calgary. Inflight entertainment leaves something to be desired. The premium economy cabin is small, only three rows, and quite comfortable. Only one problem on the flight. We were not advised that passengers with connecting flights should claim their luggage. I recently flew through YVR from Paris and the bags went through to Calgary. However, there is a different policy with respect to flights from Asia, luggage is not automatically sent on to the final destination. It has been over a year since my last flight to Asia and so I had forgotten about this. It would have been helpful if a simple announcement had been made by the crew.",3rd March 2019,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Hong Kong to Vancouver via Calgary,Feb-19,4,4,5,3,4,0,4,41
401,incredibly efficient and friendly,P Harlen,TripVerified,"  Brisbane to Vancouver. Great aircraft for long-haul flights. Everything went seamlessly from check in to boarding, right through to in -flight service. I'm not a small person; however, had plenty of room . The seats were quite comfortable throughout the long flight. The service stands out. The service was incredibly efficient and friendly without being obtrusive. The food and drinks were pretty good and plentiful. The cabin crew provided water on a regular basis throughout the flight. The only suggestion I have is there is a lot of plastic in service and therefore a lot of wastage . The entertainment system is responsive but limited as to choices.",27th February 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Vancouver,Feb-19,5,5,3,2,5,0,4,41
402,"helpful, friendly and efficient",D Chacilan,TripVerified,"  I have taken AC527 between Boston and Toronto many times. The boarding area is very cramped especially between 5 and 8PM where four flights arrive and depart. The choice of food is from a single vendor namely Cosi and there is nothing to write home about. With Terminal B under renovation - there is nothing much outside either. Having said that I am however very happy with the performance of both the ground staff, inflight entertainment and the inflight crew. The ground staff are helpful, friendly and efficient. They keep a cool demeanor in this pressure cooker like environment - believe me when I say it gets hot in here. The flight was on time even though it was predicted to be delayed and the journey was painless. After a busy week of work this little trip of two hours was made painless by the effort of the professionals at Air Canada.",26th February 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Toronto,Feb-19,4,4,3,4,5,0,4,41
403,waste of time and money,Jessica Macmunn,NotVerified,"  Complete waste of time and money. My Husband and I planned a surprise getaway for our son for his birthday. Due to weather our departing flight was cancelled (understandably). The customer service from that point on was by far the worst experience we have witnessed. We were told that our flights would be rescheduled within an hour and they would notify us by email. The email link they sent was vague and we ended up calling and being left on hold for over an hour. when we finally reached an agent they advised that we could be re booked within 7 days! As we had car, hotel and attractions pre paid we requested an insurance claim but were told we had to deal with another department for this item. Eventually we were re booked the following morning but were flown out on 2 separate flights. My wife and son were flown to catch a connecting flight to our final destination while I was left on standby with a strong possibility of catching an afternoon flight. In total our 3 hr flights originally booked turned out to be a total of 30 hrs in travel time. While re booking I suggested other flights with air canada that were still posted as available on their website but they refused to allow us on these flights as they were a premium flight and not covered in their rebooking policy. All in all we missed our car rental (another long story) accrued extra hotel costs, additional car rental fees, and pretty much destroyed our holiday plans. To top everything off they lost our luggage on our return trip which thankfully arrived 2 days after we got home. To be clear, I dont blame the employees of this company as they are simply following the airlines rules. I blame a very poor business plan and management structure that is obviously designed to capitalize on any change of plan. We have had to submit a claim to our third party insurance company as neither the booking agency or air Canada's ""insurance"" will cover any of our additional costs.",24th February 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nanaimo to San Diego,Feb-19,3,1,1,3,2,0,2,41

Connecting flight arriving in Kingston at 2pm cancelled due to plane mechanics and rescheduled for next day (stranded in Toronto). Flight out of Kingston cancelled twice.

407,tight quarters,G Edwards,TripVerified, Edmonton to Toronto. This new plane looks all sparkly but it is tight quarters and by far the least leg room and aisle room of any plane I’ve flown. There is barely room to drop the tray to set down a drink. My husband is 6’4” and was curled up like a pretzel. The poor woman beside us was a little larger and couldn’t get in and out of the seat without twisting her body out into the aisle. The bathrooms were too small for some passengers. Staff at the check in counter at the gate were cold and unobliging. It wouldn’t hurt one of you to actually smile at a customer. Our steward was great. That’s the only positive about the flight. At the end they didn’t wait until passengers had disembarked before opening the back doors to service the plane in sub-zero weather. We could see our breathe and were last off the plane. Thank god the flight was on time. That’s the only saving grace.,19th February 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Edmonton to Toronto,Feb-19,1,4,2,3,1,3,2,41

After I passed the passport check and went to the last gate half an hour to my flight was noticed by email that my flight was cancelled.I called Pearson information and was told to go to Customer Service desk. I stood in the line for approximately 3.5 hours!! and expecting help to find a way to be in Mashad before Friday. At the counter one lady tried to find other flights to Mashad before Friday but she could not. I was to find a way between cancellation and getting there later than Friday for my father in law funeral).I called my agency and they told me if they send you by another airline to Montreal which flights at 8pm you can get to Mashad. I talked to the lady and was told that it should be Air Canada airline. I cancelled my flights with a broken heart and dissatisfied of this customer service. I missed the funeral.

410,what a terrible experience,Ela Brace,TripVerified," Terrible experience flying with Air Canada! We arrived at the airport, having checked in online. We went to the check in counter to drop off our luggage and our get tags for our one-year old's stroller. The girl at the check-in counter was in training and was kind of lost, couldn't find our booking. She finally figured it out and was printing our boarding passes, when her supervisor showed up. He was extremely rude, combative and arrogant. He took our passports, saying he had to check our visas, and disappeared for about one hour, while we were standing with our baby and wondering if we would even make it to the gate. He then came back and just gave us our passports, no explanation, no apology. We asked him to print our boarding passes, and he just walked away! We called him again as he was walking away, he came back, and said, ""that's it, I'm getting you off this flight!"" We explained to him that this is not acceptable, and we would complain. He finally caved in, but what a terrible experience. We couldn't believe this was actually happening. If this guy is a ""supervisor"" at Air Canada, that says a lot about the company itself. And it's such a shame they carry our country's name.

Having arrived at 5 am I now sit in the Newark airport for around 9 hours waiting for my plane. Crazy me I choose air travel as it is quicker than driving. Not so with Air Canada. Plus not even an email to update me on the change. Maybe they need to consult the long island medium to first see why it was cancelled since no one from their company seems to know or care.

We were provided with a hotel room and shuttle for the night and promised breakfast and lunch but only given $7 voucher for a breakfast buffet being $26, we ended up eating protein bars until we could get to the lounge at the airport. Flight is delayed over an hour again, and we’re given $15 credit on boarding pass for food, good for one sandwich. We only knew about this as another passenger advised us as they got it due to putting up a stink.  This is unacceptable customer service. I’m using vacation days to sit at person airport.

419,nothing wrong with this flight,B Callon,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Amsterdam. Essentially, there was nothing wrong with this flight, but it was not great. If it wasn't for the fact they were offering a terrific deal on a direct flight, I would have paid a bit more to travel with a European based airline. The service on a full flight was stressed. Frazzled is not quite the right word, but slightly chaotic and slow is probably a good description. Flight attendants were there to do their job, nothing more. Food was ok, standard fare, but warm and cooked well. I chose pasta with a tomato-based sauce. The seats felt a bit too cramped for a 7hr+ flight. Not a great recline either. A positive of Air Canada is that the full bar is available in economy class, something that makes a long-haul flight a little more enjoyable. On the ground though, they were really helpful. For this trip, I travelled with my wheelchair bound daughter. Often, we've found, any communication of her special needs onboard is not relayed to the airport staff. In this case, the staff at YYZ were ready to help and made sure she was properly helped on and had all she needed in place. Pre-flight attentiveness makes a lot of difference to us when we travel, and for this, I can recommend Air Canada.",25th January 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Amsterdam,Jan-19,2,2,3,2,5,0,4,42

421,Awful service,Nishanto Pishon,TripVerified," Toronto to London. The most horrifying trip of my life! I will never be flying with Air Canada and will tell my friends and family to do the same. My flight was from Toronto to Dhaka via London and Delhi.; December 29th to January 19th I got my ticket early October with all seats selected and luggage insurance. Ticket was changed last minute with changed awful seats without permission and wouldn't allow to change it. On the day of the flight, it was delayed and I missed my connection. To which, Air Canada re routed me to a much longer flight with long delay. I also missed my domestic connection and even after repeated complaints, nothing was done about that. I was suggested to notify the agent about my luggage the next day, which I did. They still lost my luggage. I received my luggage 3 days later with no apology or refund as the insurance suggested. I was given the last seat in the middle row right beside the washroom (despite allocating the seat and booking it 3 months in advance). This was after I had explained and requested my situation. I boarded the flight from Dubai and right after they declared a delay due to ""technical difficulties"". I was starving and willing to even pay for some food; there were no flight attendants to be seen in this time. Flight reached delayed by another hour at Toronto and apparently there was no gate arrangement so we waited another half hour to 45 mins in the plane at the airport after landing. The luggage took forever to come: another hour and half! The flight was supposed to land 5:00 am, landed around 8:30 am and by the time I could get out of the airport it was 10:00 am.

422,always had some kind of hiccup,Jason Dutrisac,TripVerified,"  We have flown with Air Canada well over a dozen times in the past two years, every trip always had some kind of hiccup, mostly minor things for the most part, but our recent trip Jan 16th 2019 was the final straw for us.We were departing from Saint Louis flying to Toronto and then getting a connecting flight from there. While at the gate in Saint Louis waiting to depart, the captain announced that the plane is off balance and he needs to do some adjustments, so he makes the announcement that all women must sit at the front of the plane and the men must go to the back of the plane (safety first, no problem). Meanwhile all of this meant that we were 45 min late to depart Saint Louis, later on during the flight the captain announced that he realized that some of us had connecting flights and put our minds at ease by saying that the connecting flights would wait for us. Our flight from Toronto was to departure at 10:10pm, after sprinting through the airport we got to the gate at 10:05pm, the girl at the gate told us that she was told to release the plane. We then complained to customer service and they said 'oh well its not our fault it was the weather', and then he says to us : 'you guys should of had time to get through customs and make it here on time' we're in our 30's and we are in good shape, there was no way that even an Olympic runner wouldn't of made it on time! we continued to argue that the captain wouldn't take off because of the weight issue.

My flight was supposed to be at 1:45pm, it’s delayed until 4pm so far so might get further delayed. Every time we get closer to the flight time they send another email delaying it further more in increments of 15 minutes it has been absolutely annoying.

424,very upsetting to pay so much money,Balbir Sandhu,TripVerified," My elderly dad is old and has limited mobility. After careful consideration, I decided to pay the extra money to upgrade him and I to premium economy on our return trip from India to Canada. When we checked in our luggage, the Air Canada attendant only marked two of the luggages as priory and not the other two. When we arrived to Canada, we got two of our luggages right away and the other two we waited 1.5 hours for. There are only a few perks for paying so much more money to upgrade to premium economy and having gotten our luggage right away would have been very nice. My father was struggling with the waiting. I complained to Air Canada and they offered me 15% off on my next ticket purchase and this offer expires in a year. I am not going to be doing any travelling for the next year due to having surgery and work commitments. I asked Air Canada for a bigger discount (because I purchased two premium tickets) and a longer expiry date so that I can actually make use of their goodwill gesture. Air Canada came back saying that was the best they can do. Of course they can to better than that. They just chose not to. This speaks volumes to me about how much they actually care about customer service. Needless to say, it is very upsetting to pay so much money and to not get everything you paid for.",17th January 2019,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Delhi to Vancouver ,Dec-18,4,4,4,4,1,2,1,43

No one is answering the phone and everyone we did get to talk to was zero help and they were all rude. I called them about 50 times with no answer, so I waited. They called me at 11pm the next day after I was already suppose to have my bags the day before and said they’d be there later that night. I got my bags 3 days later.

Comfortable seat with good recline, free pillow and blanket, good entertainment system, friendly multilingual staff (at least 4 languages spoken--English, French, Mandarin, Cantonese--probably Spanish as well). Asian vegetarian meal was OK, could use a little more protein and more flavour for parts of it, but certainly adequate. Free beverages to go around. Only complaint is that the toilets were not very clean -- toilet bowls clearly had not been cleaned adequately for many weeks.

Had trepidations about booking with them based on existing reviews but wanted to avoid having to pay an additional $800 for a non-stop with another carrier. Outgoing packed a medium size carry-on in case checked luggage does not arrive with me. Turns out this precaution was totally not needed. Air Canada was wonderful. Ground staff were friendly, and importantly, were intelligent and understood passengers' questions. On all 4 flight sectors, service was efficient. On all flights but the last, FAs were cheerful and went about their tasks with a smile. Food was mediocre, but, really, who realistically expects fine dining in economy? Plenty of liquids and juices on board. Legroom was okay. Had an aisle seat for sectors 2 and 3, and middle-guy and window-guy could easily slip by without my having to stand up. All flights on time.

429,get rid of their new baggage fees,M Charson,TripVerified,"  I flew from Toronto to Geneva (with a stop in Montreal) on an A330 and returned to Toronto from London Heathrow on a Boeing 787-9. Air Canada has changed its economy class setup and now charges $60 each way to check in a suitcase on long-haul flights. This is by far my biggest gripe - one of the main reasons I choose to fly Air Canada is that the fare used to include all the essentials, unlike many of their competitors. Sadly, AC are starting to go down the nickle-and-diming route. Surely everybody who goes on a long transatlantic flight needs to check in a suitcase, so why not just include it in the airfare like before and spare everyone the hassle? This makes the online check-in process much longer and more cumbersome, as billing address and credit card info. all have to be entered as well as everything else. Very annoying and pesky. You also no longer get to choose a seat at the time of booking and instead have to wait to see what's available when checking in, though I wasn't too annoyed about that. Bag-drop at Toronto Pearson was fully self-service - I was even able to place the suitcase on the belt myself without any staff being present. The flight to Montreal and then on to Geneva was on time. Unlike on many newer aircraft, the older A330 has the advantage of having nice wide seats with excellent legroom and good seat cushioning. The IFE was okay but not quite as good in the newer cabins. Unfortunately I was seated in the middle of the aircraft by the washrooms, which was very bothersome on an overnight flight. The stopover in Montreal is a curious setup as I had to get off the plane, wait at the gate, and then get back on it into the same seat about 1.5 hours later. The cabin service was usual Air Canada - generous with the drinks, less so with the food. The pre-landing snack of a small slice of banana bread was inadequate. The return flight on the very new 787-9 was pleasant - the seats were not as narrow or as firm as I feared they might be. The IFE was better than on the older A330, though still not as good as some other airlines'. Cabin service was the usual - pleasant enough. On both flights, the captain and first officer stood with the cabin crew to say goodbye as passengers disembarked, which I thought was a very nice little touch. Arrival at Toronto Pearson airport was the usual complete disaster - we had to sit for over an hour until a gate opened up, and then they couldn't get the bridge to fit properly. And the usual pandemonium at the baggage reclaim, but none of this was AC's fault. Overall, perfectly pleasant flights and very glad that AC has finally got rid of their ancient 767s! I just wish they would quickly get rid of their new baggage fees for long-haul flights.",8th January 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Geneva via Montreal,Jan-19,4,4,3,4,3,0,4,43
430,was an excellent flight,D Leare,TripVerified,"  Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver. This was an excellent flight in a brand new 737Max. Upon boarding staff were cheerful and helpful. The seating was roomy and was in the front row window seat as it is easier to get in and out around the passenger beside me. The IFE has much larger screens and more selections than the other AC narrow body planes. I really appreciated that. The attendant serving us in the front cabin was attentive with the wine and beverage service. As I fly AC a lot I noticed that dinner service had fewer choices and it was not served as courses nor were there 2 linens on the tray. Given this was a flight to a beach destination and I bought the return ticket at a very reasonable price, I can understand you would not get the same level of meal services I experience when traveling to Toronto, Montreal or Europe. One disappointment is the size of the forward rest room...thankfully I am a tall slim person. It would feel very cramped for some others. Also missing was the hand and face lotion that one typically finds in business class. This I missed as the air is so dry. I would appreciate it if AC would add that to the business class rest rooms on the 737Max. Check in was smooth and well organized. There is no lounge at PVR for front cabin passengers. The flight left on time and arrived early. I will be returning to Mexico on the same type of plane in the front cabin and look forward to the trip. I appreciate that AC has scheduled so many flights to Puerto Vallarta.",5th January 2019,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver,Dec-18,4,5,4,5,4,0,5,44
431,a terrible experience,Tamana Nezami,TripVerified,  Toronto to New York. Currently still waiting on the next flight out back home to NYC. They did not allow me to check in bags when I was 5 minutes late because their kiosk wasn’t working and printing out my bag tag. I wasn’t allowed to get on my flight even though I was there an hour and a half early. I had to pay $100 on top of paying such a hefty price for the flight. The people here made me go back and forth this airport to find where to go. Absolutely a terrible experience.,5th January 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to New York,Jan-19,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,44
432,No food provided,W Lagorski,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Toronto. No food provided, not even a pretzel! Extra charges for every piece of luggage checked in. All 3 flight during my one week vacation were delayed (4 hours the first one) The planes don't have enough in-cabin space to accommodate traveler's belongings. I had to check in my carry-on in the end. Service was about the worst I have ever experienced. Service was interrupted at one occasion due to turbulence, I asked for a coffee but since they could not serve hot beverages during that moment the flight attendant gave me an empty cup so that I can claim my coffee when the seat belt sign went off. Waited an hour for them to come see me (that little light to call assistance is useless on that flight because they ignore you). Once she came back, took my cup and that was the end of it. Waited for 2 hours for a coffee I never got. ",4th January 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Toronto,Jan-19,2,1,0,0,3,0,1,44
433,absolutely appalling,S Healey,TripVerified,"  St. John's to Boston via Halifax. The original flight out of St John's left 1.5 hours after scheduled departure although the status was not delayed and we boarded reasonably on time. Landed in Halifax and got back onto the same plane to go to Boston after clearing US customs. Got to Boston and my bag had not made it out of Halifax although both of my husband's bags made it. We filed a delayed baggage report with the Air Canada baggage office in Boston on 1 Jan 2019 - same day as our flight. We flew on to Las Vegas and were informed that the bag would be routed to us within 2 days. It is now day 4 on the 4 Jan 2019 and we still have no bag. We have spoken to at least ten different people on the phone number provided for Air Canada delayed baggage. Turns out we are dealing with a call centre where there are no clear lines of communication as we have now been told about five different versions of where my bag is. We decided to get in a cab and go to Las Vegas airport to see if we could find out more information. Air Canada have a shared baggage office managed by a different company. They told us the bag was no in Toronto and most definitely not arrived in Vegas on 3 Jan 2019 when it was supposed to reach us. We called the delayed baggage number again and actually ended up giving the phone to one of the staff at the office because the guy on the phone was adamant our bag arrived in Vegas - turns out he was wrong. We are due to fly home to Australia on 4 Jan 2019 so gave numerous instructions to now get the bag to our home address - we verified that this information was on my file reference on the World Tracer website - great we can see the information on there, my bag might get home! Oh wait we just called Air Canada delayed baggage hotline and have been informed it is now going back to Boston from Toronto and is not scheduled further than that. Now we have already told these people numerous times we don't live in Boston. So after giving clear instructions again for at least the fifth time that the bag needs to now get to Australia, we are still in limbo. It is impossible to actually speak to someone directly at Air Canada because they have made themselves fantastic at being unreachable - no email addresses or phone contact numbers. The delayed baggage call centre cannot communicate accurate information and don't know anything but those are the only people you can speak to. We fly regularly every year and have used many different airlines. Never have I experienced anything like this. The customer service and assistance at Air Canada is absolutely appalling and I am astounded that an airline can operate like this. By the way Air Canada, I am still waiting for my bag.

434,the first option on my list,T Sealy,TripVerified,"  Houston to Frankfurt via Montreal. I showed up at the Houston airport without my passport and there was not time to go home to get it and return. The flight had been booked through Priceline so I called them. They said I was out of luck and there was nothing they could do. Then I tried calling Air Canada who the flight was through. The Air Canada lady worked hard to find an alternate route to Tel Aviv the same day since I had a tour starting the next morning. She was able to get an alternate route booked for me later in the day at no extra charge. I loved the plane, the food, and the personnel, not to mention that Air Canada was more affordable for me.

After exchanging several emails with customer service that we should get a hotel room all we got is a 15% discount in the future. We were lucky we had friends so we stayed with them but that should not have been the case. We had to pay for the luggage storage at the airport plus we both lost 1 day work so it all adds up quite a bit.,3rd January 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Vancouver,Jul-18,2,3,3,3,2,3,1,44
436,very special concierge service,S Felscher,TripVerified,"  The flight from Toronto to Santiago de Chile started with a great meal at the Toronto Signature Lounge and the usual great comforts in a bus class flight. What was very special this time was the concierge service by on the ground in Santiago. Due to 1/2 hour delay we had to meet our domestic flight within one hour - tight!

437,has direct flight to Delhi,L Sharma,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Delhi. One of the clear advantages Air Canada has the direct flight to Delhi. However, there flights whether direct or not is really expensive compared to their competition. The change fees for a flight are enormous and the food wasn't too great. The cabin crew was friendly but I found the seats   a bit too small. The entertainment system compared to Lufthansa and United is not good enough.

439,staff were accommodating,K Ryston,TripVerified,"  Frankfurt to Toronto. The check-in process was quick and easy. I flew with my husband and two small children (nearly 2 years old, and 4 years old). All of the staff were accommodating and professional. My children were given toys and colouring books to entertain them during the flight. Our flight was pretty empty so they were able to spread my family out over a few seats to give us more room, and they checked on me frequently to see if I needed and water or anything, or to play with the children for a moment. The only downside being that children under 2 don't get a meal, but they had some left over and brought me one for my daughter anyway. Our connecting flight boarded much earlier than it was supposed to, so we had to run to the gate and didn't have time to get any snacks or water before boarding our long flight.",30th December 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Toronto,Nov-18,4,5,4,5,5,0,4,44

Then when they did serve water, the cup had a hole in bottom and attendant watched as water poured out onto myself and guy next me. The two attendants then started laughing about it.

After inquiring with the airline I discovered that they no longer issue points for most flights other than upgraded classes or higher priced fares for same route. I fly often for business but obviously won't charge my company more money for a higher fare just to get points.

450,delayed on the tarmac for five hours,Nahanni McKay,TripVerified," We took Air Canada from Calgary to Vancouver during a huge snow storm. We were delayed on the tarmac for five hours for only a one hour flight. The captain said we only had twenty minutes left about six times. We eventually learn our flight was cancelled and head back to the gate. Only to learn that our flight was in fact not cancelled and we had to wait to get the plane de-iced again. We live in Canada so this is expected to have a major snow storm. The people on the plane were tired, cranky and we were all hungry. We were also not offered free food or drinks during our delay. Which by the 4th hour we all really just wanted a beer. But Air Canada gave the flight a e-coupon to everyone that went through that experience which really made an impression that Air Canada cares about their customers and their status. Thanks to them I am able to spend Christmas with my boyfriend this year in Vancouver. Hopefully there is not another snow storm.

451,have nothing but good things to say,Robert Pierce,TripVerified," This is my fourth or fifth trip with Air Canada and I have nothing but good things to say about my experiences. The terminal used for Canadian domestic flights at Vancouver is quite dated, but plenty of options for eating and drinking while waiting for the flight. Volunteers were requested to check carry-on bags (something I always count on happening, as my carry on tends to be quite heavy, always a treat). Boarding was expeditious considering the size of the aircraft, and we were soon on our way. Food and beverage service was an average pace and quality. Buy on board options were quite pricey, so I abstained. On their newer aircraft, AC's inflight entertainment is some of the best in the industry. Arrival into Toronto was early and the flight time overall was one hour quicker than scheduled! Connection in Toronto is always such a breeze, and USA pre-clearance in Toronto means you arrive into the USA without a need for passport control. Toronto to Boston was a standard North American flight of fine quality. Air Canada's gates in Boston are right next to baggage claim and the exit. Regarding money matters, I paid $173 one-way for this trip, which is quite reasonable for transcontinental journey.

There was 1 bathroom for premier economy but all economy passengers were allowed to use it.

They turned a 23-hour flight into a 36-hour flight. Dropped my frequent flyer miles, added a flight — economy class — w one half hour to go through customs and immigration, get my suitcase and make the transfer. Of course I didn’t make the flight (I pointed it out to them when they were booking — they said I might be able to make it if everything went well). I had bought my ticket directly from the airline to avoid any problems. In the end, they refunded me $113. Never Air Canada again.

454,it was a satisfying experience,Krzysztof Grzymski,TripVerified," Trip YYZ-YYC (return) went smoothly with airplanes full in both directions. Departure from Toronto was delayed due to medical problems of one of the passengers, but we arrived on time to Calgary. The return flight was delayed 50 mins partly due to the deicing procedures in snow covered Calgary. The seats were fine, although had some breadcrumbs on the YYC-YYZ flight, the crew was friendly, IFE available only if you purchase the headphones. Food on this four hours flight was offered only for purchase. On the first leg the stewardess reminded me that I prepaid in advance and so I had a vegetable wrap which was pretty bad. I forgot that I also paid for food on the return flight and thus I missed the meal, but considering its poor quality this did not matter. Otherwise it was a satisfying experience. I presume that the usual long wait for luggage on arrival in Toronto is the fault of the airport services and not the airline.",6th December 2018,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Calgary ,Dec-18,3,4,1,0,3,0,3,46

I also used the Air Canada lounge in both LAX and in Toronto which were ok (although the Air Canada Lounge in Montreal has better food). The only negative point was the check-in at LAX. There was a long queue at the priority check-in counter and the (rude) check in staff refused to give business-class passengers priority through using the other (economy) check-in counters.",5th December 2018,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Toronto,Dec-18,4,4,4,4,1,0,4,46

Arrived with 30 minutes to catch a separate flight to KLIA as that flight was delayed as well, but was already disembarked with no choice. AC representative stated we would be given $100-200 meal ticket in compensation, but it turned out to only be HKD75 (C$12.50) The cheapest meal available at the HK airport was HKD90.

460,worst traveling experience,Stella Smolkin,NotVerified,"  My husband and I had booked a flight AC85 from Tel Aviv to Toronto, on November 24. We had a connecting flight from Toronto to Newark (flight number AC7654), which was supposed to depart at 18:40 on November 24. The flight from Tel Aviv was delayed by over an hour; however, the pilot did his best to get us to our destination as soon as possible. As a result, we arrived at the Toronto Airport with an hour to spare before our next flight. We arrived at our gate at approximately 18:10, the boarding time. However Air Canada notified us that we weren't permitted to board the plane because our plane was late, and they didn't have enough time to store our luggage. Despite telling her that they could've sent the luggage to us the next day, she persisted that we weren't allowed to board, and gave us a pamphlet, ""Interrupted Trip Information"", a hotel reservation for the night, $15.00 each for dinner at a restaurant, and tickets to Newark for the next day. Afterwards it was brought to our knowledge that the flight was overbooked, which may be the reason for us giving up our seats on the original flight. We then had to fly to Montreal, and then to Newark. Consequently, instead of arriving at Newark at 20:00 on Saturday, we arrived at Newark at 16:30 on Sunday. This behavior was unprofessional to say the least.

461,the food is poor,W Cooper,TripVerified," My Air Canada flight left Hong Kong at 20.00. A meal was served shortly after take off. It was so bad I left almost all of it. If I'd had any idea that would be the case, I would have brought something on board. Talk about stale, you couldn't even get a fork through the dessert cake. Surely someone should be checking the quality of the food. To add to my disappointment, there was only one opportunity for a beverage. I would have dearly enjoyed a second glass of wine, but it was not an option. Clearly, either a tea totalling crew or that's the new limit. There was not an option of a snack or non-alcoholic beverage. Shortly before landing, we were served breakfast. I can't remember exactly what it was, but again, it was not good and the bun was so stale, I couldn't even tear it open with my fingers. Why even serve bread that must be a month old? Doesn't anyone do a quality check? The entertainment options were poor. Most movies were old. I think there might have been only a couple of current films offered. Seating was fine, but given the upcharge to fly premium economy it was not worth it. I've flown long-haul flights with Air Canada before, sometimes business class, sometimes economy. Sometimes the flights were good, but more often than not, the food is poor and the flight attendants seem to act as they would rather be a home. Last time I will fly an Air Canada long haul flight.

After arguments with the baggage lady, my husband and I were charged for both of our first complimentary bags. Of course, we proceeded to have our bags refunded which were denied despite the fact that our booking confirmation states that our first bags were complimentary. We made sure when we were booking it had the little baggage icon to show baggage was included. Not to mention these were both direct flights we booked.

463,they can't let me board,Yan Guo,TripVerified,"  St John to Los Angeles via Toronto. The first flight scheduled to depart at 5:00am. However, it was delayed by 30 minutes. The weather was OK. I arrived Toronto around 7:00am local time. My next flight to LAX is at 8am. I ran all the way through security, US border and arrived gate F69 at 7:40am. Then the gate lady told me my bag is not delivered yet and they can't let me board. I then ran to the customer service of Air Canada. I asked them what option I have now and I told them that I have to arrive LA before noon. The two senior ladies were helpful. They were trying to find flights to SF or San Diego. However, the third lady denied each proposal. The flight to SD would be OK for me because I can rent a car and drive up to LA for the appointment. However, they were all denied by the other agent. The senior lady issued a $15 meal voucher to me but I was furious after the agent asked me to go away otherwise she will rip off the voucher.  I have to accept the next flight which is 4 hours later. When I booked the ticket, why the itinerary designed for only 1.5 hour transfer if the bag transfer is so inefficient? What about the boarded passengers with transfer flights? Why the bag is even slower than myself? I have to wait to clear the security and US border and I can manage to arrive the gate 20 minutes before departure.

464,get another kind of compensation,N Charele,TripVerified,"  Brussels to Montreal in January 2018. When I arrived in Montreal, my luggage was not there. I had to wait for it 5 days and it was a mess to get the right information. They called me two times, lying me because they actually didn't know where my luggage was. I had to argue with the customer service to be delivered at my place out of work schedule. I filled the form to get a compensation but they suggested me 15% off for 4 tickets. I usually travel alone. I contacted several times the customer service to get another kind of compensation which could fit with my situation but I never got an answer or a call which is what I asked for.  When we ask for being called back, the first thing to do is to call back. The worst customer service I've  had to deal with.",26th November 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Montreal,Jan-18,3,3,3,3,2,0,1,47
465,we were simply too late,K Song,TripVerified,"  I was scheduled to take a flight from Toronto to Indianapolis with my ticket that was booked through United Airlines. But the plane was operated by Air Canada, and we were told to drop our bags off at the Air Canada counter. We arrived at the counter 45 minutes before the departure, the lady at the counter simply dismissed us saying that we were too late. She simply kept saying she was sorry that we were simply too late. Now I have wasted 4 hours because of a layover and I'm beyond upset for being treated this way. But United was helpful enough to rebook us through this trip and would like to thank United Airlines for its service.

466,made so many mistakes,Sheldon Banta,TripVerified,  My original flight would have taken me from Dallas to Montreal to Vancouver to Melbourne. My problems started when I was not allowed to place my bag into an overhead compartment on my first flight leaving from Dallas because of a lack of available space. After checking my bag at the gate and boarding the plane I observed a flight attendant access her belongings which had been conveniently placed in an overhead compartment inside the passenger area of the aircraft. My next flight leaving Montreal was delayed 90 minutes due to engine problems which forced me to miss my connection in Vancouver. I was then rebooked on a flight to Sydney which was delayed for 60 minutes. When boarding the plane in Vancouver I noticed I had not been placed in a seat with upgraded leg room which I had paid for months before. When I inquired as to why I was not in a seat with more legroom I was told the flight was full and there was nothing that could be done. Upon arriving in Sydney I was met by an employee who advised I would be unable to make my connection flight from Sydney to Melbourne and handed a new ticket for a different flight. While in Sydney I found out that my luggage was still in Vancouver. I did not receive my luggage for 48 hours. After boarding my first flight leaving Melbourne there was a power issue forcing us to be grounded for just over an hour. This caused me to again miss my connection in Vancouver and Air Canada wanted to rebook myself and other passengers on another Air Canada flight. The problem with that was our original flight was from Vancouver to Dallas and they now wanted to rebook us on other non direct flights. After voicing my concerns I was booked onto an American Airlines flight in order to fly directly from Vancouver back to Dallas. Upon returning to Dallas I was again informed that my luggage did not make it to the new plane and was still in Vancouver. I filed a complaint online on November 18th after all the problems arrived getting to Australia. I contacted customer service since customer relations does not have a phone number on November 22 to check on the status of my complaint. I was informed by customer service that there was no way for me to speak with someone over the phone in customer relations and my complaint could take up to 40 days to be investigated. I’m confused as to how this air lines could have made so many mistakes in such a short amount of time on every single one of my flights. Most of the crew was very polite but I am still disappointed and I will not fly this airline again!,24th November 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Melbourne via YUL / YVR,Nov-18,3,4,4,4,1,0,1,47
467,Staff was very attentive,T Darseno,TripVerified,"  Detroit to Rome via Toronto / Montreal. Transatlantic trip made by three segments. All flights pretty much on time, with easy boarding processes. DTW YYZ is a regional jet, hence, other than light refreshments and a squeezed seat, nothing much is to expected. Transit within AC’s T1 at YYZ was easy and smooth. YYZ YUL on 320 with PTVs (although the audio jack was not working at all). First time going through YUL and I expected to be much larger than that, probably on the same scale as YYZ. Easy boarding in Premium Economy (priority lane) makes settling in easy. Premium Economy seating is better than competitors (LH) with larger recline. Overall very satisfied. Good value for the money, as I bought a DTW FCO ticket for $ 560.00 and then paid $ 295.00 each way for the PE upgrade through bidding: I could have paid additional $ 600.00 each way and flown business. Staff was very attentive and offered a good quality of food. Entertainment system was top notch. Still, I would have expected AC to offer wi-fi service on its newer 787s.",21st November 2018,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Detroit to Rome via Montreal,Nov-18,4,4,4,5,4,1,5,47

The service was good menu options and they served 2 rounds of pre dinner drinks and the flight attendants were polite and accomodating.",19th November 2018,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Halifax to Toronto,Oct-18,5,5,4,5,5,0,4,47
469,seats are really tight,J Deepan,TripVerified,  Their Boeing 787 seats are really tight and uncomfortable. Seat pitch is 31 inches. Washrooms were few and dirty and long line ups.

470,mismanaged boarding process,B Harris,TripVerified," Vancouver to Toronto. I typically avoid Air Canada when I can but this November I had no alternative so I flew with them again. I was about to miss my flight so I called them to ask about my options. Turns out there is a rule for missing your flight within a certain time. Even though I asked, they told me my only option was changing my ticket for a cost higher than the original. What's worse the agent was trying to sell me an even more expensive fight saying that's the only option available. Luckily I had checked the flights before hand so I made him give me the cheapest option available. Still cost more than the original and I didn't need to pay that. Besides that the service was bad as always, but I was expecting that already. They've also got the most mismanaged boarding process.",19th November 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Toronto,Nov-18,3,1,1,4,2,1,1,48
471,delayed by almost 3 hours,G Paritolis,TripVerified,  I was scheduled to fly Toronto to Las Vegas in the morning at 8:30.

I arrived early at the airport today to find out it is delayed again by almost 3 hours. ,19th November 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Las Vegas,Nov-18,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,48
472,delayed and ultimately cancelled,B Neale,TripVerified,"  Toronto to New York. My flight was delayed and ultimately cancelled due to aground stop issues because of weather concerns. Obviously the weather delays are outside of Air Canada's control; however after waiting on the aircraft for several hours, we finally reached the delayed departure time when the ground stop was lifted and we should have been able to take off. It wasn't until this point that we were informed that the crew would go over their time limit if they continued this trip and that instead of heading to LGA we had to wait for a new crew. This is unexcusable as we had known about the ground stop for hours and Air Canada should have had the foresight to address this issue and switch the crew while we were waiting for the weather delay anyway. While waiting for the crew to switch we miss our window of opportunity as a new weather-related ground stop was issued and the flight was ultimately cancelled (meanwhile other airlines and aircraft had departed and made it to LGA during this time, as we should have). To add insult to injury, when Air Canada rescheduled my itinerary, they placed me on a new flight that was scheduled to depart YYZ on the 17th to make up for my cancelled flight that was supposed to leave on the 15th. However they did not rebook my originally scheduled return flight on the 16th so that my new itinerary scheduled a return flight before I even departed for my destination. When I first contacted Air Canada to correct this obvious problem, I was almost charged a rebooking fee to reschedule my return flight.  Every interaction required waiting in long lines just to speak to someone who had no idea what they were doing and would either send me to a different line or ask me to wait longer. I will never be flying with Air Canada again.",17th November 2018,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to New York,Nov-18,2,1,0,0,1,0,1,48
473,AC totally nailed it,S Gomes,NotVerified,"  Cleveland to Lisbon via Toronto. I had my flight cancelled due to a snow storm. I purchased my flight to United, but operated by Air Canada. When trying to reschedule, the options from United were just unreasonable (2 days later). Then I called the Air Canada customer service. They were willing to book me on the next possible flight even outside their alliance. This is just amazing and rare to see. You can sense when you have a good CS when problems come up and AC totally nailed it.",16th November 2018,Business,Economy Class,Cleveland to Lisbon via Toronto,Nov-18,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,48
474,Onboard experience was simply great,C Pearce,TripVerified," Excellent return trip from Calgary to Sydney. Check in was flawless and simple. Onboard experience was simply great. No shortage of food / snacks / beverages. I flew Business domestic legs and Economy on the long haul sector. Even in Economy, beer wine and spirits were free and generously offered to the mostly Australian and Canadian passengers. Most passengers in my vicinity were surprised as other airlines charge for this from North America, even long haul. Food was tasty - fish, chicken or beef. Snack mid flight and hot breakfast - chive omlette or maple waffles - prior to landing. Flight crew were professional and friendly, well dressed and attentive. Entertainment full of choices, enough for both directions. Seat confortable with good recline for Economy. No complaints at all, would recommend Air Canada for flights to Australia.

476,Not worth the upgrade,G Shearer,TripVerified,"  Pittsburgh to Frankfurt via Montreal. Not worth the upgrade. Premium Economy food horrible. Cold, rubbery chicken-ish thigh meat with stale cold rolls. Broken inflight entertainment at several passengers seats nearby including mine. Flight attendant barred passengers from using a bathroom directly in the cabin due to no apparent reason other than wanting her own privacy in the area between 1st class and premium. She forced passengers to 'go to the back of the plane' where lines and economy passengers were already overwhelming capacity of the available 2 commodes. Transit in Canadas major cities in my back/forth experience added agitation and chaos and was remarkably coldly delivered. Many missed their flights back to the U.S. on the return from Europe due to the lengthy custom points In Montreal and Toronto. There is very poor signage in both Montreal and Toronto airports and crazy long marches to other gates. Canadian airport workers pretend not to speak English and point you to move along and even misdirect passengers to the frequent and cumbersome security checks.

477,Seats are too tight,J James,TripVerified, Configuration and seat pitch of this aircraft (787)is not suitable at all for ultra long flights. Seats are too tight and not comfortable. Looks like Air Canada tried to put seats whereever they can find some space ignoring passenger needs and comfort. Very few washrooms on this 14 hours and 40 minutes flight were resulting in long line ups. Seat 30 C is only 20 inches away from washroom and avoid this row at all costs.

The seat I was sitting had water dripping down from the airconditioning for take off and landing. I pressed the button to receive help from the crew since this started and no one came for at least 20 minutes. Finally an attendant passes by. She did not recognize that I had the help button on. I told her of the situation and she said that it was normal. She didn’t try to relieve the situation other than letting me know that it was normal. Worst flight service. In addition to that my entertainment system didn’t work. The touch was off so I couldn’t use it.,31st October 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Seoul,Oct-18,1,1,2,1,2,0,2,49

I have to say that the crew involved were remarkably helpful and effective in their efforts to keep both the dog and owner and all the passengers around them comfortable and relaxed. I was really impressed that AC had cabin crew of this quality. It is easy to complain when things go wrong but the airline - and especially the cabin crew deserve recognition for their professionalism.,31st October 2018,Business,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Vancouver,Oct-18,4,5,4,4,4,0,4,49

They eventually sorted it out at the airport but it's just not good enough. They should have re joined reservations and done. Had an anxious 2 week lead in to the flight not knowing what was going happen with seating. Food on flight was some of the worst airline food I have seen. The service was surly and rude.

From boarding to deplaning, the inflight crew on this most recent flight were outstanding. Very professional, helpful, attentive and cheerful throughout the flight. I often find that after the meal service and duty free sales, crews are rarely about the cabins until later in a flight. Not so this crew - constantly on hand. I’ve travelled on a few five star carriers over the last few years and non surpass this Air Canada crew for quality of service.",26th October 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Vancouver,Oct-18,4,5,3,4,5,0,5,49
485,listening to every announcement anxiously,Sarah Jacques,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Halifax. Our gate was changed with no announcement, causing us to miss our flight. We are obsessively careful travellers, and we were listening to every announcement anxiously, especially leading up to our boarding time. Nothing came, so we asked why we weren't boarding yet. We were then casually told there had been a gate change. We ran as fast as we could to the new gate, but were too late. The attendant at the new gate lied and told us she had announced our gate change and even had announced our names several times. She didn't know we are anxious travelers who listen to every announcement, and insisted on repeating that she had indeed called us. I felt very disrespected, and i couldn't believe how blatantly she lied to me. ",22nd October 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Halifax,Oct-18,3,2,1,3,1,0,2,49

Unclear and poorly formatted website with contradicting info required me to spend an extra $200 and ruined what would have been a happy occasion getting a new pet. Customer service after the incident was very very slow and also rude. Took over 2 months to get a rude email response to my complaint and also phone staff was not sympathetic or helpful. Overall I felt that their customer service policy is “you have to know our arbitrary rules from our unclear website or you have to pay massive flight change fees.” I will avoid this airline in the future when I can.

Finally when the drinks trolley came by I asked for water, tea and wine. The staff said to me if everyone ordered 3 drinks he’d be here all day. Couldn’t believe his rude comment. Later a fellow passenger complained to be about how unfriendly the staff were so I wasn’t alone on that front. Trying to change a flight at the ticketing service desk in Vancouver was ridiculous. They were on hold for ages and didn’t give a damn about me standing there for half an hour to enquire. And that’s all I was trying to do, enquire. I missed one of my flights and because of that all my other flights were forfeited! Do not fly with these guys. Poor movie choices and wine. I highly don’t recommend them.",14th October 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Vancouver,Oct-18,2,1,1,1,1,0,1,50
491,able to do it myself online,W Starmer,TripVerified,"  San Jose to Calgary via Vancouver. Air Canada has some of the worst customer service of any airline I have flown on. There are times when I have had to change my flights and needed assistance doings so. I usually sit on the phone for 30 minutes because there are ""higher than expected call volumes"" before I am answered. On two occasions I have been quoted ridiculous amounts to change my flights on the phone only to find out I can do it for a fraction of the price online. The last time they tried to charge me $450 to change my flight and I was able to do it myself for $240 online - the price of the round trip flight was $500 so paying almost double just made no sense. To avoid flying Air Canada I would have to drive an additional 45 minutes to another airport (SFO) to fly Westjet,I think I will do that because dealing with AC is a horrible experience simply said their customer service hasn't gotten any better.

494,rerouted to a direct flight,F Barker,NotVerified,"  I had a conference to attend in Toronto. I was flying United and my itinerary was to fly from Hong Kong via San Francisco and then Chicago to Toronto. My United Airlines flight from Hong Kong was late to take off for over an hour and I only had an hour 25 minutes transit time. When I cleared the customs, rechecked my luggage, and ran to the gate, it was closed. After working through issues and arrival time, I was rerouted to take a direct flight from San Francisco to Toronto on Air Canada. This was my first experience with Air Canada and didn’t know what to expect. I went to the gate 45 minutes before the flight time, no one was even at the counter. The ground crew showed up around 25 minutes and didn’t start boarding until 10 minutes prior to the departure time.  I immediately asked a flight attendant to fill my empty water bottle after boarding. I then found out how smart the move was. First, this 5-hour trans-border flight included no drinks (not bottled water and you had to ask before they would give you water) or food. The flight attendants’ main duty was to sell earbuds, snacks, and drinks to each customer. Thus, it took them 3 hours to reach the last row where I was. Another issue was that they sold some kind of hot snack. One of the flight attendants walked by me numerous times loudly to do heating. They did not go to the next row until the ordered food was given to the paying customer. The interior of this plane was worn with rather uncomfortable seats and entertainment programs were ancient with mostly Canadian shows. The flight attendants could not offer any arrival information, not even the general temperature range at that time of the day, and Toronto was their hometown.",10th October 2018,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Toronto,Jun-18,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,50

The gentleman at the desk (which was even the wrong desk I was at) made a phone call and then walked me to the baggage drop and to the gate.

503,used to be much more reliable,M Hayton,TripVerified,"  I flew Air Canada from Heathrow to Toronto, arriving only to find that my suitcase did not arrive with me. When I lined up to report that it was missing, I found that other passengers had the same issues, with the same airline, and had come from various other destinations. One woman I spoke with had connected with my flight from Zurich, had sufficient layover / connection time, and yet her luggage also did not arrive. Passengers pay handsomely for flights. We comply with the airline stipulations regarding luggage. Is it so much to ask that our luggage actually gets on the same flight that we are on? In my case, when I was reporting it having not arrived (at @ 9:20 pm Oct 2nd in Toronto), I was told it was still at Heathrow.  In this day and age of much improved technologies, systems, communications is it so much to ask for your luggage to be put on the same flight that you are taking so that you are not inconvenienced? It seems to me that Air Canada has increased its arbitrary decision making about whether or not to send luggage on the same flight as passengers. Is it any wonder that passengers are increasingly taking bags stuffed full, and often overstuffed, right onto the plane with them? This practice of not bothering to load luggage onto the same plane as the passenger is on is not acceptable. There is no excuse.  Air Canada used to be a much more reliable airline than it is now. Even the meal offerings on board have become substandard. Time for Air Canada to buck up its ideas and improve in areas that it is receiving increased criticisms for.",4th October 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Toronto,Oct-18,2,3,0,0,2,0,2,51
504,have had no response at all,Linda du Toit,TripVerified,"  Victoria to Milan via Toronto. My flight left really late from Victoria and as a result my bags did not arrive with me in Milan. I was only there for 7 days, and staying at a villa in a really small town on Lake Como. Three of the people on vacation with me did not receive their luggage. The person handling the delivery was rude and would not speak English. One of us had to wait at the villa every day until all the bags arrived, because there was no reception and no one to receive the bags. Our bags arrived on the 3rd, fourth and fifth day of our stay. I have entered a claim, but have not even received a confirmation that the claim was received. On my return, the flight was again delayed in Toronto for over an hour. Many had connecting flights that were missed. We were given a hotel voucher on arrival, and also explicitly told that our bags were being taken off the flight and we were to pick them up and re-check them the next morning. The bags were not taken off and by the time I reached the hotel is was already 12:40 pm When I reached the hotel, I was told that it had been overbooked and that there was no room for me. I had to return to the airport where there was only one poor attendant dealing with all the many issues with Air Canada. Two of us had nowhere to stay. The airline only pays $150 for a hotel room, and there are none at that price near the airport, and they were all full. He finally found us a hotel, but we had to pay for it ourselves and were told to claim the $150 from the airline. My flight the next day left early so I only slept for 4 hours. I have also entered a claim, and written two complaints to the airline, and I have had no response at all, apart from an automated email saying they had received my message it is was 'in good hands'. There is also no way to call the airline. I am disgusted with the way this was handled, and want everyone to know how shoddy their customer care really is. Don't expect to receive any compensation for anything. You are just ignored.",4th October 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Victoria to Milan via Toronto,Sep-18,3,2,2,3,1,3,2,51
505,the flight was cancelled,Jack Campbell,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Victoria via Calgary. Had to have a layover in Calgary on my way to Victoria from Toronto. We boarded the flight on time, then sat on the plane not leaving the gate for nearly 5 hours. (Keep in mind, the flight from Calgary to Victoria is only an hour and a half). It was hilarious, the captains kept coming on about once an hour saying, ""great news, we are next in line and will be taking off in about 5 minutes"" I don't know where they were getting this information from or if they just thought it would be funny to mess with the customers. After 4.5 hours, everyone started receiving emails that the flight was cancelled. But the crew continued to say we were about to leave. Then everyone was kicked off the flight and told ""you have been rebooked for tomorrow"" when asking about hotels and accommodation, Air Canada said they were not going to provide any sort of accommodation resulting in elderly people sleeping on the floor.

506,No one helped us,Marina Savelyeva,TripVerified,"  Phoenix to Edmonton. We arrived to PHX airport 2.5 Hours in advance, at the time of check in we were not assigned the seats as per the agent words “seats will be selected at the gate”. When arrived to the gate, no one was there, but when the agent showed up, our flight was delayed and we were assigned seats at the very back of the plane. Seats do not recline and we have a dog (which doesn’t allow us to check in online), that’s ok, we will deal with it. My husband has back injury and surgery so he has to stand up to stretch, or so we thought, they didn’t allow that either saying that it is The US law not to stand up in the lavatory area as people as walking back and forth to the washroom and this can be a safety threat. Arrived to Calgary late! At the customs they told us to pick up our bags! Wrong! The bags were going all the way through! We are running late for our connecting flight and at the Air Canada counter the Air Canada lady said “Oh no worries the boarding just started, you have plenty of time, you will be ok if you hurry. Here we go, rushing through security, being late because of their delayed flight, and when we arrived to the gate we hear: “Oh sorry guys, you didn’t make the flight, but we have you on the stand by for the next one”. Our bags are gone and we do not even know if we can get on the next flight. No one helped us. Here we go running around simply embarrassed by the way we have been treated since the moment we came up to the Air Canada counter in PHX.

507,I missed a connection,R Korashan,TripVerified,"  One of my flights got delayed for 6 hours, so I missed a connection with another airline. I was okay with it, and I proceeded to look for alternative options with the customer service staff. The rebooking agent at the airport told me she could only rebook on a flight itinerary that would take two days to reach my final destination with connecting time up to 10 hours at two different airports, even though there were a lot more options available when I searched online. There were even seats with Air Canada's star alliance partner, but she would not book me with it. She said I needed to call Air Canada help center for more help. The Air Canada connection staff at LHR were the rudest. I approached British airways desk, and they checked me in for a much better connected flight with connections of only 3 hours. Inflight service was a little better. I though the inflight entertainment is okay with a good selection of movies and TV shows, but incomparable to Middle-Eastern and even, European carriers. However, the seat was really small, and tightly packed.  The food was insufficient. I don't know how Air Canada became a 4-star carrier.",22nd September 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to London,Sep-18,2,1,1,1,1,0,1,51

509,the communication was abysmal,Ann Manson,TripVerified,"  Below Standard. Chose to fly Air Canada to avoid LAX. Had been following the flight for some time, so very aware they are constantly late. Our flight was delayed due to weather, that can’t be helped, however the communication was abysmal. In total it was 5 hours, we were lucky to be in the business lounge. You don’t have to be Einstein to figure out how late a flight will be when it has to divert to Sydney to refuel. The ground staff, although pleasant, have no idea. Now to the flight. We have flown middle eastern airlines many times, so, you would reckon AC would be on a par for the price, well, you would be wrong. The food can only be described as sub standard, the service although pleasant, is what you would get in economy. When you pay big money you expect, well, better. No offer to makeup your bed, no champagne before take off, and using a trolley to deliver food. I’ll only say of the gift bag, pathetic.",20th September 2018,Business,Business Class,Melbourne to Vancouver,Jul-18,3,3,1,3,2,0,2,51
510,"Disorganized, dishonest, disappointing",Megan Zhao,NotVerified," Los Angeles to Geneva via Montreal. This is by far, the worst airline experience I have ever had and I have flown with many airlines. The flight was delayed not due to weather, no reason was given to passengers, no apologies. Once we reached the transfer location, even our next flight has not left. Air Canada told us we cannot get on due to the delay (but we saw the plane was still at the gate), so we had to fly the next day. Again, no apologies, customer service was rude and short. They gave us tickets for next day flight, but, we checked online, our flight did not leave until 30 minutes later! We could have enough time to catch our plane! The only reason I could think of is that they sold our seats to standbys. We were highly disappointed. They gave us dinner vouchers, $10 , but didn't tell us that it was too late for any meal. Disorganized, dishonest, disappointing. Will never use this again. Also, LAX to Montreal, 6 hour flight, no food, beverages only once. Flight attendant did not know how to smile or be nice.

Smiling and helpful. When I returned home I left my phone on the plane and stopped a random employee who could’ve said if they find it, it will be in the lost in found (or baggage claim) instead he went on the plane to look for it for me.

512,state of their customer service,L Satoun,TripVerified,"  Calgary to Ft McMurray. Air Canada in flight services and reliability is typically decent. I fly with them a fair bit. What I am reviewing today is the state of their customer service. Firstly, I should mention that, at the best of time, reaching them to modify a flight requires 20 mins of waiting over the phone unless you have the altitude member number (35K and over I understand).  But what I am writing to flag and rant about today is how difficult my last experience trying to obtain a justification of payment has been. The amount that was charged to my card for one of my last flights matches neither the amount I was expecting to pay nor the receipt sent to me. I initially reached the phone line and was sent to www.aircanada.com/en/customercare/ticketreceipt. I explained my request and never received any response other than a no-reply acknowledgment of my request. 6 weeks and 2 additional request (complaints) to the customer service went by. 20 days after my last follow-up, I finally receive a very helpful email that indicates that she is unable to help but that I should contact www.aircanada.com/en/customercare/ticketreceipt. 6 weeks and I am back where I started.

513,chaotic gate experience,T Eldem,TripVerified,  Brussels to Montreal on Air Canada. Our trip originated in Prague with the first leg operated by Brussels Airlines so upon landing in Brussels we proceeded to the lounge. AC uses Brussels Airlines lounge which was very crowded and had very limited food and drink options. We proceeded to the gate 30 minutes before boarding time and were met with a long queue for passport verification. When I went up to the counter to inquire if there were a separate line for business class passengers the agent simply responded by saying there was only one line and pointed to the back of it. We had somewhere in the neighbourhood of 150 passengers ahead of us and there were only two ground agents performing the checks. After 20 minutes in the line I went up again and asked why they did not have a dedicated line for premium passengers like they do at every other European airport. In a rather sarcastic tone the agent simply said “this is how we do it in Brussels”. We finally got through the line at which time I spotted the AC Concierge and immediately questioned him about the process only to be told that they do have a dedicated line for premium passengers. At this point I was getting quite agitated and asked him why it was not in effect that day. To that he simply said he did not know. We then went into the priority boarding line which was a joke as there had to be 100 people in the line. Finally the agents announced start of boarding but instead called for those in zones 3 and 4 ahead of the priority passengers. At this point the boarding became a free for all and resembled those you would see in third world airports. On board the service was great but the hard product was showing its age. Food was quite tasty but they had no red wine as they simply had not loaded enough on the inbound trip from Montreal. IFE has a reasonable selection and before landing we were served another meal which was also very tasty. Aside from the utterly chaotic gate experience it was a decent experience.,16th September 2018,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Brussels to Montreal,Sep-18,3,5,3,3,1,0,3,52

I have never experienced baggage delay ever in my many travels. Out of the 3 times, they only announced it once, meaning for two times I waited at baggage claim for 30 mins believing they had my baggage. Only by looking at the status of the baggage claim am I able to know to go to baggage services. Can't they take be proactive all the time and let people know so that they don't wait at baggage claim?

We were put up in a hotel at 1:30am only to get up at 5:30 for a morning flight, lost luggage to and from Europe, all with 2 little girls in tow. 2 days lost luggage in Zagreb, 5 days lost luggage in LA 6 days for the stroller. If I had known this I would have booked with another cheaper airline to get this service. the reply from customer service was a cut and paste ""we'd like to give you 25% off you next flight"" -  I don't think so! I have never written a review for bad service or delays, but this was too much. ",12th September 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Los Angeles via Toronto,Sep-18,3,3,2,3,1,1,1,52
517,seat I did not fit into,Nick Savino,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Rome. Flight was delayed and we specifically paid an extra 400 for premium seats and we spoke to the Air Canada Agent in reservations to make sure we had the correct seats on both legs of the journey since I had heart surgery and am a big man who needed the extra leg room and ability to raise the arm rests for more room. I was assigned a seat I did not fit into because the arm rests would not go up on this premium seat. The plane was full and no other seats could be given. My mother also had a seat whose arm rests would not go up but being smaller it was not an issue for her even though these were premium seats. On our return flight from Rome to Toronto we paid 300 for premium seats (total 700 for both legs wife came back on an earlier flight) and when we boarded the plane our seats had been given away and the premium seats we paid for two months earlier were not available. We were in row 45 which was the last row in Zone 3 with very little leg room. I had to take the middle seat since the window was too tight for me and the arm rest in the aisle would not go up. The flight attendant said there was definitely an error on the seats assigned and she made me follow her to the gate agent to see if anything could be done. The agent said all seats were full and there was nothing she could do. The plane was ready to depart so I took my seat and suffered on the 10 hour flight back. At the airport in Toronto there was no one to speak to regarding a refund and our experience with Air Canada as well as my medical issues and my mother being abandoned in Rome on her own in a wheelchair. I was told to call a number which was an office in Calgary that would need a letter mailed to them regarding the issues I experienced. I was also told to google a customer care website where I filled out the online forms for both my medical and my refund for the premium charges.  We specifically booked through Air Canada direct so we would be able to avoid any issues with other airlines or agencies and could deal with AC directly but it has been a nightmare trying to have anyone reach out to us or resolve our issues before, during and after the flight. Again today I have once again resubmitted our request for refund and am currently waiting. The customer service agent in reservation (50 min hold) said she cant do anything over the phone and it could take 2 months. She told me to send out a claim again online.",11th September 2018,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Rome to Toronto,Aug-18,1,4,2,2,3,1,1,52

After customs we arrived at gate to board to Toronto at 3:45 only to be told that they gave our seat to someone else because we couldn’t make it for 4 o’clock flight. Agents wouldn’t even answer our inquiries. At 4000 dollars round trip plus upgraded seats we had to wait in standby for the next flight to Toronto plus loose our priority seating.

519,not even an apology,S Thaylin,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Edmonton.  As I waiting for the flight at the gate, I heard a call for 4 volunteers who are able to take the next flight. The announcement also said those who volunteer will get a $400 cheque. I was the 2nd volunteer who went up to the female attendant at the gate and she dealt with all the paperwork and informed me that I was booked for the midnight flight. So, as per my previous plans I originally arranged for my parents to pick me up at the airport. As I took the next flight and was confirmed by the attendant, I informed about the change in time for my pick up. I was told by the attendant at the gate that I would get the $400 and my boarding pass after all passengers had boarded. After a while when everyone had boarded, I heard my name being called to the gate. I went up and talked to the other male attendant. He quickly asked for my ID and gave me a boarding pass and I was rushed to board the original flight. I was very confused and stressed with the sudden changes to the plan as I thought I was already confirmed and scheduled for the next flight. As I boarded the plane, I was told to quickly load my carry on in the front overhead compartments and I took my seat as per the boarding pass. The plane started to take off as soon as I was seated so I did not have enough time to contact my parents about the changes. When I landed in Edmonton, I tried my best to call my parents again but they had already went to bed in order to wake up at midnight to pick me up as per my previous conversation. I did not have any other options other than waiting at the airport until 2:00 AM when they finally came to pick me up. Overall, I was very dissatisfied with the service and the lack of understanding I received from the attendants. This is also only second time travelling so I was very scared and nervous about the whole situation. I called the customer service today about receiving the $400 cheque that I was originally promised but they told me I was suppose to receive it at the airport. I also emailed Air Canada but got a very generic response about their policy, didn't address my original compliant and also not even an apology.",8th September 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Edmonton,Aug-18,3,1,0,0,1,0,2,52

However, those that like to sit in the dark on day flights should be warned. FAs were available, friendly and attentive at all times.

521,still waiting for my bag,John Apuzzo,TripVerified,"  I have flown Air Canada many times and was generally satisfied with their service, yet my last trip was less than to be desired.  My flight from Paris to Toronto was delayed by more than 5 hours. The company stated the cargo door was broken when unloading merchandise. When we finally boarded we were not told we were to land first in St John's Canada to have a pilot change. They should have left us in Paris and resume normal schedules hours albeit a day late,  yet to add to this when the flight left St John's to arrive in Toronto, we were met at the Toronto airport by gate agents ready with hotel vouchers and new boarding passes for a flight to LAX the day after. I was told because the flight from Paris into Toronto landed after 9:00 PM there were no more flights into the US (we had landed a little past 10:00 PM). I went to the hotel where the shuttle took over an hour to arrive to pick us up after several calls to the front desk letting them know we were waiting (you would think the airline would have this a little more coordinated). Well by the time I got to the hotel it was midnight and I had to get up by 5:00 AM to catch the flight from Toronto to Los Angeles. Arriving at the airport at 5:45 AM I was told the flight to Los Angeles was delayed by one hour and 45 minutes so instead of leaving at 8:05 AM the flight now left at 9:45 AM. To add to the ordeal there also was a medical emergency on the flight to LAX, they flight had to understandably stay at the gate while paramedics attended to the patient. We finally land at Los Angeles a little before 11:00 AM only to find out my luggage did not make the flight. How can the luggage not make the flight when I was over 4 hours early checking in? (got to the airport 3 hours early for international flight and over 1 hour delayed flight - clearly they had plenty of time to verify and check the luggage). The personnel indicated to go to the Air Canada website to track luggage. Website provides little to no information. Basically has what I told them at the baggage claim at LAX yet does not track where the luggage is at.  After calling the agent at LAX, I was told my luggage landed at 5:00 pm.. I was told the delivery company has 24 hours to deliver me my bag.  Not only am I jet lagged from being in Europe I am told to stay up to be in receipt of my lost (now found mis-tagged bag). I am still waiting for my bag 12 hours after it supposedly arrived in Los Angeles.",6th September 2018,Business,Economy Class,Paris to Los Angeles via Toronto,Sep-18,4,3,0,0,1,0,1,53
522,flight has been changed,Y Kagisha,TripVerified,"  I booked the flights for later in September 2018 from Denver to Nagoya via Vancouver about 2 months ago. The original plan was making connections at Vancouver and the whole trip was around 18 hours. But a week before the departure day, they sent me an email saying ""Your flight has been changed. Check it out. If you have any questions, call us"". That was it. They didn't call me and just sent me the rescheduled flights. Like I've said, the original one was only 18 hours flight but the new one takes 3 days. ] Why should I stay in Canada for 2 days? ] Other flight tickets for the date got too expensive for me to afford. I called them right away and asked them to reschedule it and they did. I mean, they did have much better flights but they didn't give them to me from the get go. Now the flight time is around 25 hours which is not bad. But it was worse than the original one. On top of that, with those tickets, I have to make connections 3 times to get to Japan and I only have 45min ~ 1 hour for transit at each airport. I was concerned for the limited time so I called them again and explained everything to the operator. He didn't say anything while I was explaining and after that, he just said ""Yes, you have enough time. Any questions?"" It was so rude. He only said 2 sentences, didn't even name himself and hung up the phone. I told this whole story to my friend who got to talk to their supervisor and he arranged me a perfect ticket which was a direct flight from Denver to Vancouver of United Airline and upgraded all the flights. Why didn't they do this to me to begin with? Keep calling them until you get the best tickets I'll update this review after the flights.

Not very dreamy for a Dreamliner when the seats don’t have much padding and the toilet seat cover doesn’t even stay up. The attendants were forgetful (messed up on our drinks twice and forgot where we sat when we asked for headphones and too chit-chatty among themselves.

525,very happy flying with them,S Hussain,TripVerified, Montreal to London. Simply Amazing! I was on the verge of missing my flight as the airport transfer service from city is very poor and runs with severe delays (I was not aware of this). The ground check in staff realizing this whisked me quickly through the check in lane (where there were huge queues). I managed to get onto the flight. The plane was clean and nice. A B777. Fairly new. IFE was quite decent. Upon my request the check in staff very happily gave me a nice window seat as well. Food was decent as well. Cabin staff very courteous and polite. Flight landed almost on time (just few mins of delay which doesn't really matter).

526,6 days to get my suitcase,Tim Brust,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Charlotte. Flight was OK, but Air Canada's competence and caring stops there. I had a checked bag which they never sent to baggage claim. Since it was the last flight of the day (about 1 pm)--all Air Canada employees left the airport. I found that out after running from baggage carousel to baggage carousel and back and forth to the Air Canada desk and calling Air Canada customer service for two hours. They said they would contact the employees the next day and let me know what was up. Long story short--it took them 6 days to get my suitcase to me. I arrived on a Saturday but they didn't ship it out until Monday afternoon--and only because the flight was late and they were still there when the Fed Ex guy came. But it wasn't until Tuesday I knew it had beens ent--customer service knew nothing and I think just made things up. hey told me that the delivery guy didn't show up--and that the bag was going through a 48 hour security check--neither of which was true. And to top it all off--they didn't secure the shipping label properly--so the tag came off and was lost in transit. Did Air Canada customer service help? No--they had no tracking number--no information on the bag (which their website claimed was still missing) and no interest in contacting Fed Ex on my behalf. I had to track it down. I got my bag just in time to end my vacation and fly back home. I spent two to 3 hours everyday call Air Canada Charlotte, Air Canada customer service and Federal Express telling and retelling my story and tracking my bag down. Not a great vacation--and I had to wear the same couple of shirts and pairs of shorts I bought to tide me over for what I thought would be a couple of days without my clothes.

530,didn't have a Canadian visa,Christina Alejandro,TripVerified,"  Yesterday my husband and I were all set to fly to Boston via Montreal. 5 minutes before boarding, they told us that I couldn't fly because I didn't have a Canadian visa. Since I have traveled many times before to countries without needing a visa for transit, this seemed quite peculiar. They told my husband that possibly he can travel alone and then they would find me a later flight via Toronto (which allowed no Canada visa). I agreed and resigned myself to staying the night in the airport overnight 'cause we live so far away (expensive to get there too). Then they said, ""no seats available for tomorrow). Fast forward - we decided for my husband to leave without me. There was a wedding we were supposed to attend in Maine and I didn't want him to miss that. He flew and I went home late at night hoping I could carry my luggage back to our 3rd floor apartment. So my husband arrives in Boston and messages me that Montreal told him I didn't need a transit visa. Though the Air Canada ground crew were all very nice to us and apologetic, this could have been prevented if they were more thorough with their checking. It was our wedding anniversary and we had to be apart. Such a big disappointment and stress-inducer. Good thing my husband was calm even though he was so mad inside. But I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. Please learn from this very sad experience of ours.

532,international leg went smoothly,M Keane,TripVerified,"  Paris to Newark via Montreal. The check-in process from Paris CDG went smoothly and the flight and service were operated by a courteous and efficient crew on the first leg of my flight (CDG>YUL). Following U.S. Customs & Border Control, there was a delay in flights into New York due to weather. After a small delay, our flight (AC885 @7:55pm) boarded anyway. Following another two delays of about an hour each on the tarmac, the captain announced air traffic control in New York was cancelling all flights for that evening. It was already 10pm, so there were no flights after the weather cleared up until the following morning. The cabin crew was very kind and helpful. They wanted us to get home as soon as possible, but since they couldn't do that were handing us bottles of water and pretzels during the delay and apologized as we de-planed. That said, everything following was a nightmare only exacerbated by the unhelpful staff at the check-in desk of Air Canada in Montreal. Because our plane was canceled due to weather, they handed us each a brochure detailing their policy on inclement weather. While they could not comp a hotel room, they said they would reschedule our flight for the following day. Because I booked through United, however, I was not receiving email notifications on the status of the new flight, and could not see details on the Air Canada website because I could not find the reservation number in the confirmation from United in my email. It was getting closer to midnight at this point and, understandably, the staff is on overtime and wants to go home as much as we did, but they were only grouping about to speak in French (which I understand and speak fluently) about the customers being difficult. I understand their hands were tied with the flight situation, but they were discouraging customers standing in line to rebook their flights with the booking staff because ""everything would be processed automatically"", but they did not even want to help me navigate the website to find my tracking information. Since my ticket was a United ticket, they figured I was last priority. Finally, in this time waiting, they just brought out a small cart of ginger ale and other sodas. I had to specifically ask one of the staff for water (which there should have been a stock of for situations like this). Overall I would say the international leg of my situation went smoothly, but I would avoid using this airline in the future for how little they seem to want to do about rebooking clients on missed flights. The internal staff seems overworked and tired.",20th August 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Newark via Montreal,Aug-18,3,5,3,2,1,0,2,54
533,flight was very relaxing,J Damillene,TripVerified,  Boston to Frankfurt via Montreal. This is my first time traveling internationally through Montreal. The flight from Boston to Montreal was a short affair on a CRJ100/200 type aircraft. The in cabin service and the flight itself (landing especially) were very commendable. Extremely friendly and efficient. The leg from Montreal to Frankfurt as in a newer 787-800. The flight was very relaxing and the service was efficient and friendly - but not exceptional. Food was good and the seat was very comfortable. The amenity kit however is getting smaller and less useful. Some bar items from the menu were not available and that was not expected.,19th August 2018,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Boston to Frankfurt via Montreal,Aug-18,5,4,5,4,4,0,5,54
534,The flight was okay,J Lume,TripVerified,"  Munich to Toronto in Economy Class. The flight was okay. The crew was not especially friendly, they did their service and their work. The seat was okay, but very thin and I think it had less legspace than other u.s. airlines.  The first meal after take-off was okay in taste but in my opinion it was not enough. The second meal before landing was worse: it a tiny chicken wrap. Onboard entertainment was okay, no wifi. Air Canada serves free alcohol in economy class.

535,product did not impress me,J Luemer,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Munich. I found them okay, but not better than United or Delta. The Lounge in Toronto was disappointing - the Maple leaf Clubs in London an Frankfurt are better in my opinion. Toronto airport is more comfortable than Newark, JFK or Atlanta: it is way smaller. The onboard product did not impress me: food okay, nothing special. Inflight entertainment below expectations. Flight attendants not especially friendly and not attentive. I did love the window in the washroom, though. We arrived in Munich ahead of schedule but had to stay on the plane for 2h30m because part of Munich airport was closed, the flight attendants did not serve water or drinks unless you went to the galley at this time. Eventually the terminal reopened and everybody had to go through immigration which was not well organized by Munich airport. Would I fly them again? Yes, to give them a second chance and if they have a better schedule / are way less expensive than my preferred other carriers.

536,cabin crew were great,Mike Palmer,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Denver return in coach on an E190. Check in, boarding etc all uneventful. I know the E190s are due to be phased out next year, but the interior was tatty, and the USB ports on neither seat worked. (Both pushed inside the seat in front) That said the 2x2 seating and legroom is pretty good! Ok service with two rounds of T&Cs and juice offered by a hard working cabin crew member. On time arrival in Denver. The return however was disappointing. I was at the gate when the flight arrived with both fligh tdeck crew leaving the aircraft. They returned 20 mins later with food. After boarding, we pushed back late due to a fueling issue (suspect they weren't there to order it) We sat on the apron for 15 mins with no announcements. Finally, a PA from the flight deck that the plane had gone tech and would be towed back to the gate. Another 90 mins passed, with two announcements from the flight deck only, Cabin crew were great and present in the cabin passing out snacks and water. We left two hours late arriving in the early hours at Pearson. No arrival announcement or personal goodbye from the flight deck crew (unusual for AC) explained on the jet bridge - they were ahead of most of us customers. Really disappointing and poor customer experience from the pilots both during the delay in Denver though the cabin crew were great and professional",16th August 2018,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Denver,Jun-18,3,4,2,2,2,3,4,54
537,flight which was cancelled,K Hammen,TripVerified,"  Denver to Toronto. Last week we had a flight which was cancelled due to the weather which was not visible as cancelled on the monitors. The weather is not in the hands of Air Canada, so that was not their fault, however everything after was. After receiving a mail about the cancelled flight and asking the employees of Air Canada at the airport about it, the only thing they would do was let us call a phone number since the refused to help us at the desk. They told us they couldn’t and also wouldn’t contact anyone for us to see if we could get on another flight. After a wait of 1,5 hours on the phone we were told they would put us on a flight the next day at exactly 24 hours later. There were a couple more flights going the next morning but the only thing they told us they could do is put us on a flight 24 hours later than the original flight. We had to pay for a hotel with our own money, which is understandable, since the weather was the fault. But not much help was given and the communication was just bad. A day later the next flight was delayed by 2 hours, but since were already onboard this was communicated by the pilot.",14th August 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Toronto,Aug-18,2,3,0,0,1,0,1,54

They ended up putting us on a Delta flight which was delightful. But, consequently they did not enter it properly in the computer and we were listed as a “no show” and our return flights were canceled. We did not receive a notification about this and did not know about anything till we arrived two weeks later for our return flight. We were blamed for the error saying we canceled the flights. When someone finally figured out the error they noted in the file that it was “canceled by agent” agent is what they call their computer system. But the inexperienced and unfriendly desk clerks read this as our travel agent canceling our flight. It took us 50 hours to get home running from gate to gate on standbys . We received 10 $10 meal vouchers for 6 people. But we each had to stand inline for 45 minutes to get them one at a time and each time we had to prove that we deserved them by showing all of our documentation on our canceled flights. Employees attitudes were inflammatory and the crews on the 5 flights we ended up taking seemed overworked and tired.

The Captain came into the Business Class section and introduced himself and told us he had been flying for Air Canada for over 25 years and said it was his pleasure to welcome us on Board.

543,decided to share his business class seat,Marie Hart,TripVerified,"  My husband and I travelled from Sydney to Chicago with a stop at Toronto. Hubby flew business class as his work paid for it, I flew economy. I attempted to get a business class seat two days after hubby, the price probably due to cookies had gone up $3000, so for a return ticket it went from $5000, to $8000 in two days. So I purchased an economy fare, Then I attempted to bid for an upgrade, I bid $2250, one way for an upgrade, that meant I would have paid $3250, one way. Initially Air Canada’s bid, as in it is a slider, was $3250, I moved the slider down to the lowest I could bid, coming up with $2250, one way. I received an email saying my bid was unsuccessful. So imagine my surprise to find empty seats in Business Class. So instead I purchase lounge access, which I paid fifty dollars. And got to use in Toronto. I found Air Canada’s lounge food is rubbish. Due to my unsuccessful bid to upgrade, Hubby and I decided to share his business class seat. However, on our leg home, one hostess was ok with it, whilst another hostess was downright abrupt and rude, claiming it was Air Canada’s policy that you can’t change seats. It wasn’t so much that the hostess made up a policy on the go, but it was her attitude demanding I get back to economy, yet she didn’t have anything to say to my husband upon his return, not one word. So do I recommend Air Canada, definitely not. ",5th August 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Toronto,Aug-18,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,55
544,problem in their system,Maryam Sabour,TripVerified,"  Toronto to San Francisco. Air Canada has a problem in their system where they can't get the spelling of my name right. Every time I make a booking the system deletes the last letter of my name ""Maryam"" becomes ""Marya"". Because of this, I can never check-in online at their system and with any booking I have to see an in person agent every time. As a frequent flyer for business, I am a NEXUS holder, never check baggage and always check-in online to avoid long waiting lines. However because of this problem I will forever have to get to airport early, and stand in line to have an agent correct my name on my boarding pass otherwise security will not let me through with the error on my boarding pass. Last week I flew to SFO from YYZ and Air Canada refused to let me bypass an-hour long line to have the change made and get on to my flight. They told me security would not have a problem letting me through but of course what happened? Security would not let me through and made me go back and stand in line for the Air Canada agent to change my name on the boarding pass. This is insane for an airline like Air Canada to not solve a problem that affects every person whose first name ends in the letter ""M"". They told me the system thinks that ""M"" stands for Mr. or Ms. so it gets mixed up. When I reached out to the Customer Relations team, after providing me with a 25% one time discount, told me they would not help me further, update me on whether this issue would ever be solved, or speak to me regarding this issue again.

545,a total disappointment,J Berchaur,TripVerified,"  My flight was canceled due to a technical failure. It was the last flight out of Boston so there was no alternative for the day. We ended up in a long queue and were at the counter shortly before midnight, only to be told that the next available flight is 2 days from now. We politely declined and asked them to organise a hotel. They said there's nobody to do it and we should do it ourselves and expense the money back. Now finding a hotel in the middle of the night in Boston can be a real adventure. We managed to do it and were as conscious of cost as possible. In the end Air Canada only wanted to reimburse us a 100$ total for the hotel stay. We paid way more. Although they didn't care about what happened to us they didn't even want to cover basic costs. It's now over 4 weeks and we haven't seen a penny. The ticket cost were supposed to get charged back to my card end of June. Nothing has arrived yet. The same happened with a Delta flight and I got my money back within a week.

Boeing 787 cabin is cramped, but that's typical across most carriers. App is hard to navigate, requiring me to reenter my name every time I open the app. Baggage was delayed 24 hours, and then delivered after midnight.

549,worst customer service ,Larry Adams,TripVerified,"  Quebec to Austin via Toronto. I was to fly out of Quebec this morning with a connection in Toronto to Austin, TX. The flight was about 30 minutes delayed before the gate agent mentioned anything. I was actually receiving email alerts from Air Canada before hearing anything from the gate agent about the delays. My flight from Quebec was delayed 7 hours which left me no way of making my connection in Toronto. I went to the gate agent in order to re-book my connection. She very quickly told me I would have to worry about it when I got to Toronto and there was nothing they could do for me. I waited around 2 more hours and went back to the same gate agent. I again asked about re-booking my connection. She then gave me a pamphlet and told me to call their 800 number. Called the 800 number and waited on hold for 30 minutes. When someone finally answered it hung up the call on me. I called back and waited 45 minutes on hold. The guy that answered told me there were no other flights for the day that would get me back to Austin and he asked me if I could travel tomorrow (as if I had a choice in the matter). I had paid for premium seats on my initial flights (sounds as though I am out that money). He put me on hold as he booked me for the following day flights (I was on hold at least 20 minutes). During this time I booked a nearby hotel for the night because the pamphlet I was given said the airline would not be responsible for costs related to travel interruptions because it was beyond their control. I went back to the gate agent. Told her after 1.5 hours on the phone that I had been re-booked for tomorrow and asked her about getting my luggage back. The only good thing she did all day was call down and had my luggage pulled off the plane. Gave me a $10 meal voucher to the only place to eat in the airport which of course had a line wait of no less than 45 minutes due to all of the other stranded passengers. She then said she could get me to Toronto today (but still would have to spend the night in Toronto). If she could do that why couldn’t she have re-booked me to begin with instead of having me wait on the phone for 1.5 hours? Supervisor standing behind her seemed as though she could care less as well. So here I sit in a hotel room at my expense in Quebec. I will have to fight the battle with them tomorrow that I have already paid $60 to check my luggage from yesterday. I am sure they are going to want me to pay that again. I will also have to pay for another day of parking at Austin.

However, after I booked my round-trip flights Edmonton to Shanghai via Vancouver, they changed my seat selection without notice. After I booked flights, selected seats and made payment, they sent me a confirmation email. In this email they changed all my seats to last row, but they didn't give me any heads-up and so I didn't find out. Today when I was re-organizing my email folder, I happened to see it.  Air Canada has thrown us to the last row. I just talked with their customer service agent, and he said the mistake was caused by flight changes. It is a lie because first of all they only changed domestic leg but all my seat selections including international legs have been changed; Secondly, it is only a departure time change (earlier departure), not equipment change. I can imagine how people will be disappointed and shocked when they arrive at airport and find out their selected seats are long gone.

The moment I got to the agent she said the flight was closed and she had to put me on a later flight but it was still 45 minutes before my flight was scheduled to take off so I asked for security. The woman at the counter was so rude and never apologized, she told me it was my fault.

Friendly and warm cabin crew, several rounds of drinks on 7 hour sectors, and announcements in both English and French. Top-notch service from this crew as they were able to get for you what you needed. The seat was relatively comfortable and the inflight entertainment system had plenty of good choices. No fuss boarding at both CDG and YYZ, and their mobile boarding pass was a huge time saver at busy airports such as CDG. If there was one thing I didn't like it would be their in-flight catering - strange choice of mains such as shredded carrots on pasta was not very delicious, and they ran out of second options on both flights. However, pre-landing snacks were delicious and the wine selection was excellent. Look forward to flying them again in future and hopefully by then they will change their menu.",23rd July 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Montreal,May-18,4,5,3,5,5,0,5,56

Excellent, well-designed, comfortable seat pods. Thoughtful menu and service throughout, very good entertainment choices and accessibility, TV screen well positioned and easy to use. Amenities were good, although on this 16 hour overnight flight some pyjamas would have been good - as other airlines often do. Cabin crew were mostly very good. Overall, a very comfortable and enjoyable flight.",18th July 2018,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Vancouver to Melbourne,Jul-18,5,4,5,5,3,0,4,56
559,Seat is extremely hard and uncomfortable,Christopher Neep,TripVerified," Vancouver to London Heathrow. Air Canada created much publicity about the greater comfort on their new Dreamliner, the Boeing 789. The reality is very different. Seat is extremely hard and uncomfortable. Pillow and blanket are thin and flimsy. Service and food on board were mediocre. Staff were mostly unsmiling. Dinner was a dish of dry, cubed chicken with a lurid, spicy sauce. Almost inedible. Arrived exhausted at LHR. Very disappointing. Air Canada’s Dreamliner is no dream to fly on.",17th July 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to London Heathrow,Jul-18,1,2,1,2,3,0,3,56

561,"good, comfortable flight",D Harrison,TripVerified," Flew Air Canada from Montreal to Dublin. A good, comfortable flight in a new B737 MAX aircraft, sitting in international premium economy (in this plane it's the same as AC's domestic business class). Service crew was friendly as usual and the flight itself was on time.

After 20 minutes of flight, the plane turns back and land back in Montreal. The flight is canceled. I spoke to 3 Air Canada employees and they all gave a different reason why the flight was canceled. I had to wait hours in line to schedule another flight. I wrote a complaint to the company and they refused to refund me for the money I lost for food and hostel. They gave me a discount on another flight and they even made it sound like it was a privilege. ",13th July 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Newark,Jun-18,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,57
564,The FA's were nice ,Leanne Bree,TripVerified,"  Booking with Air Canada, via Brisbane then Vancouver to Toronto. Initially they had me on a morning flight from Melbourne but I felt the time between flights was too tight, together with fog/winter issues so I called and arranged a flight the day before, it cost me an extra $300. The shock came at the airport when I found they downgraded me to economy, not a big issue except the $300 extra is more than a normal one way flight. Anyway determined to put this behind me, I used the kiosks at Brisbane airport to check in and self label my bags. The lounge (NZ) was really nice. Boarding was in zones with children going first, then zone 1-5 in order. The plane was a Boeing 787 with pods. Offered fruit juice or water and nuts to start, then handed menus. The FAs were nice but apart from meals, they were mostly absent, the meals were small but tasty. Then snacks (chips, water, chocolate and fruit) were left to help ourselves to. On the menu was a list of hot snacks on request. Meals were trolley service, like upmarket economy. Entertainment was ok, not extensive but adequate. The seat was a little hard but ok. Breakfast was nice although the FA gave me a lecture on sugar when I asked for milk and sugar in my coffee. After arrival in Vancouver and the necessary immigration procedure followed, it was off to domestic and the lounge. Stayed there just a few minutes, it was crowded, inadequate, little to offer, so I just walked around until the Toronto flight. Old plane, again boarded via zones. The food on board was dire. The nice FA offered me alternatives, I just opted for a cookie. The entertainment in board was better than the Dreamliner. All in all the domestic was the better flight but neither as good as the Asian carriers",13th July 2018,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Toronto via Vancouver,Jul-18,3,3,2,2,3,0,3,57
565,found my luggage was lost,B Neale,TripVerified,"  My flight was leaving at 4pm. Flight AC119. We boarded ok, then was told to deplane due to air con issues. It was delayed half hour. Then another half hour and so on. I was supposed to have a 5 hr layover in Vancouver but time was creeping away until it became obvious I’d miss my Melbourne flight. Lining up at the counter with many others and only one staff member dealing with us including a large tour group that took up over an hour. The AC lady called for help but none came. A young man came to her but refused to help anyone. What shocking service, or lack thereof. I was then put on another Vancouver flight then onto Sydney and Melbourne. On arrival in Vancouver I approached the desk for an earlier Syd-Melb flight than 1.30pm. They said there were none. On my iPad I showed them how many Qantas flights there actually were yet they refused to budge. This was all their mistake and it was compounding. The plane to Sydney was old. The entertainment was less than any other international flight I’d ever flown. They asked for headphones about an hour before landing, The FAs on board were friendly. In Sydney I found my luggage was lost. Do I regret booking with Air Canada - you bet. Never again, I’d go Cathay or China Southern which are so much better next time.",13th July 2018,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Toronto to Melbourne via Vancouver,Jul-18,2,3,2,1,1,0,1,57
566,My bag did not make it,Shane Passarelli,TripVerified,"  My bag did not make it despite over a two hour connection and other passengers that checked in their bag in at the exact time. The airline never bothered to follow up with me to let me know the bag had arrived. After originally telling them it was urgent, they reverted to using a bag delivery service. I had to incur the expense and aggravation of picking the bag up at the airport via Uber.",12th July 2018,Business,Economy Class,Montreal to Los Angeles,Jul-18,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,57
567,delayed my bags,S Andrews,TripVerified," Air Canada has delayed my bags on five separate occasions. Once on a trip to Halifax, once on a trip to Las Vegas and this is the third time they have done it on my trip to Italy. Halifax and Las Vegas were both five day trips, I spent the first three days of these trips without baggage. I understood that because I made connections that it is possible there was not enough time to properly get the bag onto the next flight. However, if this is something that often happens maybe it is best they stop charging for connections they do not have the capability of properly executing. This most recent flight to Milan, I checked in 4 hours early for a direct flight. There is absolutely no reason my baggage should have been left in Toronto. This is my third day in Italy without my baggage, how has it still not made it on another flight? I am writing a review on here because the customer service website for Air Canada is insufficient, there is no direct email for customer service, instead they lead you to numerous automated responses. Working in customer service myself, I understand that mistakes happen. However, considering I have given this company thousands of dollars over the last few years I am fed up. I see no reason why in 2018 they can charge $1,200 for a round trip, direct flight to Milan and be so behind that baggage cannot arrive with that flight. I am ready to ditch Air Canada completely and give another company my money. Hopefully this message catches their attention, please make your customer service page more accessible if you want reviews to come directly to you with the chance to make up for this tiring experience instead of being posted to the public.",12th July 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Milan,Jul-18,1,2,2,3,1,1,1,57
568,flight was now cancelled,W Chilton,TripVerified,"  We had a short 1.5 hour flight from Vancouver to Calgary with a quick 30 min. layover in Kelowna. We got off the plane, and the next flight was delayed (we were suppose to board the same plane, but just pick up some passengers in Kelowna.) They come on the intercom and say the plane is broken so we need to call a number to re-book our flight to Calgary or get a partial refund. (Yes, it was our responsibility now.) We needed to get to a wedding reception, so time was of the essence. All 4 of us were on the phone trying to re-book the next flight, and we were put on hold. And hold. And hold. Then they came back saying they got us tickets, then put us on hold again. Finally came back and said ""sorry the next flight is now full"", but they have a flight leaving in a few hours with a layover in Edmonton and to arrive in Calgary around 9pm. We needed to get there so we jumped on that flight before it was full, we got new boarding passes, and went to sit at White Spot for some drinks. We waited about 2.5 hours and then that flight was now delayed. About an hour later they told us that the flight was now cancelled. So we just wasted hours in the airport waiting for nothing. We tried calling customer service but there were no more flights that evening and the next one was at 7:30 in the morning. FWe had called to ask for a refund so that we could jump on a flight with WestJet, but they said that was ""unlikely"" to happen. So now we were trying to get hotel vouchers, nobody would give us any sort of solid information. Every person we talked to told us to go talk to another person, or to call a different number. One guy had told us that all their hotel vouchers were ""exhausted"". So not only did they royally screw us for the entire day and night, but we weren't even going to get any sort of accommodation. The only good person we dealt with was an amazing lady who finally pulled some strings to get us a hotel, and she was helpful and knowledgeable. If anything goes wrong they make you fend for yourselves when having to re-schedule your flights in a city you are unfamiliar with.

569,all went above and beyond,K Leesen,TripVerified,"  I want to give a shout out and Kudos to the Air Canada staff in Paris and in Montreal. Our flight #881 from Paris to Toronto was delayed 8 hours due to weather. Once in Toronto we had another 4 hour drive back to Michigan. Staff at the ticket/customer service desk in Paris was awesome getting us moved to an earlier flight to Montreal then to Toronto. Once in Montreal, the staff were so helpful. Air Canada did not have to help us at all. They could have made us wait for the 9:00 pm flight, sitting in the Paris Airport for 12 hours then the flight and drive home. They all went above and beyond. The three of us were tired and confused but the staff came through! Thank you so much! Maybe if I had flown Air Canada to Paris to begin with, my luggage would not have been lost by Brussels Airlines! Whole trip - no luggage! This was my first time flying with Air Canada and would recommend them in the future.",12th July 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Toronto,Jul-18,4,5,4,5,5,5,4,57
570,delay was due to weather,G Streeter,TripVerified,"  My flight was more than 20 minutes delayed from YYC to YQR. We then had to divert to YXE due to what the crew described as a fast-moving storm that was going through YQR. As a result, I missed my connecting flight to YYZ. Staff at YQR rebooked me for 6.00 am the next day, but offered nothing else as compensation. No hotel accommodation, meals, upgrade, nothing. They said that the delay was due to weather, not the delay of their flight crew in YYC. I will not use Air Canada again.

She said ""Oh it is delicious"", opens the can, hands it to me, and moves on to the next row. A few minutes later she returns with the credit card machine. I was not informed that the drink was alcoholic, nor that it cost money, nor did I even request to have the drink."" After a rather threatening discussion on the flight attendant's behalf, I agreed to pay for the drink and contacted customer service instead. Customer service  informed me that I would have known the prices of all of their service offerings had I read their 18 page menu, and that I should know better than to order alcoholic drinks that I don't want to pay for.",10th July 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edmonton to Toronto,Jul-18,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,58

If you don’t have the planes flying don’t sell the tickets! Every time I’m delayed hours. Haven’t had one reliable Air Canada Jazz flight to Grande Prairie in the last 8 times flown.

The day I was flying back to Melbourne, my flight to Vancouver was delayed by 2 hours losing my connecting flight to Melbourne.

Staff was okay, not super friendly, not rude. Flight prices were average. In air service is very basic — water, soda, juice are about the only complementary items. My only serious complaint was a 20-minute delay on the tarmac when the cabin became extremely warm. No comment or explanation. I would use Air Canada if it suited my schedule but I would not seek them out.",9th July 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Toronto,Jul-18,4,2,2,1,2,1,3,58
575,passport slightly water damaged,Brit DalCais,TripVerified,"  Myself and my boyfriend planed a trip to Iceland and booked it with Air Canada. The way we were treated last night July 2nd 2018 flying at 23:20 flight to Reykavik flight number AC 816 was my worst experience with an airline. My boyfriends passport is slightly water damaged, but scans where we go. It has never not scanned until last night, but it wouldn't scan at the terminal. But what I'm having a hard time understanding is why were we stopped outside of the US? So we flew from NY to Toronto no problem, passport scanned and was accepted by Air Cananda staff. And then we are about to board in Toronto to go to Reykjavik and its no longer acceptable , why were we allowed to enter into Canada? So we proceeded to try to talk to the women who told us she couldn't do any thing because it wouldn't scan. And proceeded to tell us to go to customer service to see what can be done.  So we have to leave the terminal and go through border control, so my boyfriend hands over his passport to the  man working the counter, and now my boyfriends passport will scan. The young gentleman at the booth suggested she wasn't holding it on the machine long enough for it to read. So she refused us for a $2000 flight we booked. At this point its 24:00, we had been at Toronto airport for 6 hours because of delays. We need to go to customer service, rebook the flight, get a hotel and get our luggage. We go to customer service and had the best customer service thank god! The staff there was amazing and super helpful. So we go to get our luggage and its almost 0200, so they have no one there get our luggage and now we have to go to the airport today and hope it didn't go to Reykjavik because we obviously did not rebook the flight with Air Canada.

Once I got to my gate they told me it has been closed but it was delayed for an emergency but I couldn't enter the plane. At this point I'm too tired to argue with person at the desk so I just tell them to put me on the next flight to LA. The next flight came hours later it was a nice plane service was great. My major issue with this airline happened with the baggage delay and how they handled it. As of now, a day after I landed and my carry on didn't.

578,helped me get home safely,S Nadler,NotVerified,"  Recently, I was supposed to fly from Toronto City (YTZ) to Pittsburgh (PIT) via Montreal (YUL). I had originally bought that flight since it was cheaper, even though nonstop flights were available. I made a dumb mistake and went to the Toronto Pearson airport (YYZ) instead. Those airport codes are just so similar! Feeling confused after not seeing my flight, I was sent to the ticketing desk to sort everything out. The woman who helped me told me what had happened and was very understanding. She was able to change my flight to YYZ and put me on a nonstop flight to PIT. She did charge me a same day flight change fee, but in my opinion, this was well worth it.

579,I am extremely unsatisfied,E Dutton,TripVerified,"  Houston to Vancouver via Calgary. We received several itineraries by email. I didn't realize that each one of these was an itinerary change. The last one moved our flight time up from 7:10 to 6:30am. Having 2 small children, we got to the ticket counter at 5:35 am which was plenty of time for our first flight time, but they would not let us on the flight because we missed the 1 hour check in by 5 minutes. The lady at the counter was unhelpful and rude. I called the rebooking number and they said there was another flight that same day (the lady at the counter said there wasn't). The rep on the phone said we need to book with the lady at the counter because it would cost much more if she did it on the phone. I went back to the lady at the counter and she was still completely unhelpful even when talking to the rep on the phone. The rep on the phone spoke with her supervisor who gave it to us at the same price because the rep at the counter refused to help. $450 later and hauling 2 very young children around at 4:30 am for no reason because our flight was changed without real notification (the email never stated there was an itinerary change that I noticed), I am extremely unsatisfied. Flight home- My husband was detained by US Dept of Homeland Security. While this was not the fault of Air Canada, it took them almost 2 hours to get them his bags to be checked. He almost missed this flight as well and I was in the airport in Calgary for over 2 hours with 2 small children by myself because of this delay. This was my husband's first time to fly. It was not mine, but I can say that it was by far my most stressful. Between the cost in money and stress, I don't think I will ever fly Air Canada again.",25th June 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Vancouver via Calgary,Jun-18,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,58
580,unable to get any premium seats,Henry Reis,Not Verified,"Vancouver to Montreal. This was my first time flying with a child. I have a 6-month-old son and my wife and I decided to pay extra to get premium economy seats and take advantage of more leg room and seats that would allow us to leave the plane quicker. As soon as I received an online confirmation of my purchase, I went on their website to select the premium seats, on their website. Every  time I selected the premium seats I wanted to use and hit 'confirm seat selection', the website would take me to another page, and then timed out my request. I tried to complete this procedure  11 times, to no avail. I then thought I might not be able to get the premium seats I want, but at least I have premium seats, so I'll try the regular check-in 24 hours before departure. To my surprise, I was unable to get any premium seats at all and no one could see on the system that I had paid for premium seats. The check-in staff then told me that there was no premium economy in that flight, just business or regular economy. That was a lie, as I found out as soon as I entered the plane. I almost went back to the counter to discuss why would they lie to me so I could just get in the plane and take the seat they assigned me instead of what I had paid for. I mean, think about it. If you pay for business and wait until you reach the airport to complete the check-in, you might not have a say in which seat you'll get, but you'll have a business seat. Same goes for first class, and one would think the same would apply to premium economy but apparently you can pay over $100/px for what they call the 'comfort package', and they don't care to hold the seat for you. The very least they could have done is to upgrade my wife and I to business, as there were empty seats there. Now I had to call customer service and spend over one hour for them to guarantee us on the premium seats on our return flight, but I am still expecting a full refund for the premium seats I was denied despite having paid for them.",25th June 2018,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Vancouver to Montreal,Jun-18,1,1,1,3,1,0,1,59

582,the lack of a dedicated FA,John Doig,TripVerified,"  Dublin to Toronto. I had not flown before in the new Premium Economy of Air Canada, although I had done so on several occasions with AC Rouge leisure subsidiary including on this route, before it was ‘transferred’ back to main-line AC. Check-in at DUB was problem free and expeditious as PE passengers can use the Premium lines. When this service was operated by AC Rouge PE passengers were directed to use DUB Fast Track security. This perk not offered on main-line AC. Boarding was as expected, PE being the second group to board after Business class. The flight appeared full, all seats were occupied in the PE section. The seats were a little more comfortable than those on Premium Rouge with perhaps a little more leg room. As this service departed DUB early afternoon, lunch was serviced not long after departure. There were 2 choices for the main course and the meal was serviced on china ware. No so the drinks with plastic glasses, (apart form a wine glass on the meal tray!) and coffee/tea from paper cups. This is a downgrade from Rouge PE where real glasses and china mugs for coffee/tea are used. The second meal or snack was exactly the same as offered in Premium Rouge. A significant difference was the lack of a dedicated FA to PE. FAs in PE are shared with Economy, with Economy being a much larger cabin, at times there was no FA to be seen in PE. With Rouge PE there is dedicated FA at all times. Another difference is that the FAs on main-line are more mature, and for the most part more experienced. The flight arrived on time and dis-embarkation was as expected, PE exited followed Business class passengers. Based this experience, I found the AC PE service inferior to that of the nearest comparison, international Premium Rouge.",22nd June 2018,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,DUB to YYZ,May-18,4,3,3,4,4,3,3,59

587,very slow to solve the situation,Michelle Ratton,TripVerified," I had my flight cancelled today, and I (and all other passengers) had the following difficulties: 1) The flight was cancelled by email before being announced as cancelled. That caused a strong misdundertanding among passengers and the ground crew for about half an hour. 2) The flight was rescheduled to 8am. It was a late flight (11.15 pm) and they were very slow to solve the situation. Therefore, a group of people could not go to the hotel and got stuck in the airport. The group of about 20 people had to stay outside the security area from 2am until 4am with CAN30 for dinner and brekfast meals. 3) No alternative to these passengers was presented. 4) Air Canada shamily sent an email with a promocode to be used in the next 60 days, otherwise it will expire. This promo could not be used for upgrade on a next flight. So useless for one from abroad, and not a frequent flyer of AC! 5) The ground crew were badly trained, and once very stressed they were not of great assistance to help people leave the security area nor to figure out alternatives.",12th June 2018,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Toronto to Sao Paulo,Jun-18,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,59

This time my complaint is their nickel & diming policies and unwillingness to accommodate passengers. I'm on my way from Montreal to Calgary, but transferring in Vancouver. I asked at check-in if there might be room for me on a more direct flight. There was, but Air Canada wasn't going to let me have it without charging another $75 on top of my ticket price. (Bearing in mind I've also just paid $25 extra for my one piece of regular size & weight luggage). My ticket has been paid for, the seats on the direct flight are available. It should really make no difference to AC, except they would have a happier customer if they would show a bit of flexibility and stop being so smug with all their extra fees.",5th June 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Calgary via Vancouver,Jun-18,3,3,1,2,2,0,3,59
590,best in 15 years of flying with AC,M Gardner,TripVerified," Regina to Toronto. I fly Air Canada a lot for work. This flight I got an upgrade to business class. The service was the best I had in 15 years of flying with AC. The flight attendant was Korean - and in true Asian Airline hospitality style - toward the end of the flight he went to each and every customer, bowed down and thanked us for our business. Really above and beyond! Not saying this is something that is expected but really blew my mind considering the normal level of service which is good either way. The wifi was bad though.",4th June 2018,Business,Business Class,Regina to Toronto,Jun-18,5,5,5,5,5,2,5,60
591,otherwise very solid product,Claudio Rallo,TripVerified,"  Amsterdam to Ottawa via Frankfurt. The Lufthansa flight from Amsterdam to Frankfurt which I was originally scheduled to take had gotten cancelled, and I got booked on a later flight without receiving any prior notification. Due to this flight change my connecting time in Frankfurt became extremely tight and so I needed to run to catch my Air Canada flight to Ottawa. When I arrived at the gate nearly everyone had already boarded so it was just myself and a few other latecomers who got there last minute. As far as the flight goes, it didn't differ much from my previous experiences with Air Canada. The food in economy class was horrible, save for the pretzel snacks and the chicken wrap they give out towards the end of the flight. The food in economy class is a major flaw of an otherwise very solid product, and I suggest Air Canada's partner Lufthansa to promptly inform passengers of any cancellations/delays.",4th June 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Ottawa via Frankfurt,May-18,4,4,1,4,4,0,4,60
592,I would fly with them again,W Reade,TripVerified,"  Tokyo to Vancouver. First time flying Boeing 787 and loved it. We where seated in 26J and 26K. Boarding was slow. The seat was comfortable, the cabin crew were wonderful, the in-flight entertainment was good, could be a little broader but cannot complain. The food was rubbish. We ate in the airport before the flight and glad we did. All in all I would fly with them again.",3rd June 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Vancouver,May-18,4,5,1,5,4,0,4,60
593,cancelled without warning or reason,V Kan,TripVerified," My flight from New York to Toronto was cancelled without warning or reason. There was no inclement weather. No apologies given, the airline staff were rude, did not apologize and acted like this happens very often (it probably does given the poor record of LGA airport). I got rebooked on a much later flight, missing an important meeting. The airline staff didn't care about that at all. In this day and age, the least an airline can do is offer some sort of apology or compensation. I've had better experiences in the past, which is why I did not give them a lower rating. Will be doing my best to avoid this airline from now on, unfortunately, I am Canadian.",24th May 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Toronto,May-18,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,60
594,pay to change to an earlier flight,G Realen,TripVerified,"  Boston to Montreal. We arrived 4 hours earlier for our flight. There were 2 earlier flights available for us to board before our scheduled flight. First attendant at the check in said upon our inquiring that there were no earlier flights available, but there were 2 earlier flights. She didn’t even bother checking. We decided to ask the attendant through security instead. He mentioned we would have to pay 200 USD to change to an earlier flight. Interestingly, I travel with Air Canada for work frequently and this was the first time they indicated I would have to pay to move my flight earlier. We decided to try our luck a third time with a different attendant. This one didn’t even let us finish asking our question and immediately said it wasn’t possible while discussing an unrelated topic with a colleague of hers. Terrible service. We can understand that some accomodations may not always be logistically possible but in this case it feels like we weren’t even being considered. Not a trademark of a customer centric company.",18th May 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Montreal,May-18,3,1,0,0,1,0,1,60
595,unacceptable seat pitch,P Wipatavit,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Vancouver on AC101 on a full Boeing 777-300ER. Check in at Pearson wasn't busy but the staff at the bag drop area had such a rude attitude that made for an unpleasant start to the trip. Boarding was a complete mess, as they were boarding a 400-seater aircraft through a relatively small gate, with no real division for the Economy Class zone boarding normally found for international flights. Because of this, the line clogged the entire walkway of the terminal with people. A lot of bags had to be gate checked due to the full flight, thus, delaying the boarding even further. None the less, the flight departed and arrived on time. The seat, while acceptable for its width, has an unacceptable seat pitch. I couldn't imagine spending more than three hours in that seat, even the thought of bearing a 13-hour flights AC's 777-300ER flies on. The crew was slow but courteous, serving a full flight. Only drinks were complimentary for this flight. Entertainment selection was sufficient for the domestic flight, with some movies only having trailers available for some reason. Overall, not a happy customer and if I were to fly on the same route again, at the same price point I would pick WestJet over Air Canada, having flown the former on the return trip.",15th May 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Vancouver,May-18,2,4,2,3,1,0,3,60
596,flight attendants are attentive,S Norton,TripVerified," This flight from London Heathrow to Toronto was typical of Air Canada.

597,the worst experience,G Leane,TripVerified,"  Houston to Toronto. I am very unhappy with the services provided by Air Canada. I had previously checked in online the night before. I came by the check-in desk to make sure I did not need to do anything further prior to proceeding through the security gates. I was then asked if I had any bags to check. I said, ""No, but I have this bag I am carrying on."" The lady at the check-in then stated, ""Place it in that"", pointing to the airport carry-on sizer/fitter. I did, and it fit perfectly. She then stated, ""Well, sir, the flight is full. You will need to check it."" I asked if there was any way to not check it as I had my suit in it for a conference I was attending. She looked at me and said, ""No"". She then placed tag on the bag, and then stated, ""That will be 25 dollars."" I looked at her incredulously and said, ""Excuse me? Just because the flight is full is not a reason to assess me a 25 dollar penalty. That is Air Canada's issue and not mine. I did not sign anything saying I agreed to this penalty"". I then asked for her manager which was ""busy"". I then said I would wait for the manager. However, after 15 minutes, the manager did not arrive. I  proceeded to take my bag through security as initially planned, and everything was fine. I proceeded to the gate at which point I was told that what she said was not true, and I should not be assessed any fees. In addition, I called Air Canada Customer Service, and they also agreed I should not be assessed any fees for a bag that meets the requirements of a carry on but has to be checked due to a full flight. This is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline, and I will never choose to fly Air Canada again.",6th May 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Toronto,May-18,1,2,2,0,1,0,1,60
598,rebooking process was difficult,C Kan,TripVerified,"  My flight from Toronto to Boston is canceled due to the weather. While there is no way to tell Mother Nature  there are better way to handle customer service. The website for refund and rebooking did not work for me and you can only transact with them on the phone for this matter not the counter. But I was on the waiting line for probably an hour and no one picked up the phone. In addition to this incident, I was flying from Toronto to Halifax and many of the customers were caught up in the security line due to “unforeseen” (from customers point of view) crowd at the check in and security check. We missed the gate by probably 2 minutes? Can still see the plane on tarmac but it’s deemed as customer fault and we were told to rebook. The rebooking process was similarly difficult. Not sure why their online systems have not been revamped.

599,Horrible customer service,C Janzen,TripVerified,"  Las Vegas to Toronto. Did not have enough over head storage for everyone's carry-on baggage so after boarding was an hour delayed, I had to wait at the door to the plane (literally at the door!) with numerous other people so they could hand write and print bag check tickets. My luggage got damaged and the airline won't do anything about it, they're also refusing to reply to my emails now.

Over 3 hours delay in Casablanca, the service on the plane is the worst in long flight not to mention the quality of the meal.

We desperately needed our bags as we traveling to Grand Forks and leaving for a Comox by vehicle the following day. Nichole was kind enough to immediately contact couriers in Grand Forks to ensure that we would receive our luggage as soon as it arrived from Vancouver. We understand that luggage gets lost from time to time, but it is never convenient. Our whole family thanks you, as we were in Grand Forks to help elderly parents move to Vancouver Island and time was of the essence.

The meals in First class were tasty, combined with a choice of wines. The seats were comfortable. I noticed some upgrades on the amenity kit and a small matress was provided for the seat on the return leg. Overall Air Canada has a competitive business Class product.

There was no welcome drink, no warm towel. No amenities and no menu. Food was tasteless chicken in a plastic disk. There was offering of drinks and wine. No 2nd drink offering. There was no snacks during flight, when I went to the galleys, the only that they could offer me were some crackers. For breakfast they offer only a piece of cake and coffee. Flight attendants were nice but old. The company should place younger staff on long flights instead of the YUL-YYZ route. The flight on YUL-YYZ was on A330 and they served only juices and coffee, you had to pay for food. IFE was ok.",21st April 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Munich,Apr-18,4,2,2,3,4,3,5,61
605,unimpressed and disappointed,S Farmer,TripVerified,"  Edmonton to Halifax via Toronto. What started out as a very pleasant experience as a nice young man in Edmonton moved us up to nicer seats that were together, quickly became a disaster of an experience. After boarding our flight in Toronto and sitting on the runway for over an hour we were told we must leave the plane as it isn’t safe to fly. We were then told we would have to wait another 2 and a half hours until our next flight, ruining our dinner and holiday plans for the evening. After being told we would be leaving at 530 for sure from Pearson I was again frustrated to find we weren’t even boarding until 530, and then got to sit yet again on the runway for over an hour while the flight crew figured everything out. This entire experience was very frustrating, a terrible way to start a holiday and was made worse by the lack of compensation for our time and frustration by Air Canada, no food vouchers, or drinks were offered and nothing more than an explanation every 45 minutes was given. I am extremely unimpressed and disappointed, as I continue to sit on the runway still waiting to take off at some undetermined time.",21st April 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edmonton to Halifax via Toronto,Apr-18,2,1,0,0,1,1,2,61
606,incompetent handling delays,L Walsh,TripVerified,"  I understand that there can be delays. Air Canada is incompetent in effectively handling delays in particular for business travelers. There are a lot of negative reviews of Air Canada for everything from overall friendliness to food. I care about those things – but as a business traveler I care most about getting to my destination on time, and that delays are handled effectively and knowledgeably when there are disruptions so that I can still get to my destination as needed. I was flying from Pittsburgh to Shanghai via Toronto. My flight was delayed to Toronto, causing me to miss my flight to Shanghai. There were two other flights that could have gotten me to Shanghai in time for my meeting. Due to the incompetence of the Air Canada staff I missed both. In particular, there is no Business Class line at the re-ticketing counter. I waited for an hour and a half – missing both other flight options. I was behind domestic travelers with multiple rerouting options and coach fares. Even when I called over a “supervisor” and explained the situation I was told there was nothing she could do, she couldn’t get me to the front of the line, and I would just have to wait my turn. I was going for a board meeting, with my executive team flying in from all over the world for this meeting. All other travel and arrangements – for all of the other people – needed to be rearranged due to my travel issues. I am a frequent Air Canada traveler. I go to Asia at a minimum twice a year in Business Class. I fly every other week on an expensive (typically $500) ticket to my other office domestically. When I called ""Customer Service"" they were rude, told me there was no management escalation (no way I could talk to a supervisor), and showed absolutely no flexibility. My experience with customer service just added insult to injury. I am taking the time to write this review on as many review sites as I can. I don’t typically write reviews. In this case, however, I really want to warn other business travelers – in particular overseas business travelers – that they are not at all equipped to handle the inevitable travel disruptions and prioritize business class tickets. And that’s in addition to the relatively uncomfortable business class seats, poor customer service, and bad food.",20th April 2018,Business,Business Class,Pittsburgh to Shanghai via Toronto,Mar-18,3,2,3,3,1,1,1,61
607,said I need to cooperative,N Drage,TripVerified,  Toronto to Las Vegas. I got to the gate and was told I can’t bring my carry on on board because the plane was full.

609,sleeping on the hard floors,C Mealan,TripVerified,"  Toronto to New York La Guardia. First they changed the gate without announcing it last minute. A bunch of us missed the flight and it was our fault (they say). Second flight was cancelled due to weather which I understand. But the way the ground staff handled it was so unprofessional. Air Canada cancelled my flight 3 times. I was at Pearson international from Friday to Sunday sleeping on the hard floors cause they don’t reimburse for hotels if your a local, meaning anywhere in Canada. Onn the Sunday the manager happen to put me on a flight out. I got on the flight when I landed in La Guardia my bags were not on the plane it’s been 3 days now. The call centre in india can’t locate my bags and the Canadian # doesn’t work due to high call volumes. I’ve missed my international connection twice, with no bags. I will never ever fly or use Air Canada ever again. ",17th April 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to New York La Guardia,Apr-18,1,2,0,0,1,0,1,61
610,flights were canceled upon arrival,S Lang,TripVerified,"  Seoul to Minneapolis via Toronto. Once we arrived at the Toronto Airport, the staff there were so unorganized. They had really bad attitudes & when we asked for directions, the first thing this woman did was questioned us why we were there & told us to go back to the direction where we came from. Coming back from my international destination, when everyone was seated in the plane, it was announced that there were “technical” issues & we would have to sit in the plane for 45 minutes. Well, that turned to an hour & half. Even worst was dealing with flight attendants for 13 hours. Our landing was postponed for an hour due to technical issues and the weather condition. Majority of travelers' flights were canceled upon arrival, and the people at Toronto Pearson (Terminal 1) were helpless. There was no one directing people to where they needed to go for assistance. The lines started to get long at Gate 15 at departures but there was absolutely no one to direct people where to line up or answer questions. We waited at the phone line for 1.5 hour just to wait another hour to speak with a representative. Getting impatient, I ended up at the hotel line for 2 hours just to find out it was to book a hotel when we just wanted to rebook our cancelled flight. Once we got to the Air Canada counter, the lady didn’t even care to look anything up on her computer & just told us to call this number that didn’t even work because it had “reach capacity.” Basically, the only help most of the 300+ travelers got were from other travelers. Also, this worker came onto the intercom to announce to us that they are doing their best to help us. Following that announcement came some short responses from frustrated travelers.  We spent the night at the airport and they closed Gate 15 down & turned people away. When I asked about the hotel vouchers, the man questioned me & my intentions instead of help, there was no one floating around to help travelers with cancelled flights.

611,Worst airline I’ve flown on,D Vage,TripVerified,  Montreal to New York LGA. Ridiculous transfer flight manipulation. Made me miss my flight because of 2 hour delay sitting in plane for de-icing and waiting for other customers on a transfer flight to board. But why didn’t they wait for us? Seriously looking at their bottom line and not caring for the customer at all. They cancelled at least half a dozen flights from Toronto to NYC because of freezing rain but there was absolutely no urgency to fly folks out in the morning so those flying at night got stuck with completely booked flights. I actually had a nonstop flight booked but 7 minutes later they kicked me out of my spot for no reason.

612,service was below average,D Leene,TripVerified,"  St John's to Sydney via Toronto / Vancouver. I was travelling for several hours. In Toronto crew suggested I ask for 3-4 seats together when I got to Vancouver as the flight was not full. In Vancouver I was given 3 seats in a row but just my luck it was 3 seats where you could not raise the arm rests. There was however in the back row 2-4-2 which were empty. The crew had put their bags in the row with 4 seats. When requested to find a place to sleep I was told to look around the plane. The crew used the seats to put their bags and sit during the flight to do crosswords. The service was below average, staff looked tired and 'service' was not on top of their list. They need to either retire, do short flights or retrain with some of the Asian airlines. Food was terrible. I was ticketed as an international flight from Toronto to Sydney but was expected to pay for food and 3.50 for cheap headphones that would cost them 20 cents. Air Canada needs to have a good look at themselves. They bring Star Alliance down.",15th April 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St John's to Sydney via Toronto / Vancouver,Apr-18,2,1,2,2,2,0,2,62
613,a subject of itinerary change,V Geetham,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Wellington via Sydney. I booked the ticket for my mother to travel Wellington, New Zealand from Vancouver, Canada. I booked in mid-February to travel in April beginning. My mother is old and has limited English. So i want her to travel hassle free for her vacation. The reason I choose air Canada 1) Price wise i can save about 150$ compared to the next cheap flight 2) I don't want to transit at Auckland because she needs to take a bus between international arrival and local departure at Auckland. 3) Air Canada's transit at Sydney only 3 hours and she can clear the bags at Wellington. My mother is Canadian and she doesn't require an ETA or transit visa to Australia if she has less than 8 hours transit. Exactly two days before the travel, we have received an email from Air Canada with a subject of itinerary change. No information inside the email except the itinerary. As per the new itinerary, transit at Sydney become 10 hours from just 3.5 hours. Same day evening we called the Air Canada to seek the reason. The person came to the phone didn't tell the reason. He just says the transit changed. Then we request for accommodation but he refused. Finally, we request the food voucher as a compensation for their possible mistake. He said they can provide that at the airport. ultimately its a useless conversation for us.( Nothing provided at the airport at the end.) Then only we realized my mother required an ETA or transit visa to Australia. Transit visa is free but it could take up to 5 days to get it. So we apply for ETA and luckily we received almost immediately. As per there website, this could take up to 12 hours sometime. We were not happy about Air Canada's behavior. So on the same day, we file a complaint with Air Canada and asked them to reply immediately since the next day my mother was flying. It is now almost 5 days and my mother in New Zealand for 3 days. But no reply from Air Canada until now. Money wise we are not losing anything but this was making us nervous. Unnecessary stress. Especially my mother. 150$ is lots of money. But I think next time I won't worry about even 500$. ",10th April 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Wellington via Sydney,Apr-18,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,62

617,irritated with this policy,Gabriel Lam,TripVerified,"  My review is specific to Air Canada's purchasing policy and not my flight experience. I purchased a ticket for my wife and I from Toronto to Calgary for a friend's wedding in June 2017. One of our family members passed away and as a result we needed to cancel our flight. We weren't able to obtain a full refund (due to their policy) which is understandable. I was, given a credit of a fraction of what I paid which I was told on the phone twice by different customer reps that will not expire. A series of family circumstances occurred which prevented my ability to fly. After 1 year, I decided to book a flight only to discover that my credit has expired. I emailed and appealed my case to their retention department and all they gave me was a 15% discount on my next flight. They even had the audacity to say it's out of their ""goodwill"" that they're offering me 15%.

When boarding at 16:05, the boarding gate staff said the flight was full, put us on 18:20. If you did not have seat why would you check us in. We could just walk out and spend time outside airport, instead of sitting for nothing for hours inside this small airport. We are still waiting now. Also, we could not buy anything from Quebec airport duty free, because of connecting flight, must buy in Toronto airport. Just wonder how a passenger could have enough time during short transit!

619,very reluctant to help me,Peter Marsland,TripVerified,"  London to Havana via Toronto. The flights were fine. The staff were efficient and pleasant on board. However, prior to travel I contacted customer services by email for basic information about whether the airline covers the cost of the Cuban visa card and airport taxes (they do). They were very reluctant to help me. Customer Services actually told me they only deal with customers after flights have taken place! Eventually my travel agent gave me a telephone number to contact the carrier, and I got the information I needed. On the Toronto to Havana flight both ways with Air Canada rouge, no meal was provided, which came as a surprise on a scheduled flight. In Toronto, Air Canada ground staff were very dismissive and unhelpful when we sought information on baggage. Havana check in told us we needed to retrieve bags at Toronto, even though the baggage tag showed check in through to destination. Air Canada staff seemed unable to give clear guidance. Two members of staff told us to reclaim the baggage, but could not tell us what to do when we had reclaimed it. I had great difficulty getting another member of staff to focus on my question: she just wanted to turn away from me. Compared to travel with other national carriers recently, Air Canada was poor.

They change planes at the last minute which can cause all sorts of confusion at the gate,  they told everyone that their carry on bags will not fit the new plane and they must be checked in. They could just sky check the bags and all would be okay, but they stopped that service also (second flight in two weeks they have done this to me on). They told us because it is a Q400 that they have to check in all the roller bags - this causes all sorts of delays upon arrival into Vancouver and is problematic if you have a connection due to a late inbound AC flight that delayed you to start with! The thing is, the sky check bags end up in the same place as the checked bags. Its just far more convenient for the business traveler to get your bag plane side and run to you connection.

621,Air Canada cancels this flight,Tara Bradley-Steck,TripVerified,"  Pittsburgh to Barbados via Toronto. Air Canada has a regularly scheduled 7am flight from Pittsburgh to Toronto that connects with many flights headed to the Caribbean. In our case, on Feb. 4 we intended to connect with a flight to Barbados, from where we would take a short flight to Union Island in the Grenadines and then a short ferry to Palm Island. Problem is: Air Canada cancels this flight - and not infrequently. On this day, Air Canada cited the reason as lack of crew. Really? You can't schedule adequate crew? And Air Canada didn't tell us it canceled the flight until we were on our way to the airport at 5 a.m. What are we to do then? In our case, we had only one other option, which was to buy a last-minute ticket on JetBlue via Fort Lauderdale for $772. Unfortunately, the flight got us in too late to make the connection to Union Island, which means we had to pay for a hotel in Barbados and repurchase the $285 non-refundable airfare to Union Island -- not to mention forfeit the first night at our final destination. Air Canada doesn't compensate you for the cancellation, other than to refund the original one-way ticket. They gave us coupons worth $300 Canadian. That barely makes up the difference between the original ticket and the Jet Blue ticket. Their comment was ""schedules cannot be guaranteed and they do not form part of the contract of travel."" That's ridiculous. ",29th March 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Barbados via Toronto,Feb-18,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,63
622,great attention from the Cabin Crew,Mandart Chan,TripVerified," As usual, on time service for my flight. I much rather going with Air Canada's professional and business service rather than the ""let's be friends"" attitude that you get with WestJet. Seats were older, but comfortable. Had great attention from the Cabin Crew throughout the whole flight.

623,Why pay for terrible service,B Edwards,TripVerified," Flew Vancouver to Edmonton. I have been consistently flying Westjet because I got fed up with Air Canada. This time I had to fly with them and once again I was greeted at the gate by a rude flight attendant. Air Canada continues to disappoint time after time to the point where I avoid them at all costs.

624,very bad customer oriented,K Norton,TripVerified," I am furious with Air Canada and advise everybody, especially women, to take another airline. My daughter is a girl, 18 years old, and had a ticket from Costa Rica to Amsterdam. The flight was overbooked. Air Canada took 3 woman of the flight that were traveling alone. The only message she got was that she should fly the next day. For her that was a huge problem. She only got a hotel voucher and was on her own there. Ground-service personnel hardly spoke English. I think this is irresponsible and very bad customer oriented. Never fly Air Canada.",26th March 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Costa Rica to Amsterdam via Toronto,Mar-18,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,63
625,flight has been delayed,Bren McDonell,TripVerified,"  Fort Myers to Toronto. At 4:25 I got a text saying “delay until 9:15”. I wasn’t surprised as the past 4 times this flight has been delayed, this is because the plane generally comes from LAX and always gets ground delays from there causing this flight to be delayed. The flight was subsequently delayed to 10:05PM, the check in attendant was very nice and even though my Mom had an overweight bag, he let us go free of charge because of the flight delay. At the gate, the boarding was very disorganized and passengers boarded in all wrong zones. The plane’s Auxillary Power Unit  was not working and therefore it was very hot. Our flight did not leave until 10:30 due to passengers taking too long to board. Flight  was fine, except the IFE was very slow. We landed in Toronto and waited another 30 minutes for our bags to come. Do not fly the late Fort Myers Flight as it can be delayed and make your night a wreck. Opt to fly WestJet or take the earlier flights.",26th March 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to Toronto,Mar-18,2,5,2,1,2,0,2,63
626,hopefully it will be my last flight,A Martin,TripVerified, To be honest this is not my first flight with Air canada but hopefully it will be my last flight. On 2 out of three flights my baggage was purposely missed and delivered after two days. On one out of three flights the flight was cancelled and one out of three the flight was delayed more than hour. They charge for luggage and they even charge for seat and food during the flight. The newest scam is donations (how can we trust them?). ,23rd March 2018,Business,Economy Class,Cancun to Ottawa,Mar-18,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,63
627,misplaced my luggage,Raheel Ahmad,TripVerified,"  Ottawa to Toronto. I started my journey from Ottawa and was supposed to switch to an international airline from Toronto. Air Canada misplaced my luggage and gave me a wrong boarding pass. I was lucky enough to figure out that the boarding pass was wrong and got the right one in time. But they lost my baggage and have still not been able to locate it deferring responsibility to other airline. I asked the person at the check in station three time, if there will be any issues regarding getting my baggage to the second airline company and she assured me that I will get my baggage at the final destination and will not be able to access it at Toronto airport. Grossly incompetent and the worst experience with the airline I have had.",22nd March 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to Toronto,Mar-18,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,63
628,Staff did a very good job,Bren McDonell,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Fort Myers. I would say this was a better flight than some other experiences I had with Air Canada. This flight was convenient, had an updated selection of movies on its IFE, Staff did a very good job, and the plane was on time! There was a scenario at the gate with a passenger getting REALLY upset over their bag having to be checked, and the Air Canada staff dealt with it correctly.",20th March 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Fort Myers,Mar-18,4,5,4,5,4,0,4,63
629,friendly and efficient,G Davidson,TripVerified, Great Christmas holiday in Spain starting with a visit to Air Canada’s new Signature Suite. Very personal attentive service and the food was great. The flights to and from Madrid were good. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. The A330 has the classic business class pods. The seat was uncomfortable even in bed mode and lacked storage places for personal electronics. The overall experience with Air Canada was good and I would fly with them again.,15th March 2018,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Toronto to Madrid,Dec-17,3,4,4,3,5,0,4,63
630,I found the service terrible,C Martin,TripVerified," We were delayed coming out of Vancouver on Feb 23 due to a snowstorm. We sat in the plane on the tarmac for 3 hrs waiting to de-ice, so a total of 8 hrs on this plane on this flight. I do not have any issues with the delay, this is weather related and out of anyone's control. However we had one drink the whole time we were on this flight and they ran out of food. So basically 8 hrs on a plane with one drink and no food. The service starts at the beginning of the plane and works it's way to the back which takes a long time for those sitting at back of plane. As well I had to ask for my drink 3 times after I paid for it, and each time they asked me what I had ordered. Once we connected to the ramp in Toronto it was another 50 minutes to de-board the plane and another 35 minutes to get luggage, as 4 flights were all on one baggage carriage to come through. Overall I found the service terrible, the snack I was able to get also was terrible and did not find a friendly experience overall with any of the staff. My coworker who also was on the plane rang for service several times no one ever came. I have travelled with Air Canada several times and for one reason or another there always seems to be an issue. I decided to write a review this time as I am definitely going to consider other airlines first before I have no choice but to fly with Air Canada. I think this airline needs to remember that ""ecomony"" calls is what supports the majority of the clients that fly with them and need to ensure those passengers are looked after as well as others.",14th March 2018,Business,Economy Class,Vancouver to Toronto,Feb-18,3,1,1,3,3,2,3,64

After 3 delays, 2 sleepless nights spent in the airports, can't blame the weather but it gets frustrating.

632,we bid for an online upgrade,Mike Palmer,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver in Premium Economy. In deciding which airline to take, we put weight on using AC on a direct flight with my partner having 50k Elite. The flaw in this was assuming 50k elite meant something and that a direct flight with one stop was fool proof. After booking the flight, we found we could only select seats available for both legs. So with no twins in a 2-4-2 formation available for both legs, we were forced to select an aisle and middle seat. (though different twins were available on either leg). Call centre and ground staff were unable to allocate different twins available for each leg as it's one flight / boarding card. We bid online for a cash upgrade and initially had money taken from our credit card only to have it returned to our account within hours. A request at the gate in Toronto for a seat change on either leg was answered with ""ask in Vancouver"". An on time departure but a poor meal service. Neither my partner or I got our choice of meal. A very average stew of veal was provided followed by drinks. On spotting an IPA ale on the cart appearing from club, I was told the IPA was a premium beer and not available in PPremium Economy. The service just feels ill thought out with a meal before a drink! At Vancouver, we were told we couldn't swap seats as we should have asked in Toronto! My partner was initially upgraded for free to biz as Premium Economy and Economy were over-sold which was then withdrawn when a connecting flight ran late and all classes suddenly available. Another average ""slop meal"" followed by drinks followed served by a very capable and very senior crew. After this alleged enhanced meal, service morphed into Economy with standard mid flight sandwich and an inedible breakfast. A late arrival was followed by late bags. The day before our return we were informed of a four hour delay. On arriving at the airport we checked in fine, and my partner invited to the Air NZ lounge as a star alliance gold member. (no invite for me as it's it's another airline's lounge) Despite the 4 hour delay the base manager wouldn't budge and bizarrely - no vouchers for food were issued despite an 4 hour+ delay. On boarding, we found out the original crew ran out of hours in Vancouver and it operated 12 hours late to Sydney with a spare crew who needed minimum rest. In terms of upgrades (again), we bid the max for an online upgrade and still didn't' get it. An ok meal served with drinks again served after. On arrival in Vancouver 5 hours late, we found the second leg had left on time with another aircraft and we had been bumped to other flights. (no announcements before arrival into Vancouver) At the gate, we were given PE seats and split up BUT on the original aircraft (with a new flight number in view of our original twin seats) Others from Sydney were in the same position a lot of angry customers feeling let down. Another average meal and drinks rounded off my most average Premium Economy experience ever. On the plus side, all crews were great with plenty of drinks runs. The fundamental design and architecture of this route is flawed. The inflexibility is annoying though when it suits AC, they will split the flight in two to maintain punctuality. Checking back, it is clearly most unreliable AC flight in their entire operation Upgrades were also harder on credits as it's treated as one flight. I would never do an ultra long flight with AC again where so much of the experience is fragile, mis-conceived, late and inflexible.",9th March 2018,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver,Feb-18,2,4,2,2,2,0,2,64

After boarding the plane and sitting on the plane for one hour we needed to deplane as there was a mechanical issue. No problem. I asked one of the Air Canada personnel what was the plan. She said they were trying to get another plane. No problem. Then I heard the plane was cancelled so I approached the desk again and this time I spoke with a young man who was fantastic. I explained to him I know everyone has their reason for wanting to get to their destination, I just wanted to know if he could assist me.

639,Customer service is certainly not a priority,S Jackson,TripVerified," We travel quite frequently and I can honestly say that traveling Air Canada has been the worst experience we have ever encountered. We left from Columbus, Ohio to Paris with a transfer in Toronto. When we got to the airport with the 3 hours that is recommended for foreign travel, no one was at the Air Canada counter. When they finally did arrive we were told that our flight to Toronto was delayed and as a result, we would not be able to go to Paris until the next day. Rather than assist us with alternative flight plans we were given a number to call, which proved to be futile. Our AAA representative was finally able to find a flight (American Airlines) for us so that we were able to get to Paris on the day we were scheduled. On our way home from Paris we encountered a 2 hour delay, with no explanation as to the reason. We got to Toronto with little time to spare for our connection to Columbus. Our luggage was not on the flight, and when we contacted the airlines the following day as to the whereabouts of our luggage we were told that ""the system was down"". Our luggage eventually did arrive, but this experience has taught us that we will never fly this airline again. Customer service is certainly not a priority with this airline",28th February 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Paris to Columbus, Ohio",Feb-18,1,2,3,3,1,2,1,64

641,vegan meal wasn't vegan,D Barnes,TripVerified, London to Toronto. Didn't provide food type selected. Vegan meal wasn't vegan.

642,absent for a big part of the flight,Patricio Morales,TripVerified," Some good flights, but a so-so flight too. Our experience was really confusing. Our first flight (Santiago Chile - Toronto) wasn't the best. In Santiago they haven't got many staff working. They opened the check in really late, with a long line waiting. The flight was fine, the food was ok, the service in flight was ok too. The flight Toronto-Tokyo was the best one. The staff at the airport were really polite and they solve all our problems. The staff on the plane were really good and they talked a lot with the passengers! They give us two meals and a lot of drinks. Our flight Tokyo-Toronto was ok too. But our flight Toronto-Santiago wasn't the best. The staff were not really that attentive. My partner is vegetarian, the first meal was quinoa and the salad was quinoa! Really bad, we asked for a solution, and they just said ""return it"".

644,Boeing 787-9 is poorly configured,J Deepah,TripVerified,  Toronto to London. The Boeing 787-9 is poorly configured and seat layout is not passenger friendly. Only consideration given is how to squeeze as many people in the plane. Aisles are narrow and passenger get disturbed by traffic. Air quality is better but seats are not comfortable.

645,the overall flight was enjoyable,Octave Caporossi,TripVerified," Second flight on Air Canada from Montreal to Geneva, and again I wasn't deceived. The crew were really sympathetic and spoke French, German and English. The legroom was standard for economy class and the selection of movies on the IFE was more than enough for a 6 hour and 49 minutes flight. But there were a few downsides, not necessarily the fault of the airline that need to be noted. We arrived 35 minutes late at Cointrin and we left the aircraft in rainshowers, but the true downside was a disruptive passenger. Before landing, the crew asked everyone to retract their seat, including in English, but the passenger didn't do it. The crew passed a last time for a verification and asked him to retract it, but when the crew were out of view he retracted it on me again just before landing. This type of dangerous passenger cannot be tolerated. But again the overall flight was enjoyable.",20th February 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Geneva ,Feb-18,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,65
646,an unpleasant attitude,W Neale,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Montreal. I was sitting in a window seat 19F and my entertainment system was not functioning. The flight attendant said there was a vacant window seat directly in front of me 18F but since it was an emergency exit she would come back and brief me on the instructions. I moved to the seat in question, got settled in again, ear phones in, blanket etc and 20 minutes into the show I was watching the same flight attendant said I couldn’t sit in that seat because it was a preferred seat and told me I must move to another seat! I said that I did not want to move again & reminded her that she told me to take that seat. She said she made a mistake and with an unpleasant attitude rudely insisted that I move. Needless to say if the equipment was in working order I never would have moved in the first place. In order to avoid the situation escalating I did move again to the back of the plane. When the food for purchase cart finally reached me in the backn of the plane almost everything was sold out so I was also unable to purchase the fruit/cheese platter that I wanted.",16th February 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Montreal,Feb-18,3,1,1,3,3,0,3,65
647,no one has taken any action,Paul Dunn,TripVerified,"  Hong Kong to Columbus via Toronto. We reached Toronto and flight to Columbus was cancelled due to snowstorm. That is when it took them over 4 hours to get us to a hotel. In that time the agents acted as if they had never handled a similar situation. There was no one in charge, or not, who could tell us anything for over 2 1/2 of those hours. I was assigned next day to the very next CMH flight. I asked about my luggage and was assured it would be on that flight. It was not. I filed a claim at CMH, and later was told it was lost, so I filed another 3 days later. The flight to Toronto was on the 12th of January, and it is now February 11th. I have called the lost baggage line multiple times over this period, and no one has taken any action that led to finding my luggage. It was obvious that there was no plan on their part to try to find it, as no one at any time has been able to tell me where it is. One agent tried to track and said he thought it was put on a flight to Pittsburgh on the 13th of January, stayed there 5 days, and was sent by protocol then to Montreal. I asked them how to contact Montreal baggage center and he said that even agents can not call them in Montreal, they can only email them. He stated that he would, nothing happened. I begged another agent a few days later to do something to locate the luggage. He seemed genuine in his concern, and said he would do a thorough investigation and get back to me in 2 hours. He did not contact me again. I had many souvenirs from Hong Kong and gifts from friends as I got engaged on the visit. I feel their system is set up to only deal with the ordinary travel situations. They have given no priority at Air Canada at all to helping passengers in a situation in which they send their luggage to the wrong place. The agents on scene in Toronto, and the leased agents they had in Columbus were at times disrespectful to us. The agents who knew what they were doing or were kind operate in an airline that shows no respect in these situations, and has not once reached out to me to help in correcting the situation. The only contact has been initiated by me. I believe their policy is ""let them complain, eventually they will go away!"" In this instance they are wrong. I will seek out every way I can to give them reviews like this one until someone listens to me.

650,the aircraft was filthy,T Eldem,TripVerified," Montreal to St. John’s on Air Canada. Check-in was quick and painless. Flight boarded by zone number and completed promptly. On board the aircraft was filthy with crumbs, almonds and wrappers strewn across the floor. My seat had an empty water bottle left behind confirming the poor or non-existent grooming of the aircraft before flight. The seat was comfortable but the tray table was very flimsy and hard to balance anything on it. We were served a hot breakfast and offered several rounds of drinks on this 2.5 hour flight. The IFE had a good range of films but I opted to watch my own on my mobile device. The washroom was a carbon copy of the main cabin in terms of cleanliness and grooming.

651,the worst airline I’ve ever flown,Bryce Livingston,TripVerified," Do not use this airline! Original flight out of Calgary was cancelled. I was not permitted to speak directly to an attendant. Instead I was given a customer service number. After 30 minutes on hold, I finally got my flight re-scheduled for the following day. I had to cover my own lodging. The following day, I sought to get on standby for an earlier flight which I received a ticket for. While boarding, I was told my bag was too large and they made me check it. The moderately rude attendant told me that I could change the baggage claim if I got on an earlier flight out of Toronto. When I got to Toronto, I asked to get on standby for the 16.55 flight to Syracuse. After waiting at the unoccupied customer service counter for over 30 minutes, the attendant there said I couldn’t because I had a checked bag. That flight was already delayed to 18.30 for mechanical issues. My original flight of 20.10 then also got “mechanical issues” and was delayed to 21.45. The carelessness of Air Canada employees is upsetting and the airline’s ability to problem solve is severely lacking. The entertainment amenities on the planes is worse than most other airlines. They nickle and dime customers be charging for small packets of pretzels. Finally, if someone gets a cancelled flight while trying to fly into the US, he/she cannot request a different route or city hub to fly though unless he/she is willing to pay for another connecting flight. Air Canada is the worst airline I’ve ever flown with and I hope I never fly with them again.",6th February 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Syracuse via Toronto,Feb-18,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,66

Then we were told they needed to refuel so another hour went by. After fuel and de-icing we were told there was a staffing issue and some workers could not continue do to length of shift.

654,The legroom was decent,Murat Polat,TripVerified,"  Flew from Montreal to Frankfurt. Plane was a 777 with the new livery. Boarding was completed without any problems. The legroom was decent and the personal IFE had plenty of new titles and a wide variety of songs. I wish AC offered Inflight WiFi like LH or TK. The dinner was okay, however, they were out of chicken when they came to my row so I didn't have any choice. The 'breakfast' they serve was just a slice of banana bread which wasn't good. The flight attendants were really sincere and did their job well. We departed Montreal with an hour delay and I had a connection flight with just an hour of layover, so one of the flight attendants informed me that they are aware of the situation and that they would relocate me to a front row business class seat before landing. I made it to my connection flight thanks to them.",30th January 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Frankfurt,Dec-17,4,5,4,5,5,0,5,66
655,food absolutely terrible,N Read,TripVerified," Sydney to Vancouver. Departure delayed at both ends of trip without notification, explanation or apology. Makeshift check out counters with luggage scales that didn’t work. Limited range of inflight entertainment and useless headphones. To top it all off, the food was absolutely terrible! Cashing in on a popular holiday route with expensive tickets and woeful service! Never again.",22nd January 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Vancouver,Jan-18,3,2,1,2,2,1,1,66
656,cabin crew were on point,W Kanodski,TripVerified," Flew Los Angeles to Vancouver. Great Experience. Once you get past the chaos of the boarding area at LAX the trip was really good. Flight was on time and cabin crew were on point. Good meal service and the flight attendants worked the cabin the entire time. Seats were older but still comfortable for a ""short"" flight. AC does a better job on this route than AA does as AA uses the E175 on the route with little service. When flying this route, or anywhere in Canada I will be using Air Canada. Lounge at YVR was ok, not the best, but not the worst. Seat back AV needs some updating as the screens are small, but the choices were good.",20th January 2018,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Vancouver,Jan-18,4,5,5,4,4,0,4,66
657,"clueless, uncaring, and unhelpful",A Irving,TripVerified," Our flight was cancelled last minute at the gate and were told to go to the customer service desk. However, upon arriving there, we were told to just go retrieve our luggage because the agents would not be able to help us and that we would have to call their customer service line to reschedule our flight. We were then given a card with a phone number to call to book another flight and to also book a hotel at a discount. However, upon calling the phone agent, we were told that because the cancellation was not their fault, they could not provide accommodation, even at a discount. We were also told that there would not be another direct flight out until 2 days later, although upon checking the internet, we saw that there were many other direct flights for the next day, with other airlines. The phone agent then told us that that they could not book us a flight with another airline, and that we would have to go back to the airport and speak to the desk agent. All the agents gave us different information and seemed clueless, uncaring, and unhelpful! Because of this airline's stupidity, we all lost out on a day's pay and had to drive down from Toronto to Newark so that we wouldn't miss out on another day's pay. Upon arriving back home, we found out that a friend also went through a similar experience previously with this airline.

658,easily the worst airline,Gary Merriam,TripVerified," Flew Los Angeles to Toronto. Air Canada is easily the worst airline in the western world. How can one airline loose so many bags, be so late for so many departures and arrivals, offer the most disgusting on board food and employ the nastiest most incompetent staff and still be in business is a mystery to me. Air Canada's hatred of its customers is evident at every level of the company and can be seen in every single employee you come in contact with. Air Canada is a national disgrace and embarrassment of Canada and should be avoided at all costs. Take a plane, a boat, a train.

659,delay made everyone exhausted,G Wang,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Beijing with a 7-hour delay. The entire trip is only about 10 hours from Vancouver to Beijing China, and the long delay made everyone exhausted. As a gesture of goodwill, this airline offers everybody a 15% off promo code, however, it is only good for a month - few people would fly again within such a short timeframe. On my return trip the flight was again delayed 2+ hours, leading me to miss the connection flight I'd already booked. So I was put on the next flight leaving YVR at 5 pm to Seattle. I did not feel too bad until I learned that the new connection flight was delayed for another 1+ hour. Delay after delay, making the travel very exhausting. I will probably never fly Air Canada again.",16th January 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Beijing,Jan-18,1,3,3,4,1,3,1,66
660,Overall a good flight,Brennan McDonell,TripVerified,"  Fort Myers to Toronto. Overall a good flight. The flight was delayed one hour due to weather in Toronto, and therefore the staff gave out free earphones on the airplane. They also gave free play kits to the children. The staff overall were just lovely. We landed in Toronto and we couldn’t park at a gate due to staff shortages, but the captain was very generous in keeping us updated.

662,crew were purposely avoiding people,L Belinski,TripVerified," Horrible customer service. We were delayed boarding by over 30 min. Once on the plane we left an hour and a half late. It seemed like the on board crew were purposely avoiding people and blamed the airport. We missed our connecting flight to Las Vegas along with 16 other people on our flight and got no apology from Air Canada, aparently putting us up a night in Vancouver more than makes up for a night in Vegas. I usually fly with another airline and only booked with Air Canada because it was part of the hotel package. I will happily pay more for a flight from a different airline since I felt like this happens very often and they didn't even make an attempt to try and get us there the same day.",14th January 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kelowna to Vancouver,Jan-18,4,1,1,3,1,1,1,67

My first flight was 2 hours delayed and I missed my connection flight from Montreal to Munich! The plane had not yet taken off when arriving in Montreal, but due to bad communication and very slow customer service I saw my flight leaving. Luckily the agent booked me on a flight going to Munich via Geneva, this flight was already 3 hours delayed. They delayed that flight another 1.5 hours when arriving at the boarding gate. We again left more than 2 hours late, which then made me miss my connection in Geneva. Delayed plans, bad customer service, no communication, food on the airplane was bad, we got very little water to drink during a 6 hours flight and the entertainment system was old and very slow.

664,delayed an hour as usual,D Smith,TripVerified, Toronto to Thunder Bay. Delayed an hour as usual and we were only informed 20 minutes before the flight.

665,no effort made whatsoever,Kyle Seagrove,TripVerified," So, Air Canada is officially the worst airline I've dealt with. And I've seen plenty. Side note - YYZ, YAM and even YTZ were open and functioning at the time. My flight was cancelled as I arrived to the airport, without any explanation, as another airline operating the same aircraft type, landed and took off safely. I was given an alternative to leave on Thursday instead of scheduled Monday flight, with no concern of how am I supposed to pay for my stay in Sault Ste Marie for additional 3 days, missing work at the same time. No food vouchers, hotel or any other accommodations were offered. No alternative flights were offered. Nor from another city, nor from different airline. Customer service is outsourced from India and is absolutely useless. That's unacceptable treatment of customers, with no effort made whatsoever to rectify the situation. I was left with no alternative but miss work, look for accommodation and pay for food for three days. Cancellation email was received after I've returned from the airport, and the monitors still showed the flight as delayed. Please note - the airport wasn't closed, as different airline flight, using the same aircraft type, arrived and left on time. Also, I wasn't offered any alternative and was told that I have to ""get to Sudbury myself if I want to fly from there"", as well as the claim that ""my expenses on the ground will not be reimbursed, because flight cancellation was caused by extreme weather"" (please see above RE: airports operable).

We fly a lot, and have never had such a bad experience, even with airlines that are much cheaper than Air Canada. It's not just that they treat you terribly but they genuinely do not care!

667,great deal and a great ride,Jonathan Chester,Not Verified,"London to Montreal. It's always a pleasure to get a great deal and a great ride. I booked this trip to UK for Xmas back in August for three people (12 adults and 1 teenager) including extra baggage and seat assignment for less than $1,000 cad each. I had very low expectations. One the return flight we had an older A330, which definitely looks old school now, but with better leg room and personal space than the Boeing 787. The seats feel abused and lacking cushion for sure. Having said that the crew were pleasant, easy going and efficient. They served drinks, then a meal service, then another drinks service, then a snack service and I can say for once I wasn't hungry or grossed out by what they offered. Even got a ""free"" 2nd bottle of cheap red wine. The flight was ahead of schedule landing and we even relaxed enough to socialize with our fellow passengers on board and make new friends. Kudos to Air Canada for a really great economy experience. I still prefer biz or premium economy!",11th January 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Montreal,Jan-18,3,1,4,3,5,0,5,67

Every passenger on the flight was treated in the same manner. Cancellation email was received after I've returned from the airport, and the monitors still showed the flight as delayed. AC replied to my claim, stating that they ""don't reimburse delays due to extreme weather"" and offered me 25% discount on the future flights.

I was left stranded for three days, with no explanation and means of accommodation. Not even mentioning I was already avoiding Air Canada, now I will do everything possible not to fly with them again. Unfortunately, they hold monopoly on flights within the country for the most part.

669,"everything was neat, tidy and clean",H Ding,TripVerified," A great flight from Air Canada, returning from Frankfurt to Calgary in premium economy. The majority of my recent flights have been on AC (also flown WestJet, EasyJet, and Lufthansa, I've found that AC compares favourably). Getting on board on this flight, I let my clean-obsession take over. If there was something out of place or noticeably dirty on or around my seat, I'd notice. But everything was neat, tidy and clean. The flight was on time. The cabin crew on AC is usually friendly, but this time I was struck by just how pleasant they were: My request for an extra meal (it was a 21-hour-long travel day for me) was immediately accommodated. The attendant came around in good time and offered more wine to the cabin without people even asking. When I missed the second meal (breakfast wraps) because I was asleep, the attendant brought me two servings to make up for it. When I asked for coffee, the attendant brought a handful of something, saying: 'I didn't know if you wanted sugar-and-cream or Baileys, so I brought both - choose wisely! I chose wisely and went with Baileys - and I'll choose Air Canada again because believe it or not, this kind of service and friendliness is pretty typical on most flights, and I've flown with them on countless times. There have been delays, but nothing not related to weather or maintenance; and most delays were compensated by vouchers or flight discounts. In general they're actually a pretty consistent airline.",8th January 2018,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Calgary ,Dec-17,5,5,5,5,4,0,5,67
670,exceptional at apologizing,J Solmon,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to San Jose. There is nothing terrible about the flight itself, it’s relative brevity / directness (2hrs), the staff, or other normalcies you’d expect from a flight. I have taken this flight both ways approx every 3 weeks for the last 9 months and I get to the destination between 30-60mins late on average (enough so that I plan for it in my calendar and always arrive the airport 10mins prior to boarding as I know there will be extra waiting). Today it’s some kind of maintenance issue (we’ll likely be delayed 3-4hrs before takeoff is the estimate over the loudspeaker).  It’s routine for Air Canada to be delayed on this particular flight. It seems Air Canada is exceptional at apologizing for things though - I’ve heard more of the phrase “I’m sorry” on this flight than anywhere else (and I’m Canadian, so very used to hearing it regardless of context). I’m not a complainer, and a frequent flier, so understand all the things that can go wrong and have sat through most of them. I’m not sitting here fuming or anything. I have a phone / laptop and can work. It’s just something about the inconsistency of this particular flight that I’m hoping to prepare people for.

671,Terrible ground service,P Keane,TripVerified,"  Copenhagen to Toronto intending to connect to a final destination in Florida. The flight was fine, our problems started the second we touched down in Canada. During the flight, we were asked if our final destination was the US or Canada and given the appropriate customs form. However, on getting there, we discover that we still have to go through Canadian customs and so needed the Canadian form too. We then had to get to a waiting area for our bags to come off the Air Canada flight and go through to US customs. On the airplane and by several signs in the terminal not to pick up our bag for customs; it would go directly through. My bag took 2 hours to get to where it needed to go and my companion’s bag was lost. So, naturally, at this point we can’t get to our next flight because US customs requires your checked bag to be accounted for first. So, we missed our next flight. It’s a busy time of year so no other flights were available for two days. We go to the counter to get a hotel since it’s their fault we couldn’t continue on our trip. We’re told by one employee to go talk to another, who gives us the phone number of their help line. I spend half an hour on hold waiting to talk to them only to be told they can’t do hotel vouchers over the phone and I have to talk to someone in the terminal. We finally get our hotel, but they’ll only book it for one night because their policy is we have to try again tomorrow to get rebooked on an earlier flight. So, today, now the day after our original flight, I spend another half hour on hold trying to save them money by getting an earlier flight and not having to spend another night in a hotel only to be told that because another airline operates our final flight, they can’t do anything. So my travel companion goes to the Air Canada counter to get us approved for another night at the hotel. When she finally talks to someone, they tell her she needs to speak to the person at the ticketing counter to be told again that there are no earlier flights to Florida before they’ll approve a second hotel night. So now she’s waiting in line to talk to a ticketing agent and they only have two clerks at the desk and a line of over forty people when there are a lot of passengers displaced during this time of year all trying to get home.

673,Our flight got delayed,Marina Chekonova,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Vancouver. First of all, our flight from Vancouver on Dec 23, 2017 was cancelled and we were never notified by Air Canada. We came to the airport and found that we need to take another flight, which was delayed and we couldn’t make connection from Toronto to Quebec on time. We had to spend 1,5 hours to find another ticket and it was just the beginning of nightmare. Our flight was Premium Economy, and the ticket was changed to economy without any refund or explanation whatsoever. I had a fracture in my spine and metal rod was installed, that was the reason for Premium class and a window seat, so that I wouldn’t suffer from pain. Instead we were seated by the toilet in economy and I had severe pain through the flight and a day after. When we finally got to Toronto our flight to Quebec got delayed and we had to wait another 2,5 hours. We got there eventually, but on the way back it was the same story. Our flight got delayed, we did not make it to our connection flight and on Dec 30, 2017 we got stuck in Montreal. Air Canada provided accommodation after an argument, but we had to take an extra flight to make it home on December 31, 2017. Thank you Air Canada for screwing up New Years for us. The seats that we booked originally were cancelled and they couldn’t find a place to accomodate a person with severe back pain.

676,never fly this airline again,R Leane,TripVerified,"  I took this flight from Vancouver to San Diego with my husband and son on Dec 28th. The flight was scheduled from 8pm - 11pm. 7:30 PM - Upon arrival at the departure gate we were informed the plane was delayed for an unspecified period of time. 8:40 PM - We boarded 40 mins late. My family all had only carry on bags, which we quickly realized would not fit in the overhead compartments - along with a many other passengers. Our bags were taken from us to be placed under the plane, and would have to retrieved via the carousel in San Diego. It seemed odd that all the flight staff watched us board with bags they knew would not fit in the plane? The overhead compartments were broken and duct taped in several places on the plane. One gentlemen even remarked that he thought the front window of the plane was duct taped. 9:20 - Takeoff The plane seemed very old and in dire cosmetic disrepair. The flight staff were friendly. They mentioned that another crew was scheduled to work the flight we were on but were delayed so they were working on a 12 hour day. No snacks were offered, only water, coffee and juice. Staff was pleasant, in cabin entertainment was working. 11:40 - We approached San Diego to learn we had to divert to LAX due to fog. Everyone was obviously disappointed and also confused because it didn't appear foggy. Once in LA we sat in a deserted area of the airport hoping to be accepted for deplaning. Several announcements were made to try and appease our frustrations but the pilot himself seemed utterly defeated. He mentioned that he ""we shouldn't worry, because they were already assured we wouldn't have to return to Vancouver."" We were just sitting there on the tarmac waiting for something to happen. At one point there was supposed to be a bus coming to get us and staff to help accommodate our various scenarios. 1:30 AM - We were able to utilize a deplaning corridor (our plane was too small to fit against the tunnel opening, so we walked down the stairs of the plane and up into the terminal via a second set. Not a big deal but just fed the flames of frustration people were feeling.) We were encouraged that an Air Canada staffer would meet us at the luggage carousel to advise us of our compensation / options. We were also told the reason the plane didn't land in San Diego was because the in flight crew had worked 12 hours and wanted out of the air and didn't want to circle to wait to land. We checked the flight status at San Diego airport and it appeared all other flights were landing. 2:00 AM - Air Canada staffers advised those of us wishing to leave to submit car rental vouchers to Air Canada, those in need of boarding stayed back. I will try this but some other folks with previous experiences of this nature didn't seem hopeful that we would be reimbursed. I will remain hopeful. We rented a car for $100 from Avis. 4:00 AM - We arrived at Hotel in San Diego. My parents were to arrive in San Diego today to meet us on the same Air Canada flight 8 pm - 11pm. After our experience yesterday, I was very worried for them. Rightfully so, the flight was cancelled right at 8:00 PM ""no pilot"".

Because of this delay, we couldn't get our connection flight from Toronto to Frankfurt.

Noted soft drink or pop as is referred to being poured from cans into plastic cups. Why not provide cans to customers? Air Canada flight attendants very robotic and impersonal.

Try to call, Wait on hold for 2 hours to get told, They say they need more time to find them. They offered us $100 each.  We got 1 set of clothes each to wear to our family Christmas parties and a few toiletries. They were blaming it on the weather but it was clearly due to there lack of organization. Got to Toronto and sat on the runway for 30 mins waiting for ground crew. When we got on our next plane to go to Montreal it was delayed so we could get on it.

The next day after our expensive unexpected stay in Montreal we finally boarded our plane to Bagotville. We now have been sitting in the small plane for over an hour after our scheduled take off time due to mechanical issues. I do not recommend Air Canada to anyone trying to keep a schedule what so ever. ",25th December 2017,Couple Leisure,First Class,Victoria to Bagotville,Dec-17,3,2,1,1,2,1,2,69
683,cheap and nasty headsets,B Brown,TripVerified," Hong Kong to Vancouver. Our family decided to try out the premium economy service given that it was such a long flight plus the rather lacklustre reviews I have read about Air Canada's economy class comfort and service. As it transpired, it probably wasn't worth the additional expense. The seating was a plus (extra legroom plus a little extra width of seats) and this made the difference b/w no sleep and a little sleep. The first meal - a beef casserole - was very good, and served with metal cutlery etc. The next meal, in contrast, was very ordinary and served with plastic cutlery and I'm very forgiving about airline food generally. The biggest disappointment was the cheap and nasty headsets which meant that it was too unpleasant to watch any movies - the sound quality was that poor. These were flimsy single jack throwaway units used in a conjunction with a double jack fitting in the seat arm (and a loose fit at that). I didn't speak about this with other passengers but noticed that surprisingly few people had their screens turned on during the flight. Note too that I tried several different headsets on several different seats, and they all either failed to work at all or had the same poor sound quality. I've since raised this with Air Canada but their response suggested that this was a one-off equipment failure - it wasn't, those headphones could never provide acceptable sound quality. Appears to be more a case of penny-pinching by management. If they can't afford better then the very least they could do would be to recommend that passengers bring their own headsets.",24th December 2017,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Hong Kong to Vancouver,Dec-17,4,3,3,1,2,0,2,69
684,my luggage didn’t make it,J Dietze,TripVerified," Flew from Adelaide, Australia to Calgary, Canada. No problems with baggage making it on time with me for my first 3 flights. My first Air Canada flight was delayed because of weather, so there would have been plenty of time to load the luggage on while we waited. When I arrived to Vancouver, I had to go quickly to my connecting flight, and so my luggage didn’t make it. When I arrived to Calgary, I was informed the missing luggage would be on the first flight the next day and then would be flown to Lethbridge and driven by courier to my home. Checking the tracking website over the past two days, only one of the bags arrived in Calgary. (They look exactly the same and have the exact same luggage tag and were on the same flight to Vancouver.) The other is yet to be found and the status has not changed in 48 hours. Customer service on the phone continues to ask me to allow more time and not do much to hurry things up. Not impressed.",24th December 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Calgary via Vancouver,Dec-17,3,2,0,0,2,0,1,69
685,appalling customer service,S Karson,TripVerified," On the 19th December I was meant to catch an AC8670 8pm flight from Vancouver to San Diego, my first time flying Air Canada. 20 mins before boarding time, we were told the flight was cancelled because the plane needed to be de-iced and would not make San Diego's 12am curfew. Fine. Then, we were told we had to go out through customs and immigration and go re-book tickets with Air Canada. The lady at the Air Canada desk was extremely rude saying that they weren't re-booking tickets there even though we'd be directed to go there - she provided essentially no customer service. Another thing - some passengers are automatically re-booked onto flights and others aren't which is super inconsistent and something I expect a budget airline to do - I wonder is Air Canada a budget airline or Canada's national carrier? Because it is a total embarrassment of a carrier. Moreover, even though I was re-booked onto a flight the next day at 8pm, I was not given any accommodation vouchers or food vouchers or anything. I received nothing in compensation. I understand the flight was cancelled due to safety reasons, but Air Canada has appalling customer service and I will never fly them again.",24th December 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to San Diego,Dec-17,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,69
686,maybe should charge a train fare,G Edwards,TripVerified," I booked my flight with Swiss Air Lines. The leg of the trip from Toronto to Geneva is operated by Air Canada and at all times during booking and in all consequtive email confirmations was always positioned as direct. Only at Pearson I knew that my flight is ""domestic"" and it ""stops"" at Montreal though it is ""indeed direct"" flight to Geneva. I asked if we stay on the plane during the stop and we don't - we get off the plane and later board it again. If Air Canada started to turn planes into trains maybe it should charge a train fare. And not letting people know in advance what is that they are paying for in my opinion is a fraud.",23rd December 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Geneva,Dec-17,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,69
687,very polite and helpful,G Garanello,TripVerified,"  Philadelphia to Quebec via Montreal. Staff on each leg were very polite and helpful. Seats were average comfort. My issue was cancellation of flight from Philadelphia to Montreal. We got boarding passes in morning and just happened to see an email from AC stating flight next morning was cancelled and they couldn’t get us on another airline. We already had a ride set up and were meeting friends, Hotel was booked. They didn’t pick up the phone to notify us. I called and they said due to weather but they had a flight leaving from Newark. Didn’t make sense They only had one seat on Newark flight. They eventually got us on an American Airlines flight. If it was weather, how could flight from Newark land.

688,I’ll never fly them again,D Garmer,TripVerified,"  Thunder Bay to Windsor via Toronto. Worst service ever, the women behind the desk are miserable in Thunder Bay. I was greeted at 4am with attitude. A rude tone and someone who doesn’t want to be there. Also when I asked why the rates went up suddenly for a bag over the 50lbs. Her response was “I just don’t have a answer for you ok”. Then I arrive in Toronto to find out my flight was cancelled and moved 5 hours later. Without notice and when I asked why the lady behind the desk responded with “weather”. I found it funny how a plane can fly from Toronto to London no problem, but to fly 15 min farther it can’t. It’s a lie. They lie to customers to fill cabins they cancel flights all the time. I can’t think of a time I used Air Canada and was happy. I’ll never fly them again.

",N Johnson,TripVerified," Flew Air Canada from Calgary to Toronto. Flight got delayed on the departure by 3 hours, and 1.5 hours on the retun.

Cabin cleanliness and cabin service were both up to snuff. Prompt drinks service and attendants that made frequent rounds. These smaller Bombardier crafts are only equipped with one bathroom and have smaller overhead bins, but having a tendency to pack light and efficiently, I had a hard time finding fault with the flight equipment.

691,The service was terrible,E Walber,TripVerified," London to Toronto Pearson. I decided to upgrade to Premium Economy for the extra benefits. I have always travelled Air Transat Club before and thought that this might be the same or better, as it was more expensive. The service was terrible. The flight attendants seem to be in First Class and Economy and the Premium Economy gets no one. We were offered water or juice when we boarded and there was no bar service after take-off. No flight attendants were seen after take-off and close to 2 hours later, the meal came. We were given a glass of wine and refills were not offered. An hour after the meal, we were finally offered a cocktail. This should have been done before the meal service. There was one other pass of the cocktail cart when they passed out a snack before landing. I paid $3,400 return for just a larger seat. No other perks were offered and the crew were not at all pleasant. I even complained to them afterwards and just got a note thanking me for my input. I will never fly Premium Econony again as it is truly a waste of money. I do not even think I will fly Air Canada again as there Customer Service is the worst.

692,Thanks for messing my day,Hussein Alawsi,TripVerified,"  St Johns to Houston via Toronto. My son had a game a game on Saturday December 09/2017. I have promised him that I will leave some work undone and change my flight from Sunday to Friday so that I can make it on his game on Saturday 8:00AM. I have made the change and paid the extra 524.70 $. My flight from St. John’s was delayed one hour. But was still going to make it. I have arrived to Toronto and run from the aircraft all the way to passport control which I have Global entry and that will boost the process faster. While at the passport control I still have 35 minuets and the walk to the gate is on 5 minutes. The passport control did not let me through due to my luggage was loaded off and she told me not to worry, I still have time. She said just go to the helpdesk for Air Canada which was 1 minute away. When I arrived there. I discovered that Air Canada decided to change my flight to next morning and they can’t put luggage on the plane and will not let me leave to Houston without my luggage. I have tried to explain a lot and couldn’t get them to put on that flight or any other flight that could help me to achieve my goal. And funny enough, they have told me that I was paged on my arrival gate to see if I’m going on this flight or not. This is so funny, how the heck I would know that I will be called on my arrival gate, on top of that they should’ve be expecting me running to my departure gate. They have booked me the worst hotel and have told me that I have to go to this hotel without my luggage. Normally for human being, the luggage will be needed at the hotel so that shower can be taken and changing. So they basically they don’t let me go to Houston without my luggage on the flight and would let me go to hotel without it. What make it so funny is that I’m writing this review while waiting on Saturday morning for my flight which have not arrived yet, it’s been 30 minuets already. Thanks Air Canada for messing my day and have me away from my son’s game. ",9th December 2017,Business,Economy Class,St Johns to Houston via Toronto,Dec-17,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,70
693,I was pleasantly surprised,Cory Loughlan,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Brisbane. Looking to move from Canada to Australia I was happy to see a direct flight to Brisbane from Air Canada. Value for a roundtrip fare was exceptional, we booked the base economy 'Tango' fare (Y) and we picked up the round trip flight on a seat sale which cost us just under $1,000 each. This included 2 checked bags each, which really helped us as we ended up checking one of our carryon bags as we didn't need it in the cabin with us. Once at the airport, boarding was quick and efficient by the staff on the ground. We boarded and were in the air about 12:20am, 5 minutes ahead of our scheduled takeoff. We were sat in row 31, seats J & K which were exit row seats, a pillow and blanket were provided at each seat. Once the seatbelt sign was turned off meal service and drinks started right away. Options for dinner were Chicken or Beef with vegetables and potatoes. I chose chicken which was average for airplane food (Picture attached). I then browsed the entertainment selection with a post dinner drink. The entertainment had 100's of different films and sitcom option, however none had appealed to me at the time and I was fairly tired so I ended up not watching anything. The best part of the flight was the seat comfort. After dinner I put some earplugs in and went to sleep. I ended up falling asleep for a good 6 hours at which time I woke up and tried the entertainment system again to no avail, at which point I fell back asleep for a few more hours. I did have an exit row which meant I did have extra legroom, however lots of people congregate there to use the washroom that is in the centre row. Even though I had the extra legroom I was not looking forward to the 15 our flight in the middle seat, however in the end I was pleasantly surprised. About 2 hours before landing the crew came around to serve breakfast. The choices were scrambled eggs with salsa or pancakes, I choose the eggs which were not great at all, I would have choose the sweeter option. (There was another service halfway thought the flight for a light snack, however I was asleep for that service). After breakfast the crew quickly cleaned up, I changed and freshened up in the washroom which was fairly standard and had ample space to change. This one was situated in the centre of the cabin however I was told the one up front in premium economy actually had a window in the washroom. A few minutes earlier than expected we had a smooth landing in Brisbane around 9:30 am, where I felt surprisingly fresh after the 15 flight and ready to take on the day.",5th December 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Brisbane,Nov-17,5,5,3,4,4,0,4,70

The plane looked new, was very clean, and crew made sure it stayed clean throughout out the flight. Inflight entertainment was great. Lots of movies and shows to pick from. 2 meals were served on the flight and were quite decent. Best airplane food I have had thus far.

695,staff on board all very nice,L James,TripVerified," Positifs : Vols à l'heure, sièges confortables (nous avions payé pour avoir des sièges avec plus d'espace pour les jambes), personnel à bord tous très gentils. Négatifs : Les repas en vols étaient plus que médiocres. On nous a servi un bol de nouilles déshydratées avec de l'eau bouillante, un petit sandwich au jambon et deux biscuits secs pour un des repas durant le vol Toronto-Hong Kong. Et au retour, c'était le même menu. Pour le souper, nous avons eu droit à un boeuf tellement gras que ce n'était pas mangeable et comme dessert, un brownies tellement sec que le manche de ma cuillère en plastique a cassé. Pour le vol Toronto-Québec (durée de vol 1 h 40), on ne nous a rien offert à manger. Drôlement différent d'avec Bangkok Airways ou Thai Airways qui nous ont servi des repas délicieux avec des ""vrais"" ustensiles, et ce, même si les vols ne duraient que 1 h 30. Quand on les compare, c'est assez désolant. - Positives: Flights on time, comfortable seats (we had paid to have seats with more legroom), staff on board all very nice. Negatives: The meals in flights were more than mediocre. We were served a bowl of dehydrated noodles with boiling water, a small ham sandwich and two biscuits for one meal during the Toronto-Hong Kong flight. And on the way back, it was the same menu. For dinner, we had a beef so fat that it was not edible and as a dessert, a brownie so dry that the handle of my plastic spoon broke. For the Toronto-Quebec flight (flight time 1:40), we were not offered anything to eat. Funnily different from Bangkok Airways or Thai Airways who served us delicious meals with ""real"" utensils, even if the flights lasted only 1:30. When we compare them, it's pretty sad.

696,pathetic ground handling,Savi Mull,TripVerified,  Toronto to Washington Dulles operated by Air Georgian. Absolutely pathetic ground handling and gate agents who had no clue about the status of the flights. Gates were changed and we flew to Dulles 4.5 hours delayed with no prior information either at the gate or screen board. All flights around us were being cancelled. Appalling lack of customer service at Air Canada's hub - Toronto Pearson. We landed at Dulles at 1.30am as the last flight into IAD.

698,forced to pay for selecting a seat,D Cain,TripVerified,  Booked Honolulu to Ottawa via Vancouver for December. My complaint is the manner in which Air Canada has increased the price of their fares by offering reduced seat fares through travel web sites (e.g. Expedia) only to underhandedly force the purchaser to pay for selecting a seat either before or during check-in and paying for every piece of luggage. This practice is deceiving and dishonest. I have come to appreciate airlines who are forthright in their pricing practices through travel web sites and have flown many that are completely above board. It is unfortunate that we are serviced by so few airlines in Canada that this type of price gouging is allowed to continue. I will take every opportunity to fly another airline including non-domestic airlines other than fly Air Canada or its discount equivalent Rouge.,23rd November 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Ottawa via Vancouver,Nov-17,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,70
699,we booked it with a third party,A Barden,TripVerified,"  The plane was super cramped and no food was offered unless you pay for it, including pretzels. Our return flight was a nightmare. We had to change our return date a day early (same flight route). The AC desk at the Portland airport has selective hours and no one there until 2 hours before the first flight out. So we had to wait 1.5 hours for staff to change the flight. The girl arrived and we were first in line (with a huge line up behind us). Staff said we booked it with a third party so we have to go through them to change anything. We asked if there was still room on the flights we were looking to retuning and she said yes. We asked if she could do anything for us, and if there is anything we can do to get on this flight. She said she can't help us and when we exhibited frustration from waiting over an hour and a half in line for a desk agent she said others are waiting too and you are holding them up! After an hour on the phone trying to change our flights, AC wanted $200 per ticket change fee and the price difference between flights which was over $1,400. No one was willing to do anything for us. This was the worst travel experience we've had with an airline.

700,50% of all flights are delayed,G Danson,TripVerified,"  I have been flying Air Canada Jazz from Portland to Vancouver BC and back for the last 6 years (almost every weekend - except when I fly Alaska instead). I have been trying to fly Alaska more often. My flight is delayed again. Out of all my flights with Air Canada, almost 50% of all flights are delayed. I am wondering why that is. When Alaska has only delayed 10% at most during my 6 years going the same route. I really want Air Canada management to take a hard look at why they cannot be on time more often on the same route that Alaska does. Weather is a problem for all airlines, but it cannot account for a 50% delay record. It is unacceptable for an airline to take passenger's money and not try their best to fulfill their end of the bargain.",21st November 2017,Business,Economy Class,Vancouver to Portland,Nov-17,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,71
701,very good experience,Kevan Peters,VerifiedReview,"  Vancouver - London Heathrow return. Nov 1-13, 2017. Overall, very good experience. Online check-in easy and quick with very easy printing of boarding passes and luggage tags at the airport kiosks. Ground staff professional. The zone boarding process can be confusing as, even though specific zones are called, passengers from other zones tend to get into line prior to being called. Ground staff don't seem to manage this boarding process well and this is not the first trip where I've encountered this issue. Planes were clean and well kept. Onboard staff were professional and efficient. Meals were tasty, which was a vast improvement over my last international trip with AC. Vancouver - London Heathrow included 1 hot meal and a very small breakfast - a slice of gingerbread and a small yogurt. This is not sufficient for a flight almost 10 hours long. London Heathrow - Vancouver included a hot meal, mid flight snack and then a hot fajita about 1.5 hours prior to landing. Frequent drink runs both flights. Overall, onboard service was efficient and well done, but not outstanding. Seats are reasonable but not overly comfortable. Onboard entertainment system worked very well both flights and there was a good variety of TV, movies and music. The only negative comment would be that AC charges for advance seat selection on Tango fares, fares are high enough without adding this extra fee. Will continue to fly Air Canada and recommend this airline.",15th November 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to London,Nov-17,3,3,3,4,4,0,4,71
702,space is extremely cramped,J Mackay,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Philadelphia to Toronto. I would like to begin by pointing out that at the Philadelphia International airport checking for this flight was done by United airlines personnel. Up to this point I have refrained from commenting about United based on the negative press however after experiencing the checking I have to agree with everything that is being reported. The United personnel at Philadelphia Airport were extremely rude. I am a crew member for a cruise line and normally I ask to have my bags tagged ""priority"", that way they arrive at the final destination, other airlines usually have no problem doing this however the United person at the counter said to me ""No"". At one point during the conversation I had to ask if she was having a good day and then that sort of made her realize how nasty she was being. As far as the flight I do have to say that we were up in the air for about an hour and there’s really not much to comment other than the fact that I paid for the preferred seating and there is not much difference between that and regular seat. The space is extremely cramped as you will see in the photo I have attached. The flight attendants however were very nice, the plane was clean and the flight went on without any incident. I would definitely recommend this airline but please be aware that the check-in could be done by United and that could ruin your first impression.",10th November 2017,Business,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Toronto,Jul-17,2,4,0,2,1,0,3,71
703,They still have room for improvement,J Mackay,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Toronto to Copenhagen. On this international flight and first time with Air Canada I have to mention that I am very impressed with the friendliness of the aircrew in general. The aircraft was beautiful and clean however I paid for extra legroom and I found myself next to an emergency door which I had no problem staying on however the seats did not have a movable armrest. I had a row of two for myself but I was not able to move the armrest because it was stationary. The seat also felt kind of narrow. I was served a hot meal, two snacks, plenty of drinks (alcohol beverages included) and a light breakfast. There was no Wi-Fi on this flight and the entertainment selection was mediocre with only a handful of movies and TV shows. I am a big fan of the Boeing 777 because it is spacious, relatively quiet and depending on the airline the amenities can be quite good. Overall I would definitely fly Air Canada again because they were friendly, I felt safe, and they got me to my destination on time. They still have room for improvement when it comes to the entertainment offerings, the comfort of the seat, and please do not have United personnel do your checking at the airport it ruins the first impression.",10th November 2017,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Copenhagen,Jul-17,2,4,4,2,1,0,3,71

I precleared US Customs in Toronto which meant that I could just walk straight out of the aircraft and hop into my car without further delay. The service was quite good and the food was also very enjoyable given that it was an actual hot meal. The IFE system had monitors in the seatbacks which made it easy and functional.

705,poorly trained check-in supervisors,S Patton,VerifiedReview,"  Brisbane to San Francisco via Vancouver. What an atrocious check-in experience traveling to the US. Stay away unless you're on a visa waiver, visa, permanent resident or US citizen. The check-in supervisors have zero idea how to deal with anything else and are a combination of poorly trained, arrogant, aggressive and power tripping. Two supervisors were involved and they were both the same. They don't know that other forms of US travel authority exist (a US Advance Parole combo card in this case). They had no idea how to type the Advance Parole combo card into their computer, so just wildly guessed, with one attempt before giving up. The computer then said I wasn't cleared to fly, because they'd typed in garbage data, which they insisted was what was going to happen ""because we don't have the authority to override the system"". Instead of just saying ""I'm not sure how to process this card, let me call someone who can help me"" their *first* opening approach is to say ""we have to offload you because you don't have a visa or permanent resident card and that's what our systems require"". No attempt to solve the problem and understand. Utter aggressive refusal to let me explain what an Advance Parole card is and that I am indeed allowed to fly to the US, you just have to call someone who knows what this card is. Literally I was trying to show them my phone and get them to read a paragraph from a US government website explaining what an Advance Parole combo card was and that it grants travel authority. They refused to read it - ""I don't care what that says because we have to do what the computer says and it says to offload you"". No matter that the computer only said that because they didn't know how to type this card in! Finally they call US immigration, after about 20 minutes of telling me they are going to offload me and aggression. They keep calling the combo card an ""Employment Authorization Document"". It has that in big print along the top, and the Advance Parole part in little print along the bottom. I keep trying to explain that it's a 2-in-1 combo card and to read the sentence on the bottom when talking to US immigration. ""We know what to say"". US Immigration answers, they refuse to read the bottom of the card, calling it an Employment Authorization Document and looking at me smugly. After many minutes on the phone the person on the other end finally asks them what is on the bottom of the card and they read it out with a grimace. About 30 minutes in after countless threats of offloading and one threat of calling airport police ""because we don't like you"" I am cleared to fly. They don't say a word to me, refuse to look at me. Just pass my passport to a check-in counter worker and say ""he's cleared to fly"". The in-flight experience was great, a near new Boeing 787. It was all destroyed by those power tripping poorly trained check-in supervisors who shouldn't be anywhere near a customer facing role.",8th November 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to San Francisco via Vancouver,Nov-17,4,4,3,3,1,0,3,71
706,abhorrent customer service,C Racheleau,VerifiedReview,"  Vancouver to Baltimore via Toronto, and my bag went missing. I transferred planes in Toronto. I left Vancouver Oct. 3rd. My bag never showed up in Baltimore. I immediately placed a baggage claim report with an Air Canada representative at the airport (which took over an hour as their were no representatives at the kiosk and no one picked up when I called repeatedly; I had to call the 1-800 customer service hotline to get them to contact a representative at the airport). I was told they'd send my bag through to my hotel where I was staying for work for a week. My bag never turned up; I called and emailed multiple times daily to no avail. I had to purchase all new work clothing, shoes, toiletries etc. It is now more than a month later and I have home in Vancouver. Since then I've travelled on several flights for work and have several more this year. I still do not have an answer from air Canada. It has been like pulling teeth trying to get ahold of anyone that could help. My baggage number is still under ""locating"" and I have filed claims for ""delayed"" baggage as you cannot file ""lost"" status until they tell you it cannot be found. I filled my ""delayed"" claims the day I arrived home to Vancouver Oct 10th. I have made numerous calls, Facebook posts, instagram posts, twitter posts, and emails to customer service, baggage claims, and whoever else I could find to contact. And I still have ZERO answers on where my bag is, if it will be found, if I will be reimbursed. Or if I will even be reimbursed for the $50 I paid to check the luggage (the money I paid to have someone lose my bag). I have been clear that I understand mistakes happen and it is not the loss of property that has me truly disgruntled (although this is a nightmare when on a business trip).

708,staff are incapable,Francois Van Wyk,VerifiedReview," I travel globally at least once a month. I have never experienced this bad service from any airline. Firstly I could not check on online. When I tried to check in at the airport, they did not understand that I am a European resident, with a valid blue card. Took 45 minutes to sort out. Never happened before in my tavels. I felt Air Canada staff were confused as I have a South African passport. Then worst yet, the boarding of the plane! Have never seen anything worse! The zones dont work, people are agressive. The staff are incapable. Really this airline is the worst ever. Avoid!",3rd November 2017,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Munich,Nov-17,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,71

Unless you are an American, European or Canadian do yourself a favor and do not fly Air Canada. They have staff who don’t know the rules and would do everything possible to disrupt your journey. I had a valid ETA to fly through Canada to go to US (final destination) but the staff in Madrid had no idea how the visa works and their solution was to tell me to go to a Canadian consulate because I made the mistake of flying Air Canada.",28th October 2017,Business,Economy Class,Madrid to San Francisco via Toronto,Oct-17,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,71
710,tickets any good to change dates,S Kamargan,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Ft Lauderdale. Because of a health emergency we had to fly back earlier. Called Air Canada if our return tickets were any good to change dates and was told no. Asked what will it cost us to fly back with the first available flight. She said the evening flight was available and one way ticket for two  will cost us $1250 from Ft.Lauderdale to Toronto. I called AA for a Miami to Toronto one way, economy one way $144/person business class $350/person. Purchased 2 business class tickets flew back that evening with a superb service, neat & clean aircraft. I don't know how many times we have taken AC flights where not once we flew with a relaxed or uninterrupted journey.

712,No one apologized to us,Z Binassein,VerifiedReview,"  Ottawa to Amsterdam via Frankfurt. Our flight to Amsterdam was supposed to be via Toronto with the total trip duration of fewer than 11 hours but we ended up with a 22 hours trip. There was about a 3-hour delay in our first flight segment from Ottawa to Toronto, and unfortunately, they could not manage to put some passengers on the two other flights departing in the period of delay. Therefore since our connection time at Toronto airport was 2 hours, we missed our flight from Toronto to Amsterdam and we were offered an alternate route to Amsterdam via Frankfurt. The staff at the airport were rude  in providing a concrete solution and were very reluctant to respond us. The customer service is all about their priority rather than customers' problems. During the first part of the flight, the service and food were terrible.  We only had one option and that was a vegetarian meal, when I politely asked for another option, the crew rudely emphasized that that is all we have. One of our baggage was missed when we arrived Amsterdam and later on they sent it to us. No one from Air Canada apologized to us or provided us any compensation.",21st October 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to Amsterdam via Frankfurt,Oct-17,2,1,1,2,1,0,1,72

My husband I were supposed to sit beside each other middle and isle. Which by the way I confirmed two weeks earlier. Well we end up sitting one in front of the other. No one said anything until we looked at our ticket. Not to mention we got checked in at the premium/business class desk. Not impressed at this action by Air Canada. Waist of my time and money.

715,I was left stranded,O Worzek,VerifiedReview,"  Windsor to Montreal via Toronto. When I checked in online, I noticed there were only a few people on the flight. Surprisingly enough, about 7 hours before the flight I looked up the flight status to learn that my flight was canceled. When I called Air Canada and asked the reason for the cancellation they claimed ""Air Traffic Congestion in Toronto"" and said they didn't want to operate the flight with a delay. The agent then tried to charge me $14 to choose my seat on the rebooked itinerary. I was left stranded with no compensation until the next flight the following day.",18th October 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Windsor to Montreal via Toronto,Oct-17,1,2,1,2,1,0,1,72
716,We tried to file a complaint,Ken Waldroup,VerifiedReview,"  Charlotte to Gander via Toronto. I am one of 6 in our group that have the same complaints. In Charlotte, Air Canada charged us an antler/horn fee of $150 instead of a $50 firearms fee when we checked our guns for a Moose hunting trip to Newfoundland. They tried to tell us since we had rifles that we had to pay an antler/horn fee because they were hunting equipment and they no longer fall in the firearm category. We even got a TSA agent to try help us talk sense into the girls at the bag check but they wouldn't listen. Then we were told our luggage would go direct to Gander but we had to check guns in Toronto thru customs. Every person that we talked to employed by Air Canada gave us a different story concerning our guns and our luggage. In Toronto instead of bringing the guns out to us for an ID check we found them in the baggage claim area that anyone could have picked them up. Then in Toronto customs we saw all our luggage stacked in the corner that we were told would go straight to Gander. Also Toronto customs only had 2 people working the 15 check stations and 40 people were lined up for connecting flights and we barely made ours. We checked our luggage and guns again but when we got to Gander all 9 bags including our guns were lost. We missed a full day of a $4300 hunt waiting on luggage and guns. They didn't make it to the airport until the next evening. Then on the return trip home to Charlotte we were charged the correct firearm fee but we watched a girl throw our gun case on the carousel in Charlotte. Hard enough it hit and bounced almost off and another passenger caught it and placed it back on the carousel. These are very expensive guns and scopes. Also she did not bring the guns to us and check our ID to release them to us as she was supposed to. Anyone could have taken them again. We tried to file a complaint at the airport and talked to her supervisor and he said he would reprimand her as that was uncalled for but that we would have to file an online complaint. Also a brand new luggage bag came back with the handle ripped off. And the flight from Toronto to Charlotte had a problem with the fan that pressurizes the cabin so it was so hot on the plane you couldn't breath. It did get better as we flew but the pilot had to fly at a low altitude according to the flight attendants because of the cabin pressure issue. With the treatment we received from start to finish I wonder how an airlines could exist like this.

717,"Very nice flight, as usual",T Jackson,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Ottawa. Very nice flight, as usual. Bulkhead seats with limited space as usual but still OK.

718,disorganization in regards to baggage,Nathan Gauthier,VerifiedReview,"  Vancouver to Victoria. I feel the need to leave a comment here in regards to the disorganization that Air Canada has in regards to baggage. I was delayed and missed our connecting flight home due to customs. I had asked every attendant or working persons that we had dealings with about whether I needed to get my luggage and everyone stressed due not worry about it. And like many would be, I was. I work hard for a living to have nice things, some of those of which I had brought on our trip.  There is no system in place and the bag never made it back home. I have been calling into what seems to be a secondary bag check line with zero information as to where it is. I am being told it is still in tracking mode. How is there not a better system with bag tags.",7th October 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Victoria via Vancouver,Oct-17,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,72
719,Everything was okay except the food,Claudio Rallo,VerifiedReview,"  Frankfurt to Ottawa (after flying Lufthansa from Amsterdam to Frankfurt). I have flown this route many times via London but this time Air Canada only gave the option to transit in Frankfurt. Originally I had a good two-hour and a half transit time in Frankfurt but because the Lufthansa plane got delayed in Amsterdam the transit time got less and so I had to kinda rush to get to the gate. Going back to my flight experience, it didn't differ much from my previous ones. Everything was just okay except the food which is always below standards. The Boeing 767-300ER is an excellent plane, however it does feel a bit like it has done its time and I wonder when Air Canada will replace it with the 787 on the Ottawa-Europe routes.",7th October 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Ottawa,Oct-17,4,4,2,5,4,0,5,72
720,Very basic needs met,H Mears,VerifiedReview,"  Ottawa to Vancouver. Very basic needs met however the airline doesn't care about customer service or high quality service. Very limited leg room and additional legroom costs $40.

We were traveling on award tix. Focusing on the business segment Montreal to Florence, the seats, bedding, meals, and service were all quite excellent. Crew were competent and friendly; the seats and lie-flat beds comfortable. Our seats across from each other didn't allow for a lot of discourse - I had the left side ""single-ish"" seat and my husband was center seat oriented toward right side, but as a night flight it worked for us.

723,seats are so uncomfortable,H Gujar,VerifiedReview,  Toronto to Delhi. I flew the Boeing 787-9 on a long 14 hour flight to Delhi. This aircraft is not suitable for long flights. Seat pitch and seats are so uncomfortable that you can barely sleep during flight. Aisles are so narrow that you get bumped by passengers moving back and forth.

724,you have a very special pilot,D Lacina,VerifiedReview,  Toronto to Ottawa. The Pilot was flying out to Ottawa and overheard my conversation and distress of having to get to Ottawa General as my husband was in a coma. I was not sure where to go or how to get there and was worried about how long it would take till I was by my husbands side. This pilot came over to me and offered to bring me to the hospital once he landed the plane as he finished his shift and was going home as he lived in Ottawa. I want say thank you as I was overwhelmed and it took some ease and stress off me from the flight knowing I would not have to worry how I would get to the hospital after the flight. He was very humble and offered me assistance if I need anything while I was in Ottawa. I thanked him for his gracious act of kindness and want to ensure that he gets recognized for doing such a good deed. Air Canada you have a very special pilot.

This was the first time I flew their Montreal to Shanghai route on the Boeing 787. Exceptional service on their international service. I also had a chance to fly Canadian domestic on the YYZ->YUL leg. Even though the flight was short, the flight attendants did their best to distribute snacks/drinks in a short timeframe to a plane of 150 people. The transborder flights operated by Georgian airways were also good. The entertainment system worked without flaw and the seats were comfortable.

The flight boarded in an orderly fashion and on board the hard product was terrific offering a very comfortable environment. The FA's were friendly but cordial. The food and beverages were of high quality and there was plenty of choice. The IFE had a good selection of movies and TV programs but the music selection seemed rather abstract. Toilets were kept spotless throughout the journey. The flight departed and landed on time.

Flight left slightly late due to delays with baggage loading as it was raining heavily in Chicago. Nonetheless, the flight arrived Toronto on time. Check in was slower since there were only two agents at the counter with several passengers in line. Yet, the staff was courteous and was very welcoming. We were eligible for TSA PreCheck so we breezed through security with ease. Cabin crew were present for the duration of the flight with the captain giving updates while waiting on ground in Chicago and upon arrival in Toronto. Drinks were served with refills offered twice through. Custom forms handed out during descent. Quick taxi to the gate upon landing and we were quick to deplane. Bags arrived swiftly and we were out of the airport within 15 minutes of clearing immigration at Pearson.

Because of the delay, we missed our flight to Denpasar and wasted 24 hours at a dingy hotel. Money paid for the resort in Bali was down the drain that Air Canada would not compensate at all.

729,this is obviously an airline trying to cut costs,David Thompson,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada. Plane was great, some cabin staff were good and then it went downhill from there. Lounges in Canada were very poor. Staff were generally OK but this is obviously an airline trying to cut costs. Even flying business they wanted to charge me another $500 to bring a flight forward 2 days. I have never been treated wirh such contempt.

730,like flying with a different airline,Mike Palmer,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Boston return on a miles flight. Easy bag drop and security thanks to my partner being 35k elite. Pre clearance is way better since the re-configuration (well done Pearson) and I was in the lounge on a guest pass within 30 mins of entering the airport. Easy boarding and an on time flight with a swift beverage service. On time arrival and fast bags. Sadly the return flight was like flying with a different airline. We checked in 5 mins after the 1 hour cut for hold baggage off due to our ferry being late and the Water Taxi taking longer than expected. (note to self - next time, take a cab). We were denied checking in our bag due to TSA needing an hour to assess the bags. Reminding the check in staff that in May, they were happy to walk the bags through after a double cancellation the response was - that was Runway reconstruction, this is Irma). How a hurricane in the south affected an AC flight from Boston to Toronto was a mystery (other than the obvious abdication of responsibility or helping the customer). The check in staff were sympathetic but the supervisor stood her ground. We weren't allowed to travel without our bags, and the only option was to rebook. The good news was there was room on the next flight two hours later. The bad news - a 75 buck change fee each for the privilege. With no other option we re-booked though they were kind enough to tag our bags as priority. Boarding was efficient but the AC gate area at Boston is in the running for the most cramped and soulness departure gates on the AC network. The flight was fine with the usual beverage service and an on time arrival in Toronto. In the race for maximising profit and cheesing off customers - Air Canada wins first prize. We were 5 mins late for bags - sure. But the officiousness of the check in supervisor and the stinging us financially shows just how little Air Canada cares about good and honest customer service / experience.",16th September 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Boston,Sep-17,2,3,2,3,1,0,4,74
731,service is extremely poor,A Allam,VerifiedReview," I flew from Toronto to Atlanta on Air Canada. The additional charge for checking luggage is unfair.

I am so disappointed in the treatment I received during boarding at the beginning of my vacation today. It really put a sour start to my vacation. There was no room for my carry on luggage because people had bags and coats overhead. I was forced to check my carry on and I had to transfer my things such as medical items and other expensive things into a garbage bag that I had to ask for instead of being offered. During this, the flight attendants threatened to put us on later flight! Never even said sorry! I strongly believe they could have improved the situation by simply checking the overhead storage for small bags and coats and asking others to put it under their seats. They also could have been a little patient. I am currently dragging heavy garbage bags around the airport. They definitely could work on their manners and attitude.",15th September 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St. John's to Las Vega via Toronto,Sep-17,1,3,2,2,1,0,1,74

As I reached the airport, the Air Canada queue was so long, almost 200m or longer. Only 3-4 counters were open and service was so poor. Counter staff were so slow and busy chatting. I cannot understand simple logic why can't Air Canada open more counters. Due to this delay, I almost missed my flight since the US immigration further delayed the entire process. As I reached Philadelphia, my luggage did not arrive on time and Air Canada did not have the courtesy to inform me what is happening. What is so difficult in tracing the luggage? I will try not to use Air Canada in the future. ",15th September 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Philadelphia,Aug-17,4,3,0,0,1,0,1,74

735,customer service was terrible,Denver France,VerifiedReview,  St. Johns to Sarnia via Toronto. The flight and at the terminal were great but the customer service was terrible. Originally there was supposed to be a hour overlay between my flights. When I landed they told me my flight was cancelled and that is was rebooked for the next morning. The email did not tell me why it was cancelled and I asked the customer service why and they could not tell and me and to just get a hotel room and submit the bill online to be reimbursed for the expenses. Submit it and they tell me it is not covered because the flight was cancelled due to weather. I understand it is not covered because it says it on their site but why would they not tell me this before I went to the hotel? Now I am out the $180 for the hotel and $200 on the flight that could have cancelled and got a rental car that would have costed me $60 instead because that customer service rep and the airport didn't tell me why it was cancelled.,12th September 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St. Johns to Sarnia via Toronto,Aug-17,3,3,0,1,3,2,1,74

The agent was warm and polite and efficiently processed our check in. Used the domestic Maple Leaf Lounge which is in dire need of a facelift. Good food and beverage options but pizza was cold. On board the aircraft looked tired. My wife's IFE screen did not work as the tactile function had to be recalibrated. This resulted in no IFE for her for the entire flight. Similarly, my son's headphone jack was broken and my screen had multiple scratches all over it. The FA's bordered on surly and went about their duties as if they were doing us a favour.

The last row of our 2 seats did not recline very much at all. Not all seats in this cabin are created equal. Air Canada did not tell us this about this configuration. Our overnight flight was one of the worst we encountered. The 2 seats in front reclined right to our chests. The people in front were reclined and legs were fully stretched and they slept the whole flight We struggled with the reclined seats at our chest and struggled to get comfortable, I had difficulty getting in and out. I am a fairly fit person who had to throw my legs over the arm rest to stand up due to the seat in front reclined into my chest. Our legs were cramped. I traded seats with my daughter a few times. She was in the economy bulkhead seat right behind us. It had more space overall than our $400 seat. We were definitely ripped off by Air Canada. They should refund us the money.

740,new pathway thru customs,B Sachin,VerifiedReview,"  La Guardia to Halifax via Montreal. Thank you Air Canada for instituting this new (since November) pathway thru customs in Montreal to connecting flights! Now I did not have to wait on a long line at customs with all other passengers arriving in Montreal from NY, but was directed to a separate area for customs for connecting flights only, (brilliant), and when I exited customs I was in the gate area for my connecting flight - without having to go thru security again - brilliant. This saves so much time when one may have only a minimal amount of time to make a connecting flight, especially given regular delays! It is so much better, and truly customer-centred. But can you institute this at Toronto airport, too? And also can u make it happen in the reverse direction in Montreal?

743,not one flight on time,G Darwin,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Chicago. I fly on Air Canada two to three times per month, mostly to Chicago but also domestically and internationally. It is now the end of August and not one flight in 2017 has been on time. There are not always reasons given, but the result is always the same. Not only has this negatively impacted my business, it has also affected the impression that others have of me. Lateness has become an acceptable trend with this airline. Flights later in the afternoon and evening have no chance of being on time due to delays earlier in the day. As I sit in my seat trying to deal with the implications of being late once again, I am forced to listen to the cabin crew tell me that are the best airline in North America. I have now booked my first flight in 2017 with another airline and will be doing so whenever possible in the future.",1st September 2017,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Chicago,Aug-17,4,2,2,3,1,0,2,75
744,would and will fly again,D Harris,VerifiedReview," Most are accustomed to seeing very negative reviews of Air Canada, but this review is for a flight almost boringly smooth. I fly Air Canada a lot and I've never had an issue. This time was on a red eye from Toronto to Calgary. The flight was on time. It was a rebooked flight and I was given complimentary preferred seats. We landed in Calgary ahead of schedule. The entertainment system had some issues but the 320s are older members of the AC fleet and will be replaced by the new Bombardier C Series soon (looking forward to that). Cabin crew was attentive and gave me extras of things. Would and will fly again.",31st August 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Calgary,Aug-17,4,5,5,4,5,0,5,75
745,staff friendly and courteous,D Harris,VerifiedReview," This flight from Sydney (Canada) to Toronto was delayed by several hours due to a mechanical issue. Another plane was flown in and the replacement flight was boarded quickly and underway immediately. Air Canada airport staff was friendly and courteous. We were given meal vouchers and a discount code for a future flight. The plane itself was clean and the flight smooth. No complaints - better safe than sorry when it comes to plane issues (not to mention legally mandated), and they handled it very well.",30th August 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney (Canada) to Toronto,Aug-17,4,5,5,5,5,0,4,75
746,an efficient and friendly cabin crew,D Hoskin,VerifiedReview,"  We were placed on this flight from Ottawa to Halifax after our initial connection was cancelled. We were given meal vouchers for lunch, and this replacement flight left fairly much on time and went without a hitch. A short flight in the small Bombardier, served by an efficient and friendly cabin crew. No issues, would fly again.",30th August 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to Halifax ,Aug-17,4,5,5,0,5,0,4,75
747,know your service and product,Mike Palmer,VerifiedReview,"  Air Canada Express operated by Jazz from Billy Bishop Airport to Montreal return. Easy check in, on time departure which was good given the flight was full. The route has recently switched from Sky Regional to Jazz though the product is the same - snacks and a full bar. Excellent crew - really funny, engaging and gave me a double with a smile. Excellent landing, good PAs from the flight deck and an on time arrival at the gate in Montreal. Return was different in the sense that the crew were just about friendly and no announcements from the flight deck throughout. Confused service as the Purser initially tried charging for drinks - know your service and product! Full flight again and an on time departure but unusually bad landing into Toronto City. Toronto City to Montreal with AC Regional remains my favourite service within Canada. If only Air Canada would up the coach inflight service on other domestic flights rather than continue to cut costs and race to low cost carrier status.",30th August 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto City to Montreal,Aug-17,3,4,4,0,4,0,4,75
748,shambles of an airline,M Ross,VerifiedReview," What an absolute shambles of an airline, will never fly with these again. Flight from Bogota was delayed by 3 hours which meant I missed my connecting flight from Toronto to London. Landed in Toronto at 12am and was given a new flight 24 hours later. This wasn't good enough as i had to get another flight in England, so I went to customer service and was told I would most likely get on the 9am flight as a standby passenger. Turned up at the airport at 5am after 2 hours sleep and checked in, when I got to the gate for boarding the flight was apparently full. Went back to customer service and they told me the next available flight was the one they had given me in the first place. I went online to the Air Canada website and searched earlier flights and there was one 5 hours earlier that they were still selling tickets for. I queried this with customer services advisor and he said it was overbooked by 16 seats, yet they were still selling tickets for $5000 online? He told me that I could book a ticket online if I wanted to pay that much but he couldn't put me on that flight. It's ok though because they gave me a $15 meal voucher to apologise for my 15 hour wait in the airport. What an absolute joke. Best part of the journey was the hotel I was put up in, despite only being in there for 3 hours.",29th August 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bogota to London via Toronto,Aug-17,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,75
749,"caused us to miss our connecting flight
",Zackary Savoie,VerifiedReview,"  Our flight from Seattle to Toronto via Vancouver was delayed for nearly an hour which caused us to miss our connecting flight even though we were assured by Air Canada representatives that they would wait. We were then given 15$ food vouchers and standby tickets for the next flight (an hour later). That flight was full and the next flight was at 22.30. A delay of around 7 hours since our original was to leave at 4.15. We asked Air Canada representatives for compensation and they gave us a measly 10$ food voucher which isn't even enough for a sandwich at this airport. When 22.30 finally arrived we were stuffed in economy class on a full flight and upon arrival were informed that our baggage was not to arrive until 8.30 the next day! So we left the airport 7 hours late with no baggage. And for having missed the birth of our cousin we get 25$ in food vouchers. To make matters worse, we missed the pre-arranged transportation we had booked and didn't receive any vouchers for this 154$ trip.",28th August 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Toronto via Vancouver,Aug-17,2,2,3,4,1,1,1,75
750,had an awful experience,N Perez,VerifiedReview,"  Milan to Toronto. We had an awful experience with the check-in at Milan,  he had an arrogant attitude towards my husband. When weighing our luggage, mine was 20kg and my husband’s was 26 kg, as limit per person is 23kg, normally in those cases they have told us is ok and there is no overweight. After doing the long line to pay the extra 3 kilos, they told my husband he could have put the 3kg in my luggage, solution that was not given to us in that moment. We went back and my husband told the guy he could be nicer and also could have told us about the 3 kilos change of luggage, I was going to speak and he said ok if you continue complaining I cancel your flight and call the police.  Arrogance and threatening are not what you expect in these cases.  When telling other staff members, they said you can go and complain on the web page but refused to give me the name.",27th August 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Toronto,Aug-17,3,3,0,0,1,0,3,76
751,cancelled due to weather,Warren Walstra,VerifiedReview,  Houston to Calgary. Our flight was cancelled due to weather conditions caused by hurricane Harvey. Air Canada cancelled their flights too early when weather conditions were barely a slight drizzle. Ticket counter was very unhelpful and gave no guidance for all passengers. Makes it difficult to be proud of our national carrier. A legitimate explanation would be great.,26th August 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Calgary,Apr-17,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,76
752,failed to provide wheelchairs,S Hauravan,VerifiedReview,"  Saskatoon to Toronto. If you are in Canada and want to fly, you lack options! Only Air Canada and WestJet. I flew to India in April and May this year. While coming back to Canada I had my parents with me and because of their old age and my father's nerve problem in his feet, I asked for a wheelchair facility for both. They failed to provide wheelchairs both in Delhi and in Toronto. I filed a complain and after that they gave me a CAD 400 discount on my next booking. So, I booked flights for three of us to go to Toronto (return ticket). Don't take me wrong. Air Canada on international routes is pretty good. The crew are helpful and food is good. Good entertainment options! Legroom is small but its economy! However, their domestic route flights are the worst I have seen. No food or drinks offered on long haul flights (Saskatoon-Toronto takes 3.5 hours). Legroom small. Sometimes no entertainment system (Saskatoon-Vancouver/Calgary routes). They need to be more friendly towards customer. Offer more options inflight.",25th August 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Saskatoon to Toronto,Jul-17,2,3,3,3,3,1,1,76
753,cabin staff was very pleasant ,Han Ding,VerifiedReview,"  Calgary to Ottawa. A slightly delayed flight was thoroughly explained over the PA twice and the cabin staff was very pleasant in their service, getting the drinks going right away and answering my 'call flight attendant' ring within seconds. Economy seats were obviously not the most comfortable but of course they're not designed by the airline, so it's not quite relevant to reviewing Air Canada. Smooth flight overall - have never had an issue with them on countless flights over many years.",25th August 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Ottawa,Aug-17,4,5,5,5,5,0,4,76
754,cabin staff were professional,P Chen,VerifiedReview,"  I was looking forward to this trip from Los Angeles to Taipei via Vancouver. The flight from Los Angeles to Vancouver was on a newer A330. Each seat had its own personal entertainment system, and meal service included dinner and light snacks. The flight to Taipei did not depart until the next morning so I spent the night at a hotel close to Vancouver Airport (Pacific Gateway which also has a free shuttle between the airport and hotel). The flight from Vancouver to Taipei was on a Boeing 787, seat configuration was 3-3-3. Sat in economy. Unfortunately the room between my seat and the row ahead was very limited. I'm 5 foot 10 inches (about 170 cm) and even without the seat in front of me not reclining, my knees was making contact with the seat back pocket and it contents. Needless to say this made for a very uncomfortable 12 hour flight. The cabin could've used a deep cleaning as I was siting by the window and noticed all the dust bunnies clumped up on the side vents above me. The cabin staff were professional and could not be faulted. On the return flight I paid extra to sit in the bulkhead section (Approximately $60 Canadian). This made all the difference in terms of seat comfort. The cabin staff were also professional. All cabin announcements were made in 3 languages: English, French, and Chinese-Mandarin. At Vancouver Airport, all US bound passengers go through US customs and immigration checks inside Vancouver Airport--so when the flight arrives stateside, I was able to pick up my luggage in domestic arrivals which was a plus. The final leg from Vancouver to Los Angeles was operated by United. Anyone who has flown Eva Air to Taiwan might not be impressed with the Air Canada flight experience, but the price was very competitive when compared to the other airlines that fly between Los Angeles and Taiwan. I would consider flying with Air Canada in the future.",24th August 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Taipei via Vancouver,Jul-17,3,5,3,5,5,0,5,76
755,airline just handled everything very poorly,C Kemp,VerifiedReview,"  Had a horrible experience with Air Canada (and unfortunately not the first). Upon check-in, the lady at the counter informed me the flight was departing on time as scheduled. Thirty minutes later, the first first delay alerts started to come in. Initially, it was a three hour delay, that became 5hr 15min, eventually it settled at a delay of 4hr and 45 minutes. There was no explanation at all given as to the delay, just told to sit and wait. Time went by, and at around 11pm, the airline's lounge started to broadcast that they were closing. With this flight and several other flights of Air Canada delayed by several hours (one delayed by 6 hours), you would think the airline had the courtesy of keeping the lounge open longer in these exceptional circumstances to accommodate the premium passengers and frequent fliers. Finally, it was time to board, and the boarding area was already full of passengers impatient to board the long-delayed flight. Suddenly, the ground staff came on the intercom and announced that the flight would be ""delayed"" until late afternoon of the next day, a ""delay"" of 21hrs. People were obviously very upset and there was chaos. The ground staff tried their best to calm nerves and frustrations, but the worst was the lack of news, lack of updates and lack of announcements what passengers were entitled to during the flight waiting period. As for the cancellation, they announced that they are not in a position to book hotels for people (not even to offer discount vouchers), so hundreds of people had to go off on their own at 1am! Really unfortunate turn of events (not even sure what happened), but the airline just handled everything very poorly with lack of information and lack of compensation or regard for the wellbeing of passengers.",24th August 2017,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Amsterdam,Aug-17,3,3,0,0,2,0,2,76
756,Absolutely horrible customer service,F Andrews,VerifiedReview,"  
My partner and I were returning from a trip from Asia, a 15 hour flight. We were to get a connecting flight in EWR with Air Canada and return to YYZ at 6pm. We made it to EWR with plenty of time to spare and as we were in line to check our baggage, we get a notification that the flight had been cancelled with no further information. There was an AC employee in the area and we asked her about the cancelled flight, she mentioned in passing that the flight got cancelled all the time but we needed to stand in the assistance line to figure out what to do next. We got in line and there was only one rep dealing with an entire cancelled flight. One would think that if a flight gets cancelled, the company would bring on more staff. So, after waiting in line for nearly 2 hours, mind you there were only 4 or 5 people ahead of us, we finally got to the rep, who was incredibly dismissive and borderline rude to us. We were told that because of weather, the flight was cancelled, no other information other than that. I can accept weather can cancel a flight but based on our experiences and the information I found, I suspect we were being lied to. I asked if there was any other information and all I got was a blunt 'No'. All they could do would be to put us on standby for a flight at 9.35pm and we would have no idea if we could get on that or not. If that failed, the next flight we could be on was 8.35am the next day. When I asked if there were any other airlines that AC could put us on, a blunt 'No'. When I asked if AC would put us up in a hotel, another blunt 'No'. When asked if there was any compensation, he blurted out 'nope' in almost a happy way. Absolutely horrible customer service. My partner has priority pass, so we thought we could wait in the AC lounge. We showed up at the lounge, tried to get in, the rep there informed us in a way that he almost seemed to take pleasure from, that the lounge was only open to priority pass members until 3pm. The next flight, ended up getting delayed, we asked the rep at the counter a couple times if there was any status on the standby list, the last time we asked, which was close to 11pm, they told us they would tell us in two minutes, 30 seconds later they called out at list of names, didn't explain what it was and left us completely in the dark. It turns out that everybody that was on standby, except for us got a seat on the plan. When I went up to ask what was going on, they told me that the plane was full, maybe, just maybe if we waited a little while longer, we might be able to get on. It turns out there was another couple waiting on standby that had already been bumped 4 times before us that day. We waited until probably around 11.30pm. The rep found that two people hadn't checked in so we did have seats! He rushed us on board and we got into the first two seats that were available, they happened to be in business class. They seemed a bit confused at first and then realised that the tickets were for seats in economy, the first rep told us not to worry about it but then this horribly unfriendly flight attendant came up to us and told us that we we would have to move. We said okay, grabbed our belongings quickly and started to look for our seats, at this time the flight attendant yells out at us 'just take your seat, we'll sort it out in the air' - well that's great, she is the one that forced us to move, meanwhile embarrassing us in front of everybody in the plane.

757,not okay with the ticket lady,Glen Jones,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to Shanghai. Worst customer service ever. I flew in at 1:00 am, slept in the airport, then tried to check my luggage so I could eat and move through TSA. Went through three different people telling where to go after looking at my ticket. The ticket line was crazy but they were pulling people who had flights closer than the people around them. I was asked about six times when my flight was and waited in line for about an hour and thirty minutes. I am okay with people being pulled to pass me if they were going to miss my flight. I make it to the counter and the lady I spoke to looked at me and made a loud ""annoyed"" sound and asked, ""why are you here."" Explained everything and was cut off with her moving her arms rushing me away. When I asked why several people would have sent me through the line if it was too early to check my bags, she informed me she did not know, she was not them. I am okay with not being able to check my bags, I am okay with waiting in line, I am not okay with the ticket lady.",14th August 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Shanghai,Aug-17,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,76

My family and I were flying Business class. Our luggage came very fast! Our flight back to Montreal from the Bahamas with a connection in Toronto was a disaster. First of all, the flight was late with no explanations, then when we got to Toronto, we almost missed the flight to Montreal. When we finally got to Montreal (at almost 3 am), we waited for about 30-45 minutes with no luggage! Half the people on the plane didn't have their belonging! There was a sea of unclaimed luggage! We submitted papers and got home at 4h30 am, we got 3 of 4 bags the next day, it took a week for them to find my luggage with no compensation.

It was freezing in the airplane and when we asked for a blanket they said you have to pay 7 dollars for a blanket. And they only accepted credit cards although we had canadian dollars. So I had to pay in Euro from my credit card. And of course they didn't have any complimentary meals or snacks in a 5 hour flight.

My return flight was a couple hours late which made me miss my connection in Vancouver, I was told by the ticket agents before I flew to Vancouver that once I get to Vancouver at Midnight that Air Canada would provide me with a hotel and meal voucher. Once I got to Vancouver I went to Air Canada Customer Service and was told by their less than caring agent that they will not provide me with a hotel and that I could find a pillow and blanket at baggage claim.

761,!whole experience was below average,R Allen,VerifiedReview," I generally write reviews when I feel like there is a reason to commend or perhaps criticize an airline. Today I regretfully flew with Air Canada again from Vancouver to Montreal. We arrived 90 min prior to our domestic flight. The lines were especially long, and most kiosks for check in were busy. I went ahead to check us in and unsuccessfully an error receipt came out. I was forced to go into the check in line which had a wait time of 35 min. We got to the front of the line and found out that the flight was over booked and they wanted to put us on the next flight out. I was livid - how could they overbook the flight that we paid for? The Air Canada representative also had the audacity to mention that we were running late. After I firmly mentioned that I cannot get on the next flight, they magically found two seats right by one another. A miracle really. On my way from Montreal to Vancouver, I also did not have a pleasant experience. I had one carry on luggage. The front desk staff at the gate came specifically to me and asked to check it in for no charge because they had a full flight, and not enough space for the carry on luggage. I had some personal belongings that I wanted to carry on board, and in addition, I wanted to forego waiting for the checked in baggage to arrive in Vancouver. She relentlessly asked that I check it in, giving me no option even though many others had carry on bags of the same size that were not being checked in. I felt bullied into checking it in. The whole experience prior to take off each time was below average and I will not fly Air Canada again.",8th August 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Vancover,Aug-17,1,2,1,1,1,0,1,77

I was travelling with my 6-year old grandson. AC took great care of him. Quality of food was good, responsiveness of cabin crew was excellent, seat comfortable and flight was on time. My baggage was delayed, but that was the fault of another airline on the previous segment. Air Canada has upped its game on long-haul flights in their premium cabins. Air Canada uses the LH lounge in DXB which is quite nice, including good showers. My only complaint was the long wait on the gangway for boarding as there was no separate gangway for business class passengers.",4th August 2017,Family Leisure,Business Class,Dubai to Toronto,Jul-17,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,77

The guy said ""I'm too busy if you want to switch your next connection you'll have to cancel this current one and wait because I need these computers open"". I had to call Air Canada with my phone to even get help but unfortunately no other options by that point.

My flight from Toronto to LaGuardia was delayed because of a thunder storm and we waited for hours. Eventually the call was made that the flight was to be rescheduled. Everyone de-boarded the flight and after much confusion and racing back and forth through the airport to the customer service desk 3 times we all had to reboard the plane. No vouchers or apologies were given. Sloppy customer service and angry customers all around.

767,change was poorly communicated,R Starmer,VerifiedReview,"  Calgary to Havana via Toronto, with a 2 hour stopover in Toronto. Air Canada changed the second leg of the flight to the next day, creating a 26 hour layover. This change was poorly communicated, with only a single email consisting of an attached PDF file with two digits changed in the entire document. Air Canada did not request consent for this change, offer alternatives, or confirm my understanding of the change. I contacted Air Canada to rectify this, and they were able to change the first portion of the flight so that both flights were on the same day, as originally booked. However, they charged a $75 fee for this, without informing me that they would do so. When I attempted to discuss this with their customer service line, I was informed that I could not speak to anyone about this. I was informed that it is impossible to discuss these issues verbally, and that email is the only avenue to address my concerns.

768,Still waiting for the call,E Roscher,VerifiedReview,"  London to Vancouver. Flight attendants busy talking about private issues while delivering lunch, not paying attention to passengers. The lunch food in comparison to Asian or European airlines is on the lower end of the spectrum. Arrival: Missing suitcase, were advised that it will arrive a day late. Delivery company engaged by Air Canada, did not deliver two days later (still waiting and only living 50 minutes from airport). Air Canada Baggage Care Centre advised that suitcase arrived and had been picked up by delivery company. Delivery company made no attempt to contact customer. 5 calls were left unanswered. Air Canada has no further control over delivery and unable to provide a direct status of luggage.  A request to speak to a supervisor at AC Baggage Care Centre was answered that a supervisor has no direct line to be called. A further verbal request was answered that a supervisor was calling back within 30 minutes.

769,enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants,Samy-George Salib,VerifiedReview,"  I understand all of the negative reviews regarding the seat layout of 3-4-3. However, I recognize that the flight crew have no control over this. However, what I don't get is the enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants that constantly bump into aisle seat passengers as they move up and down the cabin. Facts: 1) Took AC5 from Toronto to Tokyo with my family on July 2nd, 2017. Returned on from Tokyo to Toronto on Flight AC6 - July 23rd, 2017. Both times we were seated in Aisle 41. My two kids had the window and centre seats, my wife had the aisle seat next to them, and I had the aisle next to my wife's, as we were divided by the pathway that people take up and down the cabin. 2) My elbow rested on the armrest no different than any other passengers in the cabin. To ensure true obectivity, my body size, position and posture made absoltutey no difference, as (when the issue persisted) I studied in depth whether or not I may have been the problem. My findings were that my shoulder, arm and elbow did not extend beyond the armrest as much as a millimeter further than any of the other passengers seated in the first few rows ahead, as well as behind me. 3) I cannot count the exact amount of times when the attendants banged into me when they walked past, either with or without their walking carts - forwards or backwards. What I can tell you however, is that it occurred about 15-20 times on both flights. In fact, there may have been only about 3 occasions where I no contact was made when they walking by. Some of the incidents involved them ""brushing"" along me - easily enough to wake someone uo who is sleeping. Other incidents were downright collisions - where their buttocks banged into my arm as they walked in reversed with their carts. Passengers going to and from the washroom managed to avoid these incidents. 4) Not one apology or even acknowledgement that they banged into me, or my wife, or two other passengers in the rows ahead of us that were equally annoyed. I can't speak further passengers throughout the cabin. No effort was made by the attendants to exercise the slightest bit of caution or consideration towards me, my wife and two other passengers (one being a petite female - no more than 110 pounds). There is no possible way the attendants could not feel the sensation of colliding with other passengers, yet they clearly chose not to react or respond. It's as if they have given up due to the narrow walkway layout they have been given to work with, and are almost making a statement that there was nothing that could be done about it. 4) During our vacation, we took four domestic flights within Japan via ANA Airlines. The walking path provided to their flight attendants differed minimally (if at all), yet their crew managed to make every effort to not disturb their passengers as they made their way up and down the aisles throughout the flights. In fact, there were no incidents. Their standards were much higher, and they truly went the extra mile to ensure that passengers were comfortable and well taken care of. 5) I'm a reasonable person and don't feel the need ""Go to town"" on every ratable indicator about my flight experience (i.e. food, seat comfort, in-flight entertainment), but the lack of care, effort and empathy regarding this particular matter was enough to turn me off from this airline. Our family will only be looking at other airlines in the future.",26th July 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Toronto,Jul-17,2,1,2,3,4,2,2,77
770,not very helpful,A Marden,VerifiedReview,"  Vancouver to Sydney. Cabin crew wasn't happy and not very helpful. Meals need to be a lot better when you are paying for premium economy. Plastic knife and forks, paper cup. It was like a big rush to get everything done. The snack during the flight, we had no choice. A sandwich was handed to us without a choice, didn't tell us what was on them.  Our seats were good. Services was bad. And spraying the cabin before we got off.

771,the flight was cancelled,Louise Machen,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Baltimore. In 20 years of taking this flight, Air Canada has not once gotten off on time. This time the flight was cancelled. Air Canada offers no help - standing in a line of hundreds to make a phone call and be put on hold for an hour does not count. I ended up spending almost $1000 to get home the next day. Flying Air Canada is a tense and frustrating experience. ",23rd July 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Baltimore,Jul-17,3,5,3,0,1,0,1,78
772,major disappointment,T Reynolds,VerifiedReview," I recently flew Air Canada business class from NYC LGA to Toronto YYZ. Granted this is a short flight of about 1.5 hours but I expected more from a global airline such as this. Generally, I don't rush to board early because my luggage is usually checked. Also, boarding early just means I have to sit and wait longer as everyone slowly boards the plane and settles into their seats. Air Canada groups zones 1 and 2 together for one queue and 3 and 4 together in the other queue. Needless to say, this is very inefficient and confusing because people in zone 2 are standing on the line (early, mind you) waiting to board mixed in with zone 1 (business class) passengers. When they started boarding, some people just stood there and didn't move. That's because they were zone 2. So zone 1 passengers had to ask the person in front of them if they were moving or not and then proceed to walk ahead of them if they were zone 2. The boarding process is very backwards and makes no sense. After about 15 minutes, I was ready to board. The gate agent scanning tickets of passengers had his back to the queues. Which meant he would not see me if I walked up to the zone 1 and 2 queue. So I wound up standing in line with the zone 3 and 4 passengers. On other airlines, I would be able to walk right up and the gate agents would see me and take me right away because they would be facing the queues. Once onboard, I took my seat. And waited at least 10 minutes before a flight attendant asked me if I wanted something to drink. The FA working the business class section was standing by the door and greeting passengers with another FA, completely oblivious to the fact that I had just taken the last seat in business class. Shouldn't her focus be on the business class passengers? For this short trip, all they offered was a ""snack"" consisting of a slice of cheese and various cold cut meats. The flight departed at 11:05 am and was expected to land at 12:40 pm. I was expecting some kind of a light lunch, not light snack. The return flight was a complete mess whereby they checked me in ""so quickly"" that the systems didn't have enough time to catch up with the immigration system. Being a Global Entry customer, I was turned away by a US Immigrations Officer and asked to go sit in a waiting area so that my flight check in information would ""catch up"" with the other systems. I sat in this room nearby waiting for my name to pop up on a screen. It never happened because an Air Canada employee who directed me to this room remembered me and asked to see my ticket. I gave it to her and she scanned it on one of their machines. And I was cleared. If she hadn't walked into that room, I would've sat there waiting for my name to pop up on some screen and wasted more time! I was considering Air Canada for future Asian and / or European trips but after experiencing this, I am not flying them ever again.

773,no agent to meet the plane,E Wardell,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to Shanghai. I am a long-time and generally loyal Air Canada customer, but they will lose my business now. The flight left Montreal 35 minutes late ( no reason given) and docked 1hr35min late in Shanghai, with a 2 hr connection to my Thai Airways flight to Bangkok. I had only carry-on, so no luggage problem, but there was no Air Canada agent to meet the plane and escort me to the connecting gate (I had to go through immigration and then security again). Missed the connection to Bangkok by 5 minutes and then there was no Air Canada agent available anywhere in Shanghai to rebook me or to assist in getting overnight accommodations. Finally after many calls and hours with AC in Canada, I managed to get rebooked the following day. ",20th July 2017,Business,Business Class,Montreal to Shanghai,Apr-17,1,4,2,0,1,0,2,78

Return flight unpleasant experience with staff at YYC over moving to an earlier flight if there was room. The connection gets cancelled in Toronto and on standby list for later flight and confirmed to that flight an hour later. Ask the attendant if our bags need to be transferred. She ensured they would be fine and be on the flight. Flight gets delayed. Finally get to Columbus 4.5 hours late, no bags to be found. File for lost baggage with agent on duty. Call today to see where everything stands and they have no record of the filing.

775,staff simply do not care,W Carter,VerifiedReview," Every single Air Canada segment of this return trip from London to Calgary via Kelowna was delayed. The staff were rude on the Air Canada flights. Check-in staff in London extremely rude and abrupt. Check in counter system went down when trying to check in and was told by the staff that this happens every day at the same time, when all the Air Canada flights depart at the same time. Air Canada Lounge in London far too small for the number of flights all departing near enough at the same time. Boarding the plane in London, ticket system went down again and delayed everyone boarding. What has happened to Air Canada? Business class seat a vast improvement on their previous Boeing 777 version, but still not brilliant. As an example of what Air Canada has become, the pre-dinner nuts were served in a tiny paper cup - the sort that you normally put ketchup into at fast food outlets. BA, Lufthansa, etc use fine china.

776,it did not disappoint,B Stanton,VerifiedReview,"  Beijing to Denver via Vancouver. When I was looking for round trips from Beijing to Denver and vice versa, this was one of the cheapest flights I came across, even cheaper than the US airlines, and it did not disappoint! With comfortable seats, a nice selection of the latest movies and TV shows, and decent airline food, I would pick this over airlines like United Airlines any day. Also, the plane did an amazing and efficient job at letting the passengers out the plane. The only complaints I had were rather minor, one being that whenever the crew announced something, they would do it in 3 different languages, meaning you had to wait 3 times as long for your movie to play again, and also Canada's inefficient system of transferring layovers for people going to the US. Other than that, I recommend it.",14th July 2017,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Beijing to Denver via Vancouver,Jul-17,4,4,4,5,5,0,4,78
777,connecting flight was canceled,L Reece,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Detroit. After a red eye from Calgary to Toronto, the connecting flight to Detroit orginially scheduled for 8:50 AM was canceled. I was told to go to the Air Canada service desk where, understandably, at 5:30 in the morning, they were understaffed. When I was sent to another desk and finally helped, I had been rebooked for a flight to Detroit two days later. Thankfully the worker continued to check and found a 5 PM flight on the same day. I was given $20 in vouchers (which I now know over a 12 hour time span can be spent very quickly). When it was time to leave, there was an announcement made that our flight attendant could not be found and therefore we did not know our new time of departure. It was discovered later that she had gone through the wrong side in customs and the flight crew had to go through customs again; the wait was about an hour before we were seated on the plane. We then had to fish out a bag from the hold, wait to taxi for 15 minutes, and the icing on the cake was a wheel broken off of my new suitcase.  The staff were patient and kind but I hope to not fly Air Canada again if I can help it.",12th July 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Detroit,Jul-17,3,3,0,0,3,0,2,78
778,enjoyed the service in premium economy,John Peters,VerifiedReview," Our flight from Copenhagen to Toronto left and arrived on time. My wife and I enjoyed the service in the premium economy cabin which consists of only three rows. The premium economy class entitles one to priority boarding and baggage. First meal served was very good but the second consisting of a nondescript wrap should not have been offered. Overall a good experience. AC also provided very obliging service when we needed to change our connecting flight to Calgary. Although a word of caution - AC agent in Copenhagen informed us that we could not check our luggage through only to Toronto and the first question we were asked by AC personnel was whether we had only checked the bags through to YYZ. They said that in Canada so-called ""short checking"" was no problem, while no less than two check-in agent in Copenhagen told us that this was impossible. AC really needs to address this confusion regarding baggage rules which seems to be quite common.",10th July 2017,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Copenhagen to Toronto,Jul-17,4,4,4,3,2,0,4,78

780,staff wasn't really concerned,Paul Hiram,VerifiedReview,  The flight was delayed by a couple of hours making my connection flight to Vancouver hard to get. To make up for the trip interruption Air Canada gave me a $10 food voucher - 10 dollars? That's not good service or showing empathy but shows how cheap the service can be and the staff wasn't really concerned. I am already on an extremely long flight (Bangalore to Vancouver via Frankfurt and Montreal) the next flight I have is 4 hours delayed and 10 dollars is how they show they are concerned.

When we arrived on board, my husband's seat was missing its cushion that was in the overhead above us and was stained. The flight attendants were very nice and tried their best to help us by getting another cushion from a seat in the back. Tray tables and seat pockets had crumbs and the seats were very worn out. Service however was quite friendly and the flight attendants were proactive about offering water after the initial drink service.

784,the food was a bit disappointing,D Wright,VerifiedReview,"  Excellent service from the cabin crew, who greeted passengers by name and quickly offered sparkling wine, water or juice. This was in contrast to service on the ground. The Maple Leaf Lounge was a temporary facility and was overcrowded with poor food and drinks available. I left and used the nearby Plaza Premium lounge. Boarding was a bit chaotic with confusing queues forming 30 minutes before boarding time. The AVOD had a couple of issues, once freezing and going blank and having to be reset. The food was a bit disappointing, with an overcooked tenderloin and a limited wine choice. However, the FAs were superb, making passengers feel genuinely welcome without being intrusive. I know others have had issues with the executive pod seat, but I found it comfortable for both sitting and sleeping.

785,the cabin service was superb,D Wright,VerifiedReview,"  Business class on Air Canada's 787-9 is a noticeable improvement on the 777, which I flew on the outbound portion of a trip to China. The 787's advances in pressurization (the equivalent of about 6,000 feet vs 8,000 on the 777) and humidity meant that I arrived in YVR less tired and dried out than I did in Beijing on the outbound trip. As before, the cabin service was superb and the food was surprisingly better on the PVG-YVR leg than on the YVR-PEK portion, which had touted a ""signature chef."" The electronic window dimming worked well and AVOD was flawless. Boarding was orderly (more so than in YVR) and the Air China lounge was comfortable and quiet, though, as usual in China, with really bad wine. Baggage delivery in YVR took close to 30 minutes after clearing immigration, perhaps because the immigration process was so efficient. Everyone first uses kiosks, which worked well and seemed to reduce what have been huge lines in the past.",6th July 2017,Business,Business Class,Shanghai to Vancouver,Jun-17,5,5,4,5,4,0,4,79

The flight from Calgary to Montreal left and landed on time, and the aircraft was clean. The attendants were polite and made regular rounds through the cabin, with water or food carts (for purchase, as this was a medium-range domestic flight), or just to check. I was in coach so I had the comfort level I paid for (for those complaining about coach comfort, I hope they realise that coach seats are not designed BY the airlines, and that they are less comfortable than premium or business on any airline).

787,"consistent service, polite crew/attendants",D Henderson,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Calgary. Great flight on a clean 787 aircraft in economy. Very friendly attendants: I was sitting beside a couple that was ignoring every instruction. The man was on his phone almost until take off, and neither of them stowed their carry-on during take-off or landing. Despite this, more than one attendant helped them cheerfully. Due to a misunderstanding of when we were landing, I tried to order some food close to landing time. The attendant in my section was polite, explained that they weren't supposed to take any more orders, but then gave me a free sandwich (worth around $6.50 on this domestic flight) to give me the benefit of the doubt. I always have and will continue to fly with AC for their consistent service, polite crew/attendants, and clean/modern fleet.

788,do not respond to call signs at all,S Kitts,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Toronto (YYZ) to Mumbai (BOM) with Air Canada. The experience was very decent and it had slightly surpassed my expectations. The cabin crew were very friendly and hospitable. Since it was a flight to Mumbai, it was really nice that they had cabin crew who could speak in Hindi. However, like my previous experience with Air Canada, the cabin crew do not respond to call signs at all. Regarding meal service, they were quite delicious and well-presented. The food was recognizable. It was very nice of the airline to serve Indian food and beverages like Indian Masala Tea (Chai) and other Indian main course dishes, snacks and deserts. I was served three meals throughout the flight, which included a dinner, snack, and breakfast service. Although there was a limited selection of movies and other forms of in-flight entertainment, I surprisingly did not feel bored during the course of the flight. Flight was certainly eventful. The seat was comfortable with for the long journey with excellent legroom, though the seat recline was not as good as other premium economy classes I have travelled in. Moreover, during the whole flight it was really cold and for a while, after the dinner service, when people are generally sleeping, the main light was still on, which was very disturbing. However, the cabin interior was very clean and the ambience looked great, especially for an inaugural flight. The ground staff at Toronto Pearson Airport were also very nice and helpful. So I hence, would recommend this airline for international (transcontinental) flights.",4th July 2017,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Toronto (YYZ) to Mumbai (BOM),Jul-17,4,4,4,3,4,0,4,79
789,our last resort airline now,D Edwards,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Zurich flight. Flight on time and staff fairly attentive. The on board entertainment has been changed from good present day movies to old ones from the 70's and 80's and 90's with a couple of newer ones thrown in and many foreign films too. The main meal served after take off was plain terrible! There was no choice of food at all! You had to have large macaroni in a tomato sauce and that was it for everyone, its was the worst meal ever served to us by any airline that we have traveled worldwide. If they keep this up they may as well change the whole airline to Rouge because that is the way they are going! On our previous trip we flew with Lufthansa for a similar cost and the service between them and Air Canada is unbelievable!

790,don't fly with Air Canada ,R Wilcox,VerifiedReview,"  Tokyo to Denver via Vancouver. Tokyo to Vancouver was an uneventful flight as you want flights to be. I have no issues with the plane or service on that flight. My issue came in trying to go from Vancouver to Denver. At the last minute Air Canada cancelled our flight. Okay fine. Things happen. (There was no issue with weather in this case.) I'm not upset that the flight was cancelled. I'm upset at how it was handled by airline representatives. First of all, there is no customer service counter for the airline in this part of Vancouver airport, so the entire flight is waiting in a giant line for a mere two representatives to help us rebook. Second, they start handing out a phone number because they said it was faster for us to rebook if we called this number. This is true, and I did call. However, why are they making already frazzled customers do this? Shouldn't they just employ enough agents to handle this sort of thing? As a side note, when I called the number the woman on the phone was very nice and helpful and took the time to answer all my questions.  Third, did my rebooking over the phone, and the agent was very helpful. However, she can't issue me a boarding pass or check me in over the phone. I have to see an agent. She assured me that my baggage would follow me, perhaps not on that same flight, but eventually. I'm on my way home, so I'm okay with this. Fourth, I try to see said agent. If I can get a new boarding pass with enough time, perhaps I can get go get my baggage and get it retagged myself. I have no such luck. I can find 3 Air Canada reps in the entire airport (or at least the part I have access to without going through US customs again.) All 3 are trying to help with rebooking. I wait in line while my husband wanders the airport looking for a person or a kiosk or anything. He finds nothing.  This is where my issue is. The woman trying to rebook everyone literally will not even let me finish a sentence. She says I have to go get my baggage and go through customs again with it retagged. When I tell her that the agent told me over the phone that I would not have to do this, she rolls her eyes and prints me one boarding pass. I need two boarding passes. You see, our new flight was from Vancouver to Seattle and then from Seattle to Denver. The final Seattle to Denver leg was on another airline. She refuses to print me that boarding pass and sends me away with a wave of her hand and will not answer any more questions.  I go to the gate where we are supposed to take off from Vancouver to Seattle. This agent also will not print me another boarding pass. Here's how that exchange went Me: I was wondering if you could print me a boarding - Agent: No. The flight has been downgraded. I don't know if you have a seat. Me: Okay well - Agent: Sit down and I'll page you. (Not sure how she was going to page me without asking my name but what do I know right?) She pages customers being bumped to the next flight. They are unhappy naturally. She is just as snippy with them, not letting anyone finish a sentence. We do make the flight and eventually get home over 6 hours late. We have no bags. Of course there is no Air Canada representative in the Denver airport to speak with. Our final leg was on Alaska Air. I make a lost baggage report with them.  I've been on hold with Air Canada the entire time I've been writing this review.

It seems the airline has finally decided to take their competition seriously and their new hard product is good, and unusually the aircraft was clean and the food was recognizable. The staff were pleasant and they appeared to be trying. One of the massive improvements is that Air Canada allows you to control the temperature via an air vent. The seats on Air Canada have massage and can be adjusted for firmness and softness and the AV screens are large and easy to use.  Air Canada has a long way to go, but at least they appear to be trying to compete, and that can only be good for the flying public.",22nd June 2017,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo Narita to Toronto,Jun-17,5,4,3,4,4,0,5,80

Once in the air, I ordered a Pizza from the onboard menu, and it tasted great.

The seats were very comfortable and the cabin was in excellent condition; very clean and neatly organized. The crew was friendly.

We had recently flew Air Canada earlier in the week with the exact same size carry on pieces and now all of the sudden they were too big to travel with. We showed the check in desk lady that clearly it was an airline standardized measurement and that they fit. She gave us a hard time and eventually allowed us to take them on and not have to check them. When we got on the plane, there was more than enough space for the carry on pieces. People were bringing larger bags on than we had. It was outrageous!  Our flight was delayed by 2 hours and we did not even get an email update. The only thing that saved our trip was the kind flight attendant on the aircraft who was very nice and respectful!

795,was the worst flight,G Lester,VerifiedReview,"  I was due to travel from Cleveland to Manchester via Toronto. The Cleveland flight was delayed due to technical difficulties. This meant that I was unable to make my transfer in Toronto and would need to find alternatives. There were no Air Canada staff to be found, only harassed United Airlines who code carry with them. No one could give advice, answers or assurances. After 3 hours we were allowed onto the plane. It was a blisteringly hot day and we were sat in a full, tiny plane in the heat with no air con and no ventilation for 20 mins. People in the cabin were beginning to panic - the crew gave vague assurances that things would eventually get cooler. By this point, I too was beginning to panic, feeling distressed and unable to catch my breath. When the plane took off, it cooled down slightly. What followed was an hour of complete hell - the pilots announcements were inaudible. This was the worst flight I have experienced in 40 years of flying. The cabin was dirty, cramped, the young woman serving us was indifferent and I could not wait to get off. I was then transfer via Dublin on an Air Canada Rouge flight, (think Easyjet without the cherry staff) - arriving 8 hours later than planned and without any luggage (it still hasn't arrived) At no time during this process did I feel of any significance to Air Canada - no friendly advice, no offers of help. Upon arrival in Manchester I discovered that 3 other passengers on my flight had had the same experience, they too were looking for luggage that never arrived.

796,seats were hard and uncomfortable,M Morrison,VerifiedReview,"  I normally fly BA to Europe, but since their service has apparently gone sharply downhill as of this year (their catering has virtually disappeared and their reviews here on Skytrax are truly appalling), I thought I'd try Air Canada again. Flew from Toronto to London Heathrow / Geneva. The check-in/bag drop at Pearson was terrible. I arrived 2.5 hours before the flight and there was a long line that barely moved. It took an hour before I got to a desk. Typical case of lots of desks available but less than half were being used. Not acceptable for a full long-haul flight. The aircraft to London was a B777. I knew that AC had reconfigured these planes to squeeze 10 instead of the previous 9 seats per row. And I'd heard that the seats were hard and uncomfortable. And they are! Fortunately the seat next to me was free, but even so, it was pretty tight and I could not get comfortable all night. AC uses these aircraft on 16-hour flights to Asia and Australia, which must be unbearable. However, the IFE system is modern with an excellent selection of movies/entertainment, and good screen quality. The catering is standard and decent enough, certainly better than AC Rouge, BA or Air Transat these days. Lots of water runs throughout the flight, which were appreciated. My return flight was from Geneva on an older A330. Overall this was a good thing: the seats were wider and more comfortable, with proper cushioning and excellent leg-room. The IFE system was dated, though, and the selection not as good, but still adequate. The catering was again decent enough. All in all I would fly Air Canada again to Europe for direct flights. It seems to be one of few airlines to still offer a good, traditional service for a fair price.",19th June 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to London Heathrow / Geneva,Jun-17,3,4,4,4,2,0,4,80
797,staff were unapologetic,Ian Leonard,VerifiedReview," I flew London to Toronto in Air Canada business class (after upgrading from premium economy) which has to be the worst experience of flying I have had.

798,awful staff in Rome,C Lassara,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Rome. The Air Canada staff at the Toronto Airport were very friendly, professional and very competent. It was very easy to check in and get loaded on the aircraft. Unfortunately things started going downhill after that. The aircraft was freezing cold. They had the a/c on high for some unknown reason. Even after many people complained, one of the cabin crew claimed they turned up the temperature by a couple of degrees. It was still as cold. Everyone was glad to get off the plane in the morning and warm up.  Air Canada staff in Rome are rude, impatient, unfriendly and incompetent at best. They act like you are bothering them at the check in counter and after our flight home was cancelled, you cannot make up just how incompetently they mishandled the situation. I'm not talking about just 1 person. It was pretty much all of them. Their communication was awful as to getting our bags back. The passengers were basically left to fend for themselves to find their bags since we were all sent to the wrong turnstile. Then Air Canada sent someone with the voice of a mouse to give instructions on who goes to what hotel. This almost turned into a riot since almost no one could hear or understand. The employee seemed to have no idea what she was doing and gave terrible instructions as to which hotels and where to find the shuttle buses. There was no organization whatsoever from the Air Canada staff. It really was the incompetent leading the incapable. It took the airport police who were wonderful to get us to the hotel. Air Canada could care less. The next morning, we were right back to the rude, impatient treatment at the check in counter with a different person and disorganizion at the gate since we had to be bused to the plane. Everyone was thrilled to get away from the Air Canada Rome staff once they were on the plane. We must give credit to the cabin crew however for the return flight. Although this aircraft was almost as cold, the staff couldn't do enough for everyone. They were kind and professional. The wonderful Air Canada staff in Toronto guided us to Customs and we got all our bags. I would have scored Air Canada higher if not for their awful staff in Rome and the planes being kept so damn cold.",6th June 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Rome,Jun-17,4,3,3,4,1,0,4,80
799,had a great experience,P Lim,VerifiedReview,"  San Francisco to Toronto via Montreal. My husband had a great experience flying Air Canada for our first time. The staff from check-in, flight attendants and captain were all professional yet cordial, ensuring all customers were well treated and comfortable. We had a connecting flight between Montreal to Toronto, with a fairly tight window. The Director of the attendants, made a personal call to ensure the flight would wait for us before departing. Knowing we had to go through Customs prior to changing flights made us quite nervous we'd miss the connecting flight, but the Air Canada staff was quite supportive and helpful, making us feel much taken care of! Of course, they were right, we finished going through Canadian customs and reached the boarding area with 30 minutes to spare.To date this is our favorite airline, and we've been telling our friends and other Tauck Tour travelers how much we enjoy flying with Air Canada. We look forward to flying with Air Canada regularly! ",5th June 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Toronto via Montreal,May-17,4,5,5,5,5,0,5,80

801,The flight was alright,Krishnan Srinivas,VerifiedReview,"  This was an onwards Lufthansa codeshare flight from Frankfurt to Toronto in premium economy. The flight was alright. I had done a special order for an Asian Vegetarian Meal and I did not like the food. On an 8-hour flight, I thought they could have provided a second meal. Instead, they served one sandwich before landing. The in-flight entertainment system was not interesting for me. Overall, this was not a flight I expected, despite there being some value for money.",29th May 2017,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Toronto ,Sep-16,3,3,3,3,5,0,3,81
802,losing our baggage,G Lane,VerifiedReview,"  San Francisco to London via Toronto. Flights coming back: smooth, and well done. Flight going to London - it's been over two weeks since I first addressed everything that went wrong, including missing flights, being bumped to different flights, them losing our baggage, and their support team literally says an agent has up to 30 days for a response.  The flight that left on May 10th was late. About 45 minutes late out of SFO (San Francisco). This ended up making us late for the connection flight in Toronto. When we got to the gate we were informed that we had been removed from the connection flight because we hadn’t checked in. Of course we hadn’t checked in, because the original flight Air Canada had us on was late. So we tried to get back on the original flight. Luckily they got us on. However, they had already moved our bags to the following flight leaving out of Toronto. So they had to move our bags back. They said they would get a runner to do it. Fair enough. When we landed in LHR (London), they didn’t have our bags. We went to the baggage claim desk for Air Canada. They said they had no scans on our bags and had no idea where they were. They asked us to file a claim and track it through your World Tracer program. This trip was becoming a nightmare. Because the flight was delayed in Toronto the flight to LHR landed late. This made us miss our original flight to Munich that we had made on Lufthansa. We went to the Lufthansa desk who said it would be $271.00 for each of us to get a new flight. Still no update on the baggage tracer. Kept calling their baggage claim desk, and they said the bags hadn’t arrived on the recent flight coming in from Toronto. We ended up needing to book new flight with a completely different airline much later in the day. This time directly to Salzburg (our eventual location) coming out of LGW (Gatwick). Total price for the two flights: $293.40. As we were about to leave LHR to head to Gatwick, we got a call from baggage claim. They had our bags. Their World Tracer, which they kept pointing us to for more information which showed absolutely no updates, never showed the bags delivered. In fact, it STILL doesn't show the bags reached us and it's been over two weeks if you can believe it. So…where do we stand? They causes us to miss their own connection flight in Toronto. They caused us to miss our Lufthansa flight to Munich (and we had provided plenty of time from arrival in London to departure for the next flight). They screwed up delivery of our bags (they still haven't officially confirmed us receiving our bags, that's how TERRIBLE their bag tracer is). And yup. I contacted their support team. Nothing. Absolutely NOTHING has been done since we've gotten back from London. They just keep saying the same thing over and over again: a support agent is looking into your case and will respond within 30 days. I am never flying with them again. While some of their agents and staff do a great job, part of their team is absolutely incompetent, has zero sympathy for nightmares like this, and their support team is practically unreachable unless you plan to wait 45 minutes on the phone for one of them to answer, or you want to go through online channels, where they have up to 30 days to get back to you.

803,the sub-par product,M Coram,VerifiedReview,"  Brussels to Toronto via Montreal. Having sampled Premium economy on Air France on a trip to Paris last year and having had an excellent experience, I was truly disappointed at the sub-par product Air Canada offers in comparison to the return trip I just took to Brussels from Montreal. I flew on an A330. The seat comfort is mediocre with little space to manoeuvre and if the person in front of you decides to recline their chair, it's game over. Sleep was impossible because of malfunctioning closet door near the galley that kept opening in spite of the attendant's very noisy attempts to close it permanently. On the outbound I was served a veal stew which was ok though truthfully it could have been any meat thanks to the heavy sauce. Breakfast was literally a slice of grey bread wrapped in plastic which I declined. Out of Brussels, nothing is more infuriating than sitting in a half empty Premium economy cabin (AC833 27/5/17) after having been told that the flight was full (both economy cabins evidenced many empty seats after take-off) and being told before take-off that your food choice is no longer available thereby compromising the principle of not getting what you pay for. After complaining to the flight director who was charming but useless and mouthing platitudes that she would write it up in her report, I braced myself for the arrival of the pasta dish that no one else wanted and that I was going to be saddled with, unless I wanted to be hungry for the next seven hours. It arrives, the foil is removed and it is dry at the edges. I to eat the bun and lettuce with six small slices of red pepper. The dessert is artificially creamy with peach bits that has some pleasant taste but which hardly provides fulfilling sustainment. An hour before landing we are served a savoury pastry in a cardboard box. Mine is a Chicken Fajita.  I look at the writing on the box and it says it is made in the UK with ingredients as silicone dioxide to prevent anti-caking and colour - it also says this Fajita is made with chicken from Brazil.  I found out that if you try to use the business class toilets up front, you will be castigated and sent to the ones at the back of the aircraft.

804,Stranded at Pearson International,Eugene Borokhovski,VerifiedReview,"  Stranded at Pearson International (Toronto) because of our 5-hour delayed flight from San Antonio, we (at least 14 passengers with connections to Montreal and Ottawa) had a very unpleasant experience with Air Canada there. Its personnel at the connection desk offered us no apologies, no options for accomodation and no compensation, but instead lectured us with apparent agitation, even aggression, for being ungrateful daring to question their ""hospitality"". We spent the entire night on the floor of the airport where its administration ""generously"" provided prison-style blankets. Complaints to AC customer relations department resulted in an offer of 25% discount for the next flight off so-called ""base fair"", which (when applied), is still roughly 10-15% percent more expensive than what you could easily find on any consolidator website. Ruined plans, worries of friends and families, unattended business meetings, lost time, simply discomfort, both physical (from sleepless night) and moral (when you are just expected to gratefully overspend on overbooked flights and be happy and quiet about it) - all these things, apparently, are not considered, much less covered by the AC policy.",26th May 2017,Business,Economy Class,San Antonio to Montreal via Toronto,May-17,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,81

808,Overall horrible experience,S Gabruch,VerifiedReview,"  Was extremely disappointed with service. I had booked a flight months ago with Air Canada to leave New York LGA airport on may 7th at 5:50pm to Toronto with an hour and half lay over there before heading to Edmonton. We found out the flight was cancelled at 2pm that day due to construction at the Toronto Airport. It was ridiculous for them to find out that late that construction would be occurring at that terminal. But that's all fine, what I am upset about is the fact I had to take a flight to Montreal at 8:50pm and have a lay over there until 7:40 am. I was expecting hotel to be covered but unfortunately it was not technically their fault. They also neglected to tell us that technically the Air Canada ticket counter was closed until 4a.m. So we had to ""sleep"" in the outer lobby where any one could have access to steal our stuff. Needless to say we did not sleep at all and waited till 4am to come into the airport.

First out flight was delayed, then the gate was changed and eventually it was canceled. Over 200 people had to stay in the airport overnight, service of the airline was extremely bad and intentionally slow. Our flight was scheduled 11 hours later, 6 of those hours I've spent in the lines to get a food voucher, collect my baggage, register on the new flight, go through customs twice. There was no staff at the airport to help, and impossible to get any answers. On the new flight, which was over 5 hours long, there were no free meals or even snack. So starving people had to pay to get some food. Airline provided 20$ food voucher per person, that's how much money I had to feed myself for over 10 hours.

812,passed from desk to desk,H Jenkins,VerifiedReview,"  
Air Canada is easily able to provide one of the worst experiences to travellers of any airline. Their inability to manage delays and cancellations astounds me since it's such a regular thing for them. Yesterday most of their domestic flights from Toronto were cancelled due to a known outage of one runway, and most of their international flights were delayed. Despite knowing this it was chaos. I was incorrectly passed from desk to desk when I arrived late to a cancelled flight. Each person sent me to someone else or lied to me. Eventually I ended up outside of security with no luggage, no transport to my destination no luggage and no one who could give me any help or information. Every agent I dealt with lied to me to get me to go away and there was no joined up process for dealing with numeesous stranded passengers. The only helpful person was the woman at the delayed baggage call centre who had empathy, knowledge and genuinely helped me try to resolve my situation. Never again Air Canada!

813,entertainment system has a fundamental flaw,R Carter,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada from Vancouver to Montreal. Some minor delays, but nothing major. The aircraft is amazing if not for one thing: the entertainment system has a fundamental flaw. On screen controlls are nice, but also controls have been aded on the armrest. Consequently, any arm on top or near it sets off the screen, volume, light, calls the attendant and so on. The only solution was to not rest the arm period. Does not work.

814,Air Canada's horrible service,D Pan,VerifiedReview,"  Honolulu to Deer Lake via Vancouver. My family's wonderful Hawaii trip had a very upsetting ending due to Air Canada's horrible service. We endured multiple flight delays and cancellations due to technical issues with their planes and had to pay for three hotel rooms out of pocket to accommodate our 8-month old baby and my elderly parents who would have been stranded overnight in two separate cities. It took us 2+ days to get back home (instead of the scheduled 23 hours). Our returning flight AC1830 was delayed due to technical issues. We found out about the delay when we arrived at the airport around 7:00 pm (no previous warning) and the departure was initially postponed from 10:00 pm to 3:45 am but got delayed again to 4:15 am early in the morning. AC told us that since they didn't cancel the flight they were not responsible to book us a hotel room despite the fact that we had an infant and two seniors travelling with us. I couldn't understand how AC expected families with small children and babies to deal with this - sleep on the airport floor? We decided to book a hotel room on our own since we have 20+ hours flight ahead of us and an infant baby travelling with us. A motel room with airport shuttle cost us $200+tax USD/room due to the last minute booking. AC did postpone the departure again from 3:45 to 4:15 am. Neither my husband nor I was able to sleep well as we were afraid to miss our flight. This was only the beginning of our horrible experience. We were supposed to have two connecting flights after arriving in Vancouver (VAN-TOR, TOR-DL). Due to this first delay, AC had to cancel our subsequent flights and rebook the rest of our trip. Instead of flying to Deer Lake on the same night we arrived in Toronto, we had to stay in Toronto overnight. However, AC couldn't give us the rest of our boarding passes, nor could it book a hotel in Toronto for us. The agent in Honolulu told us that we needed to get the hotel from AC's customer service in Toronto once we got there. AC's flight from Vancouver to Toronto got delayed again and the plane did not land in Toronto airport until 10:45 pm on May 2nd. By the time we got off the plane it was almost 11:30pm. There were 50+ people in line at the AC customer service kiosk, while only two to three agents were working. The line hardly moved and after midnight an agent came to the line telling us all the hotels around the airport were sold out and we had to look for hotels on our own. He said the desk would be closing in 30 minutes and the agents would leave despite there were still so many of us unserved. He told us to call AC to rebook our flights. He also told us to find hotel on our own; and AC will reimburse up to $100 CAD per room. Seriously, I want to ask AC where to find a hotel room cost $100 or less nowadays?? As we learned that we wouldn't be helped by anyone at the desk, my husband started to call AC about our booking and I started looking for hotel rooms for us since we were all exhausted and I did not want my super-exhausted baby to sleep on the floor in the airport. As it was after midnight already, I couldn't book a room on Expedia or other online booking website as they couldn't take May 2nd as the check-in date. Therefore I started calling every hotel around the airport. Finally a hotel had two rooms available and they cost us $169+taxes although the regular online booking price is no more than $128, thanks to AC for causing the last min booking.",5th May 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Deer Lake via Vancouver,May-17,1,3,1,0,1,0,1,82
815,never flying with them again,A Mirkam,VerifiedReview,"  Air Canada was horrible, first they changed my flight schedule without even letting me know (they rebooked me on a flight from Havana to Frankfurt via Toronto to Amsterdam instead of Toronto straight to Amsterdam, without notifying me) and if I wouldn't have checked myself I would have missed these flights. And when I called about this they put me on another flight, with an excuse about the flight that was very vague and when I looked it up it turned out they told me a very different reason. When I arrived at Schiphol at the day of my departure I suddenly had to pay for my bag as it was not included in their system (while it was on my ticket), so I had to pay 95 euros for a service that I bought when I booked (On the Air Canada site). And when I wanted to check-in for the flight in Havana they couldn't put me on a seat, and I had to wait until 20 minutes before the flight before even knowing if I had a seat. While flying their in-flight system kept failing and turning on again, so I've watched the beginning from my movie for at least 4 times.. Air Canada is horrible, and even after 1.5 months I haven't heard from their refund services.

Then to further complicate things they made us wait on the Tarmac for an hour prior to take off, due to fog. My connecting flight to Montreal was cancelled, no reason given. Now I'm forced to spend the next 8 hours in Toronto airport with my cat, locked up in the handicap bathroom. The only place I can allow my cat out, so he has some freedom. My flight lands at my destination tomorrow morning at 8.30. A 7 hour flight, that took 27 hrs. And this time with a cat.

It's the only airline that has a direct flight Toronto to Indianapolis and never has it ever been on time (12+ flights) and is always late. Not just a few minutes but hours! The 8.50pm usually leaves at 10.30pm. Air Canada do us all a favor and at least be honest with your posted take off times so when new passengers pay your fees for a ticket they know it's not leaving till 10.30pm (and that's the earliest I've ever taken off for the 8.50 flight). ,29th April 2017,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Indianapolis,Apr-17,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,82

Two hours into the flight, an attendant gave me a message from the flight deck that passenger Gagnon had possibly left a purse and box of chocolates at the departure gate.

819,lucky to only lose one day of our vacation,R Roberts,VerifiedReview," We were flying Charlotte to London via Toronto with Air Canada. We realized that Toronto was limited by a closed runway and asked to be rerouted the night before but were assured that we would make our connecting flight. Despite our plane sitting outside of the gate in Charlotte we were delayed over two hours going to Toronto due to a lack of landing slots since Toronto was down to a single runway. Canadian flights have priority over US. Luckily, we were able to get four seats (not together) on the next morning's flight to London from Toronto but we had to spend a long, cold, uncomfortable night in the Toronto airport. Air Canada offered no accommodations for us due to this delay. The return flight was almost as bad. Our two hour layover in Toronto was barely enough time to get through security and customs and get out to the end of the terminal for our connecting flight home.  We were lucky to only lose one day of our vacation to this incompetent airline.

I have flown Premium Economy on Air Canada's Boeing 787 and found it to be better - separate toilets and I recall the seats were better, but that is very subjective.

The in-flight entertainment is good quality and there was an adequate range of new movies to keep passengers entertained during the flights! I especially appreciate that movies can be watched in various languages! The catering was just OK, the food quality is average. We were served a hot meal (with two choices) with a complimentary beverage. They serve water during the whole flight after meal services which is appreciated. This is much better service in comparison with competitors on this route e.g. Air Transat or even Air France.

824,showed complete indifference,Gregory Conti,VerifiedReview," I was supposed to fly Air Canada from London Heathrow to Columbus via Toronto. After arriving in Toronto, I learned that my connecting flight was cancelled. I was rebooked on a flight several hours later. This was then delayed, and I became worried that it would be cancelled. However, after repeated inquiries with the Air Canada gate agent, I was informed that it would be taking off that night, although hours late. Then at the last second this flight was cancelled, around 9 pm. No announcement was made of the cancellation until after it was supposed to have departed - the flight simply stopped being listed online or on the airport board. I entered a long customer service line, however, in the midst of waiting the agents went home from their shift. No clarity was provided about where we were supposed to go next. The customer service agents simply walked away. A long period of confusion in which it was simply impossible to find any Air Canada representatives. The amount of understaffing was appalling, and there appeared to be no urgency from anyone I spoke to about resolving the many issues that people were having. Finally, I wound up in a rebooking line, where I stood for over two hours before being helped. Despite repeated complaints from me and others to increase the level of staffing, this never happened: there were only two agents for dozens of customers. When I finally got to speak to someone, they made it clear that at the earliest I could fly to Columbus the following evening, because the earlier flights to Columbus were cancelled or fully-booked. The fact that I could not get out of Toronto until the following evening made my trip moot (it was only a two-day trip for a conference, one of which I would have completely missed). I therefore requested that I simply be booked a return ticket to London for the next morning and I gave up on my trip. After some haggling the agent reserved a place for me on a flight. However, although I was entitled by Air Canada policy to a hotel room for the night, none was provided for me. I spent the night on the floor of the Toronto airport. Despite pleading for some kind of compensation (I mentioned access to the airline lounge, so that I might change clothes / take a shower / have a minimum of comfort), I was given nothing but $20 of food vouchers. The next day my flight back to London was delayed almost two hours simply out of poor handling. In sum, Air Canada showed complete indifference to stranded travellers, made no effort to provide adequate staffing to deal with the problems that stranded travellers were facing; provided no lodging, were completely untransparent about the reasons for the delays and cancellations. To top it off, they are now being very difficult with regards to a refund. I was told that I had to go through Expedia, because that was where I made my booking. Now Expedia has sent me back to Air Canada. Air Canada claims that it may take 25 days to process my request. This should be the simplest matter in the world, there is no gray area: my trip was cancelled, I never made it to my destination, and I was left stranded at the airport without lodging in violation of their own policy. I just want my money back. ",8th April 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Columbus via Toronto,Apr-17,2,3,2,2,1,0,1,83
825,"less legroom, very limited IFE",C Davidson,VerifiedReview,"  Victoria-Toronto-Ottawa 15 March, returning 21 March. Reservation made through AC website and seat selection purchased at that time. In both directions, YYJ-YYZ legs served by A321s, YYZ-YOW legs by A320s. Seats and legroom comfortable although there was a 5 cm gap between the fuselage and window-seat armrests, reducing seat width unnecessarily. FAs made frequent runs to offer water. Three main glitches, all to be taken in stride as part of air travel nowadays: (i) Outbound from YYJ, the video safety presentation could not be played aloud through the cabin's PA system (though it was on the video screen), so FAs had to demonstrate the safety features themselves. (ii) The onward outbound YYZ-YOW leg was delayed nearly an hour, with all passengers remaining seated, while a possible technical fault in the cockpit controls was investigated. (iii) Accumulation of incoming flights at YOW meant that YOW baggage system was backed up and dispensing of baggage was delayed till an hour after aircraft had arrived. Oddly, on the five-hour return leg YYZ to YYJ, when I purchased a gin-and-tonic the miniature bottle was labelled ""Duty free"" and ""Export strength"" (47.3 percent alcohol). If Air Canada can use duty-free alcohol to serve on domestic flights, their price of CAD 6.50 per drink is pretty steep. This summer, Air Canada plan to downgrade all their non-stop YYJ-YYZ flights to their ""Rouge"" service level (less legroom, very limited IFE).",2nd April 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Victoria to Ottawa via Toronto,Mar-17,4,4,0,2,4,0,4,83
826,a pleasant experience,Mitchell MacLeod,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto - Edmonton aboard mainline Air Canada was a pleasant experience after the so-so watered down Business Class one on Rouge MCO-YYZ. What really was outstanding was the FA up front with whom I have flown with before. Other than that standard Air Canada Business experience, unmemorable food, a comfortable seat and good quality alcohol. I did appreciate my bags actually being first off the carousel which happens too infrequently as I had exactly three minutes to catch a ETS bus into town, or wait an hour, or face a $65 cab ride. The choice of audio on the seat back monitor left a lot to be desired, never heard of many of the artists, don't think you can go wrong with classic rock or pop, but there were few selections of such available, so I listened to my own tunes.",1st April 2017,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Toronto to Edmonton,Mar-17,4,5,4,3,5,0,4,83
827,Business Class does not measure up,T Foran,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Munich with Air Canada. There is good news and bad news here. The food was better than any Air Canada Business Class meal I have had before. The staff were enthusiastic and attentive. The onboard entertainment selection was very weak, with a few new movies and even fewer classic movies. The music choice was appallingly short. I was not given noise cancelling headphones and was left with the awful headphones that AC gives out for free to economy class. The lie flat bed has very hard and I could not sleep.I expressly book business class so that I may get good sleep. The agent in Toronto did not mention to me that I needed to obtain my luggage in Munich and take it to my connecting flight. So, I had no luggage for the first two days of my trip. Business class is so costly that every individual detail is vital and can not be overlooked. So, despite the better meals, Air Canada Does not measure up when it comes to their Business Class product to the level of even the good European carriers.

828,best experience to the Caribbean,G Dorlano,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Aruba in economy class  on an A320. Booked the flight with points. Boarding was delayed due to an air traffic control ground delay program. Something to do with the space launch over Florida. We left the gate around 45 minutes late but were able to catch up time enroute. The service was nice and standard for North American flights. Drinks and buy onboard served efficiently, though one of the flight attendants was not very polite or attentive. The entertainment is far better then any other airline flying to the Caribbean. Seats where very comfortable and had a lot of space. Sat in seat 17b With my girlfriend next to me in 17a. Wifi worked great while flying in US airspace.

829,flight seats had been oversold,K Murtle,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to Vancouver. We arrived at the airport with lots of time to spare prior to our flight. One of the check in ladies helped us get our bags sorted and accepted. We paid to check our bags in for Vancouver on that flight checking in a small suitcase and a larger one. She printed us boarding passes and bag tags and explained that our seat allocations would be made at the gate. We arrived at the gate with lots of time to spare and waited. The staff there announced that they thought there was insufficient space on the plane to take all of the passengers carry on luggage and started to request that passengers voluntarily check their carry on luggage in. They also started to circulate around the passengers and tried to ‘talk’ anyone with largish carry on bags or multiple luggage items to check them in. They then announced that the flight seats had been oversold and that they wanted ‘volunteers’ to take a later flight. Then we were told that they would call out names for final seat allocations. I heard a name that started with the same letter as ours and approached the counter to personally enquire if it was in fact for our seat allocation. The Air Canada staff were all looking distressed and under pressure at this stage. I was told that it wasn’t my name but the lady took our ‘boarding passes’ and said that our tickets were only standby tickets. I noticed that the copy which she kept, with no seat allocation printed on it actually had ‘sb’ in very small letters where the seat number would normally be printed which meant nothing to me up until that very moment. She said she would check and call out my name in due course with seat allocations. After another 10 or 15 minutes and a number of other customers being issued boarding passes, she called my name and started speaking. I explained I was an international traveller and had to get back to Vancouver on that flight. I told her I had bought and paid for my tickets weeks earlier and as far as I was concerned, I was contractually entitled to travel on that flight. We did get onto the flight, probably because I had been so insistent. When we arrived at Vancouver, after the 5 hour flight plus a lengthy wait at the carousel, our smaller case finally came onto the conveyor. I checked with the lost baggage staff, again having to wait for some time in a queue. They were good and advised that my other bag had been routed on a flight to Toronto and would arrive later that night. They would then deliver it to my Vancouver address the next morning. It arrived at about 1430 hours the next day and it looked as though it had been dragged through muddy water. It was filthy. And the luggage tag on it was tagged ‘standby’ as well. I will get the case cleaned now that we are home. ",29th March 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Vancouver,Dec-16,3,2,0,0,1,0,1,83
830,flying experience was average,R Morrison,VerifiedReview,"  London to Pearson by Air Canada: Boarding had started on-time, I stepped on-board and was not greeted by any crew member. I walked to my seat which was 30G. I sat down and right away noticed that the seat was quite narrow, however my table was in my arm rest, so that gave me even less space then everyone else. We were then delayed because of 'engine problems.' We then departed about 20 mins late. About an hour after we took off they served us our lunch which was quite good and I have to say I did enjoy it. For the rest of the flight I listened to music on my phone, and watched some interesting TV-shows. Then as the flight came to an end we were served a sausage wrap, which was spicy but also enjoyable. We arrived in Toronto 10 mins early and I have to say that the overall flying experience was average.",27th March 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Toronto Pearson ,Mar-17,1,2,4,4,3,0,3,84

Offered to check my carry on at no charge as flights were full and the size of carry on's that they allow on board is ridiculous so I did. Flight from Toronto to Ottawa was delayed about 45 minutes due to late arrival of aircraft. Hung out in the Maple leaf Lounge. Food hasn't improved, still just salads and Mac and cheese. Upon arrival in Ottawa the carry on that they checked for free didn't arrive, I have a Tile device attached and could see that it was still in Toronto so with the wait at the missing bag desk added about an hour to process.

I was recently advised that the date of my flight changed from April 3rd to April 4th. I called the Air Canada offices and wasn't provided with any viable alternatives (leave a day earlier to arrive two days later or refund my ticket).

We were so disappointed to see that the experience for the travellers is the least of Air Canada's concerns. No TV, no food for a 6 hour flight seems unreasonable. The time allowed to transfer from one flight to another is far too short and we got no assistance whatsoever even though we were travelling with kids. Overall very poor.

837,disappointed in Air Canada,Josh Banman,VerifiedReview,"  Puerto Vallarta to Kelowna via Vancouver. Flight to Puerto Vallarta was good, staff awesome and service was prompt. Unfortunately on the way home I can't say the same. We checked in early and selected our seats to ensure a window and isle seat and to avoid the long lines at the airport waiting for check in. Once we arrived at the airport we waited 3rd in line for over an hour watching everyone who was checking in at the airport go through infront of us due to a computer issue. Then we were told that the flight was full and we had to sit in the middle despite checking in 24 hours before. Once in the plane the AC unit went down and we sat on the runway inside the boiling hot plan for an hour while crews scrambled to fix the issue. So we take off and I'm excited to get water after waiting in a hot plane for an hour only to wait 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight to even speak to a flight attendant. When I asked why things were so slow they scoffed at me and blamed the airline for cutting down from 7-6 flight attendants for this flight. Now I understand this can be stressful for them and create more work, but where I'm confused is how come on the way down with 6 flight attendants I received awesome service and water and coffee several times? I wish it could stop there but unfortunately it doesn't, we had to catch a connecting flight wich was overbooked, and we were asked if anyone would like to stay behind in Vancouver, only to find out it was so two Air Canada employees could fly home. Once our connecting flight to Kelowna landed at 12am our little plane of 30 had to sit on the runway for an hour while the other 2 international planes of over 150 passengers unloaded. Super disappointed in Air Canada and will definitely choose WestJet when flying next time.

838,very enjoyable 8 hr flight,Tracey Roberts,VerifiedReview,  London Heathrow to Calgary. I had a very enjoyable 8 hr flight with Air Canada in economy! Service was excellent. Flight attendants went out of their way to make sure you had plenty of refreshments and plenty of water. In flight entertainment was 1st class showing all the latest films. Seats were comfortable. No delays. I was served a hot meal with drinks of my choice not long after take off and also a hot snack about an hour before landing. Two weeks later on 18th December I flew back to the UK with Air Canada and again excellent service. Only criticism it is a shame they do not offer different films flying east to west/west to east as some other airlines do.

839,seats were so narrow,K Mitchell,VerifiedReview," London Heathrow to Newark via Toronto with Air Canada. I chose this airline as I am a Star Alliance Gold member but this was clearly a big mistake. This is the first time I have seen ten seats per row in economy on a B777 and I have flown many airlines. The seats were so narrow the it reminded me of a very low budget airline. Seven hours on a seat like this and you come out with leg and back pain. I had to keep my hands stack on my body as there was no space to rest them. Do not bother paying for the extra legroom seats as these are even more narrow due to the entertainment monitor stored in the armrest. Flight attendants completely uninterested and rude. No response to seat calls. Priority delivery of luggage for gold members not respected at Newark - our luggage came out among the last. Out of the four flights, three were late by an hour without any explanation of apology. Meals during flights small and of average quality.

Due to weather conditions, my flight from Toronto to Halifax was cancelled. But the ground staff didn't do anything to solve that problem. Instead they send me to another airline, which was more helpful than Air Canada themselves. Air Canada wanted me to stay for unknown number of days at Toronto airport and did not bother paying for an accomodation. Their hotline in Germany can also only be reached from 09:00am to 5:30 pm.

841,speak the language of your choice,B Rayner,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to St Louis via Toronto. I am trilingual Canadian frequent flyer 35K with Air Canada (I speak English 1st language, French 2nd language and Spanish 3rd language). I am always courteous, respectful of other cultures and speak the language of the person with whom I am doing business if I can. Air Canada is Canada's national airline (and I believe was even built with some public funding) and is expected to be bilingual English and French. When I travel to Montreal Quebec, quite often the attendants do not show this same courtesy of speaking English to me even when I clearly state this preference as a client. When I fly to other Canadian (outside of Quebec) or American cities they speak the language of your choice. I have flown many airlines over the past few years from many differant countries and more and more I am disappointed by Air Canada for the reasons described above, not to mention pricing and services offered. This lack of simple respect for my culture and language (English) is causing me to reconsider the choice of airline in the near future.",13th February 2017,Business,Economy Class,Montreal to St Louis via Toronto,Feb-17,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,85
842,attendants were friendly,D Hunt,VerifiedReview," Calgary to London Heathrow with Air Canada. This was a good flight that left on time and arrived on time. I took seat 12A in Premium Economy, which felt great compared to coach (which I have typically flown). You get a business class style entrée with a printed menu and choice of entree, and the seats are quite noticeably wider and with more recline. The attendants were friendly and made the rounds regularly without being intrusive. I am definitely a bit of a clean and neat freak, but the plane interior, including the bathroom, was organised and spotless. Upon boarding, we were given a departure drink (I chose OJ). After takeoff, dinner was served with wine. The entertainment system was, as usual with AC, stocked with selections of some recent films. All in all, the flight was smooth and enjoyable. AC gets a lot of complaints that I have never found to be substantiated. I've flown them lots; I've never had a late flight and never had a staff member treat me rudely. They have an international fleet of new or new-ish equipment including many 787s and a really good safety record.",10th February 2017,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Calgary to London Heathrow,Jan-17,5,5,5,5,5,0,4,85

I explained that every plane ticket I have had prints it the same way. She said no and finally went to another agent to ask. The other agent looked at the ticket and my passport and said ""yes it is fine"" as I watched.

844,doubt I'll fly Air Canada again,M Lawson,VerifiedReview," I have travelled extensively over the years with many different airlines and, unfortunately, I have to say, I found on my recent flights Sydney to Vancouver return, the service on Air Canada is amongst the slackest I have experienced. On the way back from Vancouver, I had a head cold and needed regular drinks. I buzzed several times for tea / water etc but only once was my request answered. For the rest of the 16 hour journey, I buzzed but to no avail. Each time I needed a drink, or food, I had to get up from my seat, crawl over my fellow passengers, walk to the end of the aircraft to get my own refreshment. The worst part was, the entire crew was having a lovely time sitting down at the back, chatting away to each ignoring passenger requests. When I asked if they had noticed my bell call, they said they didn't hear it. However, when they looked, there were 3 others needing assistance listed on the screen. I wouldn't have heard the bell either if I was in the middle of a conversation. In addition to the lack of service, I feel that there could have been more food offered (it was minimal on such a long flight) and at no stage did the drinks trolley go around. Up to each passenger to request a drink. I guess it's a money saving ploy. The inflight entertainment was limited to a dozen movies that have been out for some time and didn't cater to a range of tastes. On 2 x 16 hour flights, this meant the choice was very limiting so I resorted to reading my book. Also, no wifi. Now that Air Canada has some competition from Sydney to Vancouver, it may be worth the crew lifting their game to remain competitive. On a positive note, the flight crew did a marvellous job getting us from A to B on both flights. Just a pity the cabin crew let the airline down. I doubt I'll fly Air Canada again.",9th February 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Vancouver,Feb-17,2,1,1,1,3,0,3,85

I was on the phone approximately 2.5 hours (on hold) until 1:30am at which time I had to hang up to go to bed. The next day I received an e-mail that we had been rebooked for the following day, meaning we would need to spend another night in Victoria. I called and spoke to a very rude representative and asked what am I supposed to do now with my 5 kids and their grandma and she replied that you need to book yourself a hotel room and that was it. The statement was, since weather is not in our control we're not obligated to pay hotel, food, transfers. Furthermore, only half the flights flying the same route to Vancouver were cancelled that day, all within an hour of each other. That one night cost me an extra $400 I didn't plan on spending. I am disgusted with Air Canada.

I have flown both main Canadian airlines (AC and WJ) lots and without really caring one way or the other, and have felt that Air Canada consistently offers high quality flights and flight service. On this recent flight I was in Premium Economy on a Boeing 787-8. Leg room and seat width in this cabin is substantially better than in coach, and you get the business class meal (china, glassware, and chilled silverware) with a printed menu and choice of main course. The meal itself is noticeably larger than in coach (if you are in coach, remember that you can ask for an extra meal and they are almost always able to give you one - I've done this on multiple occasions). Being an inter-continental flight, you also get complimentary alcoholic beverages in ALL classes. This flight (as well as AC850 from YYC to London) arrived early. The attendants were attentive and friendly, and airplane was clean, and the service was excellent.

Seats compare to other air lines (LH, KLM, Delta) are very small and uncomfortable. The food that was served was one of the lousiest. The cabin staff seem trained not to greet the passenger and not smile while serving. Food served first, drinks served 30 mins after the food. Stupid way to serve for a such a long flight, the aircraft was not equipped with WiFi. Washrooms were unhygienic and after first 5 - 6 hours, no staff was keeping the washrooms clean.

Upon arrival at the departure gate in Munich I was told my documents were invalid even though they were approved on the Canadian website. My luggage had not been loaded. It was intended I would not fly as the plane was overbooked. I was immediately put up in a Holiday Inn Express and rerouted through Frankfurt, Montreal to Winnipeg 24 hours later. This would not have been done if my paperwork was incorrect - and this same rejected paperwork saw me through to Canada. The ground staff were arrogant and dismissive.

After 5 business days I sent another email. Then I called Air Canada and was told that the other agent was wrong and it would be 10 business days. 10 business days came, no response. I called back today on the 15th business day and was told it was two weeks, so ""technically they're only one day overdue"". The agent today was most arrogant, unhelpful and useless.

Another attendant said I could not take that chair as it was broken and out of service. The first attendant rebooted the entertainment system and though I could not use the hand set, I was able to use the touch screen. I like to listed to classical music but there was no Mozart, no classical. A drink was served on my tray which collapsed. Now I am soaked with a double scotch. I have an extra shirt in my carry on and go to Business class bathroom where the sink was broken and wrapped in wide, colored adhesive tape. But its fine, when things go wrong, the flight attendant gives you a plastic Maple leaf pin right from his lapel. And documents the whole thing and submits it while we are in the air. I really did appreciate that. A month later I received an the email which was a voucher to use when you book a flight with us.

855,great service onboard,P Taplow,VerifiedReview," Chicago to Toronto with Air Canada. Great service onboard this comfortable flight. Flight attendants and ground staff were very polite. Inflight entertainment has lots of selection and works very well. Only negative was that no food is served on the this flight unless you pay but I knew about it before I booked the flight, it was a worth the deal.

856,worst customer service experienced,B Stuart,VerifiedReview," Booked from Brisbane to Calgary via Vancouver with Air Canada in Premium Economy. Got off loaded in Brisbane because of a late Virgin Australia connection (on same ticket) that got in 50 min before departure. No one even tried to let us make the connection. Was downgraded to Economy from Premium Economy the next day even though Business seats were available. Could not upgrade to Business Class with money because had no aero club membership. No one in the call centre could do the upgrade because there was no manager, which seems to be the title for the only staff who can make decisions. Told that we were lucky to be on the flight at all. They forgot to rebook our son on the next leg to Calgary and so had to take a later flight with 5 hour layup instead of 1.5 hours. Paid for Maple Leaf club and were told in Vancouver this only applied to 1 flight being the return flight where is a 1.5 hour change and could not tansfer to another leg. Dont fly Air Canada - worst customer service experienced in well over 400 flights.",16th January 2017,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,BNE to YYC via YVR,Jan-17,2,1,1,2,1,0,2,86
857,would describe my experience as mediocre,R Peters,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Dallas Fort Worth on January 14, 2017, in Economy. I would describe my experience as mediocre, a C in terms of classroom grades. The plane left Toronto about 45 minutes late, since the plane arrived with a delay from Montreal. There was no apology from Air Canada. The plane was completely full. There was, however, sufficient room in the overhead lockers, as ground staff had warned people to check large pieces (free of charge at the gate, at check-in, my suitcase was 35 CAD). Seating is very tight on the Embraer 175, when the person in front of me reclined his seat, there were about 10 inches from my head to the top of his seat. Thus, the three-hour flight was pretty uncomfortable. Likewise, when I used the bathroom at the back of the plane, I found that I could not fully stand up (I am 6'1""). For service, the cabin crew came through once with soft drinks; everything else had to be purchased. At the end of the flight, I asked one of the cabin attendants where our luggage would be arriving: ""On the carousel,"" she said - not very helpful, as there are about ten of those at terminal E. So, again, this was the average type of flight in the contemporary world of air travel. In my opinion, the Embraer 175 is too small a plane for the distance flown.",16th January 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to DFW,Jan-17,1,2,1,1,2,0,2,86
858,my luggage was left at Brisbane Airport,Gabrielle Wang,VerifiedReview,"  Brisbane to Vancouver. I flew Air Canada Business Class flight AC36 from Brisbane to Edmonton via Vancouver to visit my in-laws as I do every year during Christmas. I am impressed with their new aircraft. The business class seats were comfortable, food was not spectacular however I was happy with it. There was only one washroom dedicated for business class, it was very small and not clean. There were two other washrooms that were shared with premium economy class. Overall, I was not very impressed with the washrooms arrangements. The cabin crew were helpful but not the best. The overall inflight experience was a positive one. Despite the food being so-so, and I was not impressed with the washrooms, I had a restful and comfortable flight. My experience went downhill when I couldn't find my luggage at the airport. Later that day, Air Canada confirmed that my luggage was left at Brisbane Airport. I was waiting on the phone for one solid hour until I reached an operator who told me the best they can do is $50 per day compensation before the luggage arrive. I tried to explain to her that with the freezing cold winter in Edmonton, I could not possibly buy anything warm enough with $50. However, she could not do anything else and Air Canada does not have a customer service phone line. My luggage arrived 2 days later at my in-laws house. By then, I was in Orlando for a 6 days trip in which I had to purchase 6 days worth of essential items in Orlando. Anyhow, I eventually got my luggage when I returned to Edmonton, however, I never received the compensation Air Canada promised. I tried to reach them with their phone line only to be told that I had to write them a ""letter"". I called Brisbane Airport and was given the manager's number. I called the manager and was told that this was a secure number and that the airport should have never given this number to me and hung up. I have sent Air Canada an email and a Facebook message. I am yet to hear anything from them. I am very disappointed that all these years I had been a loyal customer to Air Canada and this is how I am treated.

859,seat configuration is simply awful,T Eldem,VerifiedReview, Munich to Toronto with Air Canada. We were met by the AC Concierge and promptly processed through the check-in formalities. The flight was delayed by a full hour due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. On board the high density configuration in Economy (3x4x3) on the B777 is simply awful. I had the bulkhead aisle seat and my knee and elbow were bumped several times and my foot stepped on twice. I cannot imagine anyone getting any sleep in that seat during an overnight flight. The configuration makes the aisles so narrow that one has to walk sideways so as not to bump into other passengers. This is a sad reminder that AC puts profits way ahead of passenger comfort. The FA's were all very nice and worked hard throughout the flight. The in flight service director on the other hand was smug and very condescending. Food was OK for Economy but portions were very small. IFE was descent but music selection remains obscure. Flight arrived late and was otherwise uneventful.,10th January 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MUC to YYZ,Jan-17,1,4,3,3,5,0,3,86
860,new Business Class certainly an improvement,Harry Aronowicz,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada from Munich to Toronto. Our group travelling together January 3 ranged in age of over 60 to 3 children aged 11 months, 2 and 4 years. All of the flight crew were not only professional but extremely pleasant and caring. Food presentation excellent, entertainment program good and seat comfort fine. Even though pod system the layout does allow for communication amongst passengers - the prior claustrophobic feeling has been eliminated. Pilot ""connected"" in a very nice way with our grandchildren and all of us too. New Business Class certainly an improvement. Check in process civilised. Only minus is Munich Airport which has long walks and different floor levels to conquer till aircraft position can be reached. Excellent experience and personally I was relieved to be able to state that the whole flight went smooth and enjoyable for all of us - including very young passengers. On a side note - the outbound flight on the 23rd of December was good too.",4th January 2017,Family Leisure,Business Class,MUC to YYZ,Jan-17,5,5,5,5,5,0,4,87
861,expected what we paid for,L Fletcher,VerifiedReview,"  Vancouver to Sydney. So disappointed. We paid extra money for more legroom and, whilst understanding the reality of cramped spaces on any airline, expected what we paid for. We have done this on several occasions with Virgin and found the seating and surrounding area to be more than satisfactory. Instead the area in front was constantly used by passengers to access toilets on the other side of the plane and for a toddler (parents seated three rows behind) to run backwards and forwards. The space to the right of us over the wing was used by passengers to stretch and chat the entire overnight flight. The stewards/ stewardesses were nowhere in sight and surfaced only at meal time. The passenger seated beside my husband was a very large man who required an extension belt, no problem and not judging him, but it made for a very uncomfortable flight. Being a large man, he occupied some of my husband's seat as well as his own. When it was obvious (before take-off) the flight was going to be difficult due to this factor, the stewardess responded that she could understand it would be uncomfortable but the flight was full and there was nothing she could do. We contacted Air Canada upon our return to request a refund of the additional money outlaid and were told that they offer a high standard of service and apologised that we disagreed - basically 'bad-luck'!

862,what a terrible shame,M Norton,VerifiedReview,"  What has happened to our beautiful Airline? We always flew Air Canada for the service and the people but now I fly further to avoid Air Canada. On Dec 31 2016, AC873, FRA-YYZ, either the FA who worked the rear business class section was getting ready for retirement or she was having a really bad day because her unfriendly, take it or leave it, monosyllabic attitude was quite pronounced. The new business class seat on the 777-300 is actually not so bad. The screen's a bit close but it's big and the seat depth is a bit short (I could never get the foot rest up to a comfortable height) but there's lots of space and charging stations and places for things. Very mediocre wine selection, I think one choice of either old or new world in red or white and as I said very mediocre. I hear they have espresso's and cappuccino's but they were not offered. I ordered the vegetarian meal which came out vegan and really it's mind boggling what the kitchen at AC thinks vegetarians eat. Years ago I had an amazing veg meal on a flight from Toronto to Calgary, roasted veg with baked tofu, really well done but this was some tasteless roasted eggplant on Polenta with a tablespoon of tomato sauce and that's pretty much what AC serve these days. All of this would have been overlooked if the FA had shown any kind of welcome or pleasant attitude. It was bare minimum, no more and definitely no service with a smile. AC 610, YYZ-YHZ started out well and I slept through most of it until the last 15 minutes of landing approach, when a little boy two rows behind us in business class, started to piercingly scream for his mother and was unconsolable screaming ""Momee"" until we landed. I thought maybe mommy was meeting the plane but it turned out that ""Momee!"" was the FA in-charge. To her credit, she remained the FA in-charge and didn't get up but probably not a good idea to fly with the family. I was a loyal AC flyer for decades but now Lufthansa and United I like better and I fly them 90% of the time. The timing on this route was deciding factor in flying with AC this time but that will not happen again. LH FA's are always welcoming and friendly and cannot do enough to make you comfortable up front. Other airlines amenity kits are becoming collectables but not so the hideous herringbone, sparse offering on AC. LH, Eva and Thai's Rimova amenity kits are a reason to fly them and not available anywhere else. I think AC have forgotten that many of us love to fly and it's about a happy experience. They are making money again and lots of it but at the expense of the customer service experience. What a terrible shame.",1st January 2017,Solo Leisure,Business Class,FRA to YHZ via YYZ,Dec-16,3,1,1,3,3,3,2,87
863,use phone but no headphones,Chris Fox,VerifiedReview,"  Air Canada - I thought they were a full service airline. Paid over AUD$500 for two of us to fly from Quebec a short hop to Toronto. This doesn't include checked baggage however (an extra $60) nor assigning a seat (that's an extra online fee as well). On arrival at the airport we realised the flight was full and when checking in on the kiosks we had been assigned separate seats on the aircraft despite being on the same booking. Fortunately a passenger next to me agreed to swap. The checkin agent was helpful only in explaining the reasons why we had been seated separately (a full aircraft, people on standby - not sure how any of this was relevant to not seat 2 people on the same booking next to each other). Now what Air Canada would likely say is that if we wanted seats we should have paid the online fee and seat assigned ourselves. It's a pity they have this type of model when they really are the only airline flying between many of these places in Canada. On a positive note, we did arrive and depart pretty close to schedule considering a big snowstorm had just been through the area. However I had to laugh when we arrived in a Toronto and the flight attendant made a PA asking all on board if we could let those with tight connections off the aircraft first, this was while we were waiting 10 minutes short of the bay for a marshaller to come and guide the aircraft onto the bay. I'd avoid Air Canada again except in a case such as this when they were the only nonstop option. On another note as well Air Canada have a policy that no headphones can be used on landing. But, portable electronic devices are permitted. So, you can use the phone but no headphones. When I enquired as to the reason behind this, Air Canada advised that this was for two reasons. Firstly, so they can ensure that you don't miss any PA announcements. And secondly, they can cause a hazard if you trip over the, during an evacuation. I have travelled a lot on many different airlines and this is the first I have heard of such an absurd policy.",31st December 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YQB to YYZ,Dec-16,3,3,0,0,2,0,3,87

When purchasing a code share flight United cannot provide seat assignments however a call to Air Canada with the flight confirmation info from United did let me get advance seat assignments. Ground crew and flight crews were professional and pleasant and both flights boarded and left on time. The CRJ's were cramped and not particularly clean and one of the planes had used tissues stuffed into the magazine pocket. Montreal proved to be very nice airport, especially after Newark but having to go through security for the third time that day was annoying.",30th December 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,EWR to YFC via YUL,Dec-16,2,4,3,0,4,0,3,87
865,it lacked in service,Sid Grover,VerifiedReview,"  Delhi to Toronto. Although Air Canada had a newer plane, the Boeing 787, it lacked in service. Executive pod seats are very comfortable. Fully flat bad recline. Lots of place to store things like phone, wallet. Food tasted fresh and had decent flavours. One of the washrooms wasn't working - the one in the front right by the cockpit. This is not a big deal for a 7 hr flight but a 15 hrs flight it is. As a result we had access to two washrooms behind the cabin - still not bad. Air Canada did a horrible job in terms of controlling who can access which washroom. Folks from premium economy and economy were using the business washrooms. I mean I paid extra for a reason. Every time I had to visit the washroom - there was a line up.  My wife was sleeping and didn't hear the announcement that the front washroom is not working - when she went to the front, one of the staff members rudely said, ""we told you it's not working"" My wife apologized and came back. Service - Before take off the staff brought drinks like champagne and orange juice, and my wife asked for a ginger ale. Staff initially brought sprite by mistake and then forgot about it. When my wife asked for ginger ale again she was told we cannot serve on ground. Initially we were not given the menu. When I complained they brought it. And then they took away my wife's food menu by mistake. Every time she asked for a menu - staff did a horrible job explaining what's available instead of giving a menu. In the morning she asked for omelette and was still given crepes. Everyone else was given 3 choices for breakfast. But some like myself were given 2. This is how inconsistent the service was. They definitely need to train their staff better.",29th December 2016,Couple Leisure,Business Class,DEL to YYZ,Dec-16,5,1,3,3,5,0,2,87
866,left his phone in the gate area,S Roper,VerifiedReview,"  Denver to Toronto. My husband left his phone charging in the gate area at Denver International Airport. Upon realizing it, he alerted the flight attendant. She told us the door was closed so it was naturally too late. However, she called the gate crew and the phone was found, and we were told the phone would be sent to us -simply talk to ground staff in Toronto. After doing that and calling Air Canada 10+ times now, I can't find anybody that knows what has happened or what will happen with the phone. Lost and found should be a very easy procedural thing. Don't know why it vexes Air Canada so much. ",27th December 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DEN to YYZ,Dec-16,1,1,3,3,1,0,1,87
867,they lied to people,C Graham,Not Verified,"In all my years of flying, the only upsetting flying instances I have had have been with Air Canada. I understand many variables are out of their control, but the lack of care I have seen and heard about them showing to their customers is disappointing. Tonight is one of those occasions when my flight from Halifax to Montreal for 6.10 was delayed to 6.50. That's no problem, and they told us multiple times during this 40 minute delay that our flight was in the air and on the way. 10 minutes before we are supposed to take off, they announce that the plane still hasn't left because of the poor visibility in Montreal and that it would be delayed for much longer. I understand that the plane can't take off, but everyone has been left upset because they lied to people saying the flight was on the way when it would appear they had no idea where it actually was. Since this incident the flight has been delayed twice more without notice from the staff, the time at the gate has simply changed to show a half hour later departure. We've now been waiting for 4 hours, and can't get any information on what the situation holds because the staff have left the gate. It is clear that they will say whatever it takes to get their customers to shut up, and I will be avoiding this airline wherever possible in the future.",27th December 2016,Solo Leisure,Business Class,YHZ to YUL,Dec-16,3,3,0,0,1,0,1,87
868,left stranded at an empty airport,C Huang,VerifiedReview," Air Canada flight originated from Toronto was supposed to be take off at 6:55pm, Dec 18, 2016. The flight did not take off over an hour later with no clear known reason. The flight was sitting on runway more than an hour. Finally took off 90 mins late caused me missed my connection from San Francisco to Ontario, California. Arrived at San Francisco 10:30pm, my connection flight has already gone. There was no one there to redirect or assist. My wife and I were left stranded at an empty airport with no food or sheet to cover. No direction of when the next flight what so ever. Contacted Air Canada customer service and no one to assist, except useless automated phone directory, which get me no answer to my needs. I truly do not believe how an airline could provide such a poor service and left passenger in a strange place without any service. I will not be travelling with Air Canada anymore and I would never recommend this airline to others.

869,left us stranded at the airport,Richard Ferris,VerifiedReview,"  Recently, my wife and I were flying from Rochester to Cairo by way of Toronto and London Heathrow. My wife and I were originally told at the gate in Toronto that the flight from Toronto to London was delayed 15 minutes, then it became 30 minutes. Then we were told that a new plane had to be brought in because of a mechanical issue and it would be about a 1.5 hour delay. We explained our concern to the agent at the gate, because we only had a 2 hour layover in Heathrow and were worried about missing our connecting flight to Cairo. She said that the plane would ""make up time in the air"". Ultimately, we actually left more than 2 hours later than scheduled because the new plane was also late. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Cairo. There are several exacerbating factors than just a delay. When we got on the plane, I told the flight attendant that we were going to be rushed to get to our connecting flight and asked if we could be let out first. Her response was ""We'll see"". When we landed, we were not given any accommodation whatsoever. We didn't land until approximately 10:15 p.m. The flight crew said that ""if"" we missed our connecting flight (scheduled to leave at 10:30), we should go upstairs to the ticket office to get re-booked. Apparently, they didn't know, despite servicing that airport, that Heathrow pretty much shuts down at 10pm and so the ticket offices were already deserted by the time we got there and the terminal gates shut down. This left us stranded at the airport, with no instructions or assistance, or any idea what we were supposed to do. We happened to ask a worker at the airport and he said we should check to see if our bags were there. Come to find out, our bags had been taken off the plane and set aside (not on the carousel). No one with Air Canada let us know our bags would be dropped off at Heathrow, rather than go straight to Cairo as originally planned. Obviously, whomever removed the bags knew we wouldn't be able to get on the next flight, even though no one else seemed to. If it hadn't been for the airport employee, we wouldn't have even known our bags were and they would have been inadvertently abandoned. We had to stay at the airport until the ticket office re-opened at 6:30 a.m. Once we got there, the Air Canada employee said a ticket agent would have been waiting outside the plane for us, to provide a hotel room. I'm not sure how we were supposed to know this when we were told conflicting information by the flight crew and the only people we saw waiting at the gate were there to help some disabled travelers in need of assistance. No one had a sign with our name or anything which would allow us to know that steps had been taken to provide us with a place to sleep. As a result of this delay, we lost a full day of a paid tour in Egypt and incurred expenses at the airport for food and beverages, since the next flight wasn't until 2pm that following day. In our complaint to Air Canada, they offered a discount for a future booking and didn't even address reimbursement for our out-of-pocket loss. I've made numerous international flights and this is the first time I've had any substantive issues with an airline. Air Canada's attitude, communication, and helpfulness are, by far, the absolute worst of any airline I've dealt with.

871,put the needs of customers second,C Pang,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to Toronto. The plane was delayed by around half an hour due to the late arrival of the aircraft. Halfway through the flight, about 40 minutes or so before we were scheduled to land at Billy Bishop Airport in downtown Toronto, the crew announced that the plane needed to be diverted to Pearson Airport, around 1hr away from downtown. Of course everyone was upset, but the reason given for the diversion was that (due to the delayed departure), the downtown airport was closed due to the night curfew. It was around 21.45hrs at the time, so I assumed the curfew was at 22.00hrs. Once we landed at Pearson, a manager came onboard and contradicted what was stated earlier. The plane was diverted because the crew were based at and needed to return to Pearson Airport. There were around 40 passengers aboard, and the time and inconvenience of these passengers were less important than the time of their crew. While I empathise with the plight of the hardworking crew, it says a lot about an airline that would put the needs of its customers second. And the airport curfew at Billy Bishop that the passengers were informed about and initially used as the justification for the diversion? It's 23.00hrs, meaning we had plenty of time to land. So the airline lied.",24th December 2016,Business,Economy Class,YUL to YTZ,Dec-16,2,2,2,0,3,0,3,88

873,no customer service for lost items,Jamie Marwick,VerifiedReview,"  Don't use Air Canada if there's the remote possibility you might leave something of value on the plane. Their chat service and baggage centre number's is unresponsive (no one answers the phone or chat sessions) with only five days to recover the item. While travelling from December 18, 2016 from Ottawa to Moncton the second flight, AC7502, was delayed on the Montreal tarmac for an hour and a half. As I had a two hour layover between the arrival of the flight in Moncton and the departure of my connecting bus this would only leave a half hour but with the baggage about twenty minutes at best. My issue isn't with the delayed flight but with the complete and total lack of customer support. While rushing to get off the plane to ensure I got to the bus stop outside the airport in time I had accidentally left my Kobo eBook reader in the pouch on the seat in front of me. I only realized it was missing once I was on the bus. I tried repeatedly calling the Air Canada toll free baggage centre number 1-888-689-2247 over the next few days and after an hour of waiting each time never got a representative. The recorded message prior to the hold music advised for missing items on a plane to ""chat"" with a chat representative. I tried that as well and found that not only was the chat window freezing and unresponsive (if you tried typing there was a significant delay before letters would show in the chat window) but I never could get ahold of a chat representative after another hour of waiting. I wasn't sure if the chat session was working and I tried repeatedly over the next few days without success. I had found, though, that the Air Canada policy was to hold lost and found items for five days. It's now the fifth day and after repeated attempts I still can't get a response by phone or chat. I also sent a form filled message to their general customer support feedback but only received a confirmation of receipt and not actual feedback on the lost item. My issue isn't with the delayed flight or poor customer service. My issue is that there's surprisingly no customer service for lost items. I advise anyone who doesn't want to be in the same position and would at least a chance at recovering a forgotten item left on a plane not to use Air Canada.",22nd December 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YOW to YQM via YUL,Dec-16,3,3,0,0,1,0,3,88
874,it was another good flight,Claudio Rallo,VerifiedReview,"  Amsterdam to Ottawa via London. Unlike the previous two times when I transferred at Toronto Pearson, I now made a stopover at London Heathrow so it was an interline flight with British Airways. I tend to choose for Air Canada on the route between Amsterdam and Ottawa because it is generally cheaper and has a better schedule than the competition. It was a really smooth 7-hour long plane trip, and the airplane used on the London to Ottawa route is the usual Boeing 767-300ER, an old but always reliable workhorse in the medium-sized, long-range plane repertoire. The cabin crew members were nice and worked very efficiently. I use Air Canada often and while the drinks and snacks are good, I have come to refusing the main meal because in economy class they always serve the same two things and they're simply uneatable. I really do believe that Air Canada could come up with better standard economy class meals. The legroom was good enough and there was a good choice of films and shows on the inflight entertainment system.

I was told if I want to ensure getting on one of their flights in the future, I should log on 24 hours before flight, and pay to select a seat online. What a joke.

I asked - politely - if they could be quieter. Didn't work as they came back again, so a sleepless flight. Some FAs rude too. FA selling duty free said 'why don't you read the guide' when I asked about a particular scotch. Inflight entertainment selections poor and touch screen controls unresponsive. Food mediocre at best.

Booked a seat in the ""Preferred"" section for extra legroom. The agents at YUL were very friendly but the cabin crew had no smiles to spare, and were surly to boot.

878,cabin crew very friendly,Hugo Li,Not Verified,"Toronto to Hong Kong. Overall, Air Canada provided me with the basics of this long haul trip. The food was good and the portion is definitely enough for a flight. Entertainment was one of the great things I enjoyed on this flight, a very through collection of music, TV, movies etc. Air Canada could loosen up their seating for longer flights because they really have to understand this is their customer's home for the next 12-16 hours. Make the seats wider would be a great improvement instead of trying to use every space possible to squish in passengers. Basics provided and I'm really not that picky about anything else. Cabin crew were very friendly on this long haul flight, they will tend to your needs very continually and doing everything with their given resources to make you have a better flight experience.",6th December 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to HKG,Jan-16,2,4,4,4,3,0,3,88

The check in was ok - although a gold member, I was not given the code to enter the lounge and had to spend time finding it. The flight was very good. It was only 3 hours long, seats had IFE with a good choice. SeatS were OK for a short haul flight. Cabin crew was quite attentive. We were offered a hot drink. I would expect also a small snack for the cost of this flight.

880,a reasonable flight,G Brambilla,VerifiedReview," Toronto to Rochester with Air Canada in economy. This short flight is carried out by a very small airplane, with a total of about 20 seats. Boarding was very fast (only 4 passengers). The pilots were very friendly, and the co pilot gave us safety instructions before taking off. The flight was noisy and there was a bit of draft inside the plane. Seats were not particularly comfortable, but they were OK for a short flight across the lake. When arriving at ROC, our luggage was promptly delivered to the terminal and arrived with us. A reasonable flight.

Press the button to call them and they took 10-12 mins to come to me. The food served is not enough for me, and had to ask them for something to eat. They do not offer alcohol and don't carry it on top of their trollies. They will give it to only if you ask them but they will not ask you for a refill. No hot towels either.

883,no complaints about the short flight,M Marshall,VerifiedReview," First time flying Air Canada to fly from the U.S. to Montreal in the province of Quebec. The flight, in general, was comfortable and did not have any guffaws, save for a bumpy descent (which, I must emphasize, is not in any way the crew's nor the pilots' fault). The plane was only half-full, and we were asked to distribute ourselves in the flight. Cabin service consisted of beverages, no nibbles and on both segments of the flight, the flight attendants asked if we wanted a second round of drinks. No complaints about the short flight and will certainly fly with them again in the future.",26th November 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,PHL to YUL,Nov-16,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,89
884,the plane was only about one half full,B Johnson,VerifiedReview,  Flew London Heathrow to Toronto and return. Our return flight was on a Tuesday afternoon 3pm flight with Air Canada on a 777. We were surprised to see the plane was only about one half full. I haven't seen that in a while. It made for a very pleasant flight. My wife and I each had a row of seats to spread out in. The Air Canada staff was very good. They were very good about beverage service. The meal however was almost inedible. It was a beautiful day and a portion of the flight was over Greenland. Some great scenery. We were on time and with the open seats we had a great flight. Too bad you can't count on that.,24th November 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to YYZ,Sep-16,4,4,2,2,4,0,4,89
885,about as good as economy gets,B Johnson,VerifiedReview," We flew Air Canada from Toronto To London Heathrow on a Boeing 777. The flight left on time, almost midnight. The flight was completely full. We had seats in the back of the plane. Most of the rows of seats are 3 - 4 - 3. In the back some rows are only 2 across. That's what we were assigned. There was a little extra room to the outside seat, but, the seats were pretty cramped, knee room was minimal. The food was not very good. It was a night flight, so we weren't very hungry. The entertainment system was so-so, The movie selection was not very good. A few recent movies and some old TV shows. Even the music selection was minimal. The Air Canada staff was pretty good. They were friendly and helpful, even though the plane was full. They made frequent passes with cold water. All in all it was a pretty good flight.

886,the airline of my choice,Bobby Giannakopoulos,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to New York-LaGuardia. I travel often with Air Canada because it's the airline of my choice and there's always good route options out of Montreal which is one of their main hubs.  I chose LaGuardia airport because there's more flights than Newark airport. The flights were operated by Sky Regional their airline partner on short haul legs. I was suppose to take a morning flight however I ended up taking an afternoon flight because I had a Business Class booking on stand by and the morning flights were oversold. My flights were full, gates agents were asking for volunteers to check in some oversize carry on bags. I had a seat on the economy cabin because there were upgrades last minute. The return flight was Business class. All the flights were good. The service was pretzels with a drink in economy class and a light snack with a drink in Business class. The flight attendant was very nice on the inbound flight, taking good care of me and my family during the flight. The flight attendant was fine on the return leg but she was a bit exhausted. Inflight  entertainment was very good for a short flight. There was a choice of movies and tv shows on the screens on each seat. I took the same leg a few years ago on American Eagle and the aircraft was smaller no in flying entertainment. The service with Air Canada is much better. I would fly again with this airline without hesitation.",19th November 2016,Family Leisure,Business Class,YUL to LGA,Nov-16,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,89

Air Canada 787 Dreamliner from Istanbul to Toronto. Very strict security in Istanbul for Air Canada, very reassuring. The flight in economy was excellent, aisle seat. Very comfortable seat, I am 5'8"" and had no problem with room, seat between me and the window seat was empty. The flight attendants couldn't have been nicer, great service, after first meal and drink service, water runs every half hour, the flight attendants didn't disappear, and were always available. Mid flight snack and another meal before landing, all acceptable and hot. The size of the windows, humidity levels and fresh air were wonderful, no dryness. An excellent aircraft and product from Air Canada. Flight from Toronto to Ottawa was normal on an A320.

888,not worth the money,Phuong Nguyen,Not Verified,"Hong Kong to Vancouver. I have flown Air Canada several times both long-haul with the Dreamliner and short-haul within Canada. Biggest complaints: A meal is not served on flights within Canada, even though it's 4-5 hours long and the price is very high. You basically get a small bag of pretzel or a cookie. On the long-haul flights, I dont know why the food on flights to Asia is way better than to Europe. Second thing on the long-haul flights, there are not enough washroom. All flights on the B787 people were constantly lining up in front of the washrooms. I do not think it's worth the money because the amount you pay for your flights in Canada is ridiculously high but you get minimum service.",15th November 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,HKG to YVR,May-16,3,2,2,3,4,0,1,89
889,staff always understanding,C Fung,Not Verified,Toronto to Vancouver. As a nervous flyer I find the Air Canada staff to always be understanding. The new dreamliner planes have a configuration that doesn't squish 4 people in a row in the middle. The interior ceiling of the aircraft is very high so it doesn't feel as claustrophobic as some of the smaller planes.

890,the seats were the most uncomfortable I have flown,A Estefan,Not Verified,"For a while now, I have believed that Air Canada have the edge over British Airways on this route. Whereas BA seem to have slipped into complacency and slimming down their service, Air Canada have upped their game and provided superior service and comfort. However, this month I had the displeasure of flying on their new 787 in economy class. Although the service was, as usual, very good, the seats were the most uncomfortable I have flown in for a long time. The new 787 economy seat is incredibly narrow, offering little sideways movement and virtually no room for the arms. When I managed to rest my left arm on the seat, I was setting off the call bell because the entertainment controls are located exactly where you would rest your arm, very poor design indeed. I also noticed that the quality of inflight catering has dropped, too. I had only one option to choose from: a rather unpleasant overcooked pasta dish which was, basically, pasta with tinned tomato on it and some cheese. I would like to be able to say I will stick with Air Canada, and if I am able to fly premium economy or business, I likely would. If I was forced to take an economy flight, I am fairly sure I will be looking elsewhere.",14th November 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YYC to LHR,Nov-16,1,4,3,4,5,0,4,90
891,flight crew were pretty polite,Nicolò Riva,Not Verified,"Flew Air Canada on a leisure trip to Toronto in August and I had a pretty good experience. From boarding the flight crew were pretty polite and kind and they kept this attitude for the entire flight. Seat spacing in the front of the economy cabin was excellent although it seemed to be a bit narrower in the aft part. Spacing allowed me to have a comfortable outbound flight and to rest quietly on the inbound night flight to Milan. On both flight airplane left the gate later than the schedule resulting in half an hour delay on the scheduled arrival in Toronto while we landed on time in Milan. Food wasn't bad, had lunch and a snack during the flight to Toronto while dinner and breakfast on the flight to Milan. For lunch and dinner passengers can choose between pasta or chicken menu, the snack is a sort of piadina containing vegetables or chicken. Breakfast was a cookie with coffee, juice or whatever you prefer. Good experience at all.",13th November 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MXP to YYZ,Aug-16,5,5,4,4,5,0,5,90
892,poor customer service,Peter Clements,VerifiedReview,"  Halifax to London Heathrow via Toronto. We booked a flight to London for my wife. We made sure it was the direct flight as well to make it easier for her. Also booked it early to make sure we got what we wanted. Near the departure date, we got an e mail to say that her itinerary was changed to via Toronto. I phoned the airline and they told me the flight had been taken off and said book another day or accept what you have. It was a take it or leave it situation. Of course we had to take it. So she endured a long and difficult day as she is less able and the connection was rushed and it was tough. Imagine her annoyance when she finally got to Heathrow to find the direct flight we previously booked arriving at much the same time! They also managed to lose her baggage! Contact with Air Canada customer service was difficult. No response to the web mail submission. Telephone calls just produced advice to resubmit the complaint - which I did and still no response. In the end I had to badger them on social media to get any contact. It took a week to get anything from them. Their response was that some time after taking our flight off, it was put back again and people who had that flight cancelled were not given the opportunity to return to that flight. So those who were wise enough to book early lost out, while those who booked late got what we were denied. They said that as a goodwill gesture they would offer us 15% discount on our next flight. Useless as we don't intend flying again this year. Hardly good will as it was their poor customer service that caused all this.

I took the business class route from Toronto to Sydney and the interior was disappointing.  The meals were awful and my headphones didn't work. My return flight was booked in error on a wrong day, and when I called to make a change to it was hung up on by a frustrated rep who refused to hear my complaint to the end and figured it was probably easiest to just hang up the call rather than deal with the issue. When I called back and explained what had happened, the new rep was unapologetic and didn't even attempt to rectify the issue in any way.

894,2 days of nightmare,P Hedron,VerifiedReview,"  Washington to Montreal. 2 days of nightmare on what should have been a 1.5 hour flight. My flight from IAD to YUL was cancelled, not one person from Air Canada could advise why - huge line was formed and approximately 2 hours later I was offered a flight the following day ""first thing in the morning"" (for Air Canada, 11 am is ""first thing in the morning""). After much effort I was able to convince them to put me on a flight to Montreal connecting through Toronto (yes, my direct flight had to be changed to a flight connecting through Toronto so I could leave on an actual ""first in the morning"" flight. So when I was finally seeing all this nightmare stop to expand itself, it was actually time for Air Canada's yet other fiasco: they couldn't reprint my ticket because it was bought by my company (business trip) and they didn't know how to do it. It was past 8 pm, I thought I would be home in Montreal at 7 pm, and I was still in Washington DC getting my ticket reprinted. After they were finally able to, I was given a 15 dollars voucher for dinner that I had to use in a hotel's restaurant where the cheapest meal was 30 (or 40 if you added taxes and tip). In addition to that, I was refused a cab service to and from that hotel, and was told to use the free shuttle which started running 4:40 am (and my boarding time was 5:30 am). I arrived Toronto at 8 am and there was a flight to Montreal with room for more people but I couldn't get in because my luggage was on a different schedule, so I had to wait until 10 am to fly to Montreal. Heading to the final moments of this torture which was being ""served"" by Air Canada, I just hear right now them saying the 10 am flight to montreal was overbooked and not all of us may flight.

Air Canada put me up in a hotel overnight in Toronto, and rebooked my flights through to Podgorica over the following days. However, after spending almost 12 hrs in IST, I wasn't allowed to board my final flight to TGD because Air Canada had failed to issue the ticket in the computer system. Their transfer counter was empty, so I was left with no other choice than to rebook (at my own expense) the final leg of my flight (which left another 12hrs later). In the end, I had to spend 24hrs in the Istanbul airport, and am out $700 for the rebooking, which Air Canada is refusing to reimburse. And the best Air Canada can apparently offer is 30% off a future booking. As if I would every choose to fly with them again. Every step of the way with this company has shown me just how incredibly incompetent they are, and I strongly discourage anyone from ever flying with them.

901,specialises in appalling experiences,J Fang,VerifiedReview," Victoria to London Heathrow via Vancouver. Air Canada specialises in providing passengers with appalling experiences. Cancelled my flight from YYJ to YVR at the very last minute. This meant I would miss my flight from YVR to LHR. Air Canada rebooked me on the same flight, but on the following day, meaning I would lose 1 full day from my holiday time. AC staff unhelpful. After much discussion and haggling, I was able to put myself on a later flight from YYJ to YVR, and then from YVR to LHR with a British Airways flight. The lone cabin crew on YYJ to YVR flight AC 8078 appeared so disinterested in passengers - couldn't be bother to even say hello as we boarded and exited the plane. AC 8078 was on a noisy, extremely uncomfortable Bombardier Dash 8-300 propeller plane. Even a 30 minute flight felt like an eternity. Return trip from LHR to YVR and onto YYJ. LHR to YVR on AC high density B777-300ER. Although I had a spare seat next to me, it was impossible to relax, given how cramped the seating was. Aisles were extremely narrow - flight attendants continuously bumped into me. Sleep or rest was impossible. YVR - YYJ sector was again on the Bombardier Dash 8-300 propeller plane.

903,service is impeccable,Chris Summers,VerifiedReview,"  First flight in Business Class with Air Canada from London Heathrow to Montreal. First noted was the ease at T2 and the great service in the Maple Lounge. After take off we were served drinks and snacks that were topped up without waiting for the trolley to come around. Amazing service so far against BA who I normally fly with and Gold member. What is good is the layout of seats, you don't sit facing a random person plus you don't have to climb over anyone to go to the toilet if in a window seat. The tables are great and the cabin crew come and bring a table cloth before they bring the food, another plus better than BA. Appetiser was first class, salmon and salad. Main was a rack of lamb followed by cheese and a selection of ice cream followed by a port. The service is impeccable compared to BA and I think BA is overrated just because of the brand. The plus point is Air Canada is 50% cheaper than BA. So far 3 hours into the flight and cannot fault it. Seats turn into a very comfy spacious bed and again lots of space / storage to put things especially if you wear glasses. Cannot fault Air Canada and it's crew.

I have emailed customer service multiple times with no reply. I went to the Air Canada customer service agents at the airport and they said there is nothing they can do. The last time the stewards tried to hand out one of those cards I laughed said why bother you can't claim them. I have been sharing this experience with other colleagues and they say they have had the same experience which is why they fly WestJet. This experience is eroding my loyalty to Air Canada.

Ridiculously uptight carry-on weight restriction enforcement. Incomprehensible system for carry-on baggage whereby some is put in the hold, but no clear information on how this works, where to leave, where to pick up.

908,reached the point where enough is enough,P Knowles,VerifiedReview," Toronto to Sudbury with Air Canada. For a while I was purposefully flying Air Canada over other carriers as I enjoyed their new inflight entertainment options, but I've reached the point where enough is enough. I could have excused the fact that on about a third of the flights I've taken the sound or screen is broken, as technology fails. I could have excused that they keep adding new fees such as a fee to choose your seat in advance (not just for legroom anymore, for any seat). But this time I feel that I've run into an inexcusably unethical practice that has significantly disrupted my vacation plans. I've been on a multiple-destination vacation, which will take me on 6 flights. Air Canada's pricing structure made it costly to mix and match airlines, so all six flights were with Air Canada. I had decided to cancel the third flight, and drive the distance instead, so that I could see more family members. I didn't care if they charged me for the flight, I just wanted to notify them of the change of plans. When I called Air Canada, they told me that if I did this, they would charge me nearly $400, a $200 cancellation fee as well as the increased cost of the fourth flight, as it would need to be ""re-booked"". Then they told me that if I didn't pay this amount and didn't show up for the third flight, they would cancel the fourth flight. So even though I was willing to pay the same for less service, they wanted to charge me substantially more. They didn't offer any justification, I'm assuming that it's just designed to take advantage of people who are in a tough spot and have to change their plans, regardless of whether it increases the airline's cost. Pure greed. Even if it leads to additional administration, I couldn't see this amount being reasonable. Then, to top it off, I had asked if I could pay more to switch my last two flights to a later time. Online the price was $761 if I was booking a new flight. However, I was told that to make this change they would charge me almost an extra $1000. I'm absolutely disgusted, and will definitely be sticking to Westjet or other airlines.",18th October 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to YSB,Oct-16,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,91

911,staff I talked to was really rude,S Raish,VerifiedReview,  La Guardia to Toronto. I travel with Air Canada for business almost once a month. I wanted to talk to the staff regarding standby options but the staff I talked to was really rude and did not even answer my question. I would consider using other options instead of Air Canada from now on. I am very disappointed with their customer service.,11th October 2016,Business,Economy Class,LGA to YYZ,Oct-16,4,4,0,0,1,0,1,92
912,needs to improve in a couple of areas,W Johnson,VerifiedReview,"  My husband and I travelled from Vancouver to Sydney with Air Canada in September 2016. We had a reasonably comfortable flight but Air Canada needs to improve in a couple of areas. Firstly: all the controls for entertainment, lights etc are in the armrest which is very inconvenient as it is too easy to accidentally turn off or on something unintentionally. I understand this can only be improved when designing new aeroplanes. Secondly: the choice of movies, tv etc on the entertainment system is very limited. On a 16 hour flight people need more than a few old re-runs and a couple of newer movies perhaps not to taste. Thirdly: neither on this flight nor our previous premium economy flight from Sydney to Vancouver were we given enough time to eat our food. Meals appear to be served so close to landing there is a rush to collect rubbish before people have time to eat. Staff commenced collecting plates before I even had time to take the lid off my meal. Most of my meal was wasted and it looked to be quite appetising. BTW I'm not a slow eater. Otherwise Air Canada was equal to most other international airlines and I appreciated being able to fly directly from Sydney to Vancouver and return.",9th October 2016,Couple Leisure,Business Class,YVR to SYD ,Sep-16,3,3,4,2,4,0,3,92
913,arrived 4 hours late,Jason Gansauer,Not Verified,"Chicago to Dublin via Toronto with Air Canada. Plane left Chicago 40 minutes late and arrived in Toronto 40 minutes late. We were not allowed to board our flight to Dublin because the agent said the plane was ""full,"" apparently with standbys. We waited in the customer service line for 45 minutes while the agent worked on another flight. She told us, eventually, that we could ""take our chances"" with a direct flight or have a certain one to London then Dublin. It appeared to me that she was ""selling"" us and the 10 other passengers in the same predicament on the second flight because it wasn't full. It too was delayed, waiting for a late connecting flight from Beijing. How nice. We eventually arrived in Dublin 4 hours late without luggage which arrived 24 hours later. When I contacted Air Canada about all of this, they were gracious enough to offer us a 15% discount on our next AC flight which I will summarize by saying - never. Don't believe me? Check the numerous comments and reviews about this sorry excuse for an airline.",9th October 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to DUB via YYZ,Sep-16,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,92
914,AC was like a budget airline,G Anderson,VerifiedReview,"  It was my first time with Air Canada flying from London to Montreal. I have to say that the aircraft was good indeed. However my strong impression was that AC was like a budget airline. Inflight entertainment was limited and didn't work for my wife. We needed to ask to re-set it several times. Seats are not comfortable because armrests have built-in remote for inflight entertainment system and lights and you switch it off/on every time when you place your elbow on it accidentally. Serving food: items constantly were dropped down, flight attendants were picking them up from the floor and put on your table. Indeed it was better than United based on my many-year experience but still very close to it. My personal impression - Ryanair is treating their passengers a little bit better inflight - more genuine and attentive. Also, Montreal airport don't recognize Star Alliance membership card privileges for priority check-in which was disappointing (but it was not the airlines fault, but the airport ground staff). AC can be airline of choice indeed if there no any other suitable options.",4th October 2016,Business,Economy Class,LHR to YUL,Oct-16,2,2,2,1,1,0,2,92
915,a very enjoyable flight,Edmund Diesner,VerifiedReview, Paris CDG to Montreal with Air Canada. Flight left on time. The flight crew were very friendly and attentive especially one who was smiling from the moment we boarded to the moment we left the plane. The food served was the best food I have ever had on Air Canada in all the years flying with them. Probably because it was made in Paris and not Vancouver. - it was quite good. The entertainment system worked fine and it was a very enjoyable flight.

917,representative rude and discourteous,Jeffrey Brock,VerifiedReview,"  Nashville to London Gatwick via Toronto. Air Canada is the worst we've flown. Sept 7, 2016, a 1.5 hour take off delay from Nashville due to our plane's having no air conditioning, and with the air blowers at only 10% of capacity. Problem was not fixed and the cabin temp was nearly unbearable for the 2-hour packed flight to Toronto. The delay cost us a missed connection to London Gatwick because the airline schedules only 1-1/2 hours to connect from the Nashville arrival to their once-a-day London Gatwick departure. To make matters worse, in the process of deplaning from the Nashville flight there were no airline personnel directing US citizens to the shortcut past Canadian customs, which forced many US citizens on our flight, including us, to spend an hour waiting to go through customs, then another hour reclaiming our baggage, checking it back in, and going back through security, none of which US citizens at Toronto are required to do. The airline had booked us on the next Gatwick flight, 24 hours later, but we were able to get a flight that night to London Heathrow, which was delayed by 2 hours due to technical problems. We finally left at midnight. Through this ordeal every single Air Canada representative was rude and discourteous.  The airline would do nothing for us except give us $10 food certificates which bought us 2 bottles of water. We had not eaten anything by this time for 7 hours and did not get anything to eat until 2 hours into the London Heathrow flight. Because our rental car had been paid for at Gatwick with return of the car to be made there we were forced, upon arrival at Heathrow, to take a commuter bus at our cost, from Heathrow to Gatwick.  The return flight from Gatwick to Toronto was delayed by over 4 hours due to the failure of a  ticket agent at Gatwick to give a fellow passenger more than one claim tag for the two bags she had checked in. This failure caused an extra bag to show up in the system. Staff  were in an out of the cabin for the 4 hours trying to determine the bag's owner. As a last resort, the airline ordered all the passengers out of the plane and down to the tarmac to personally identify their own bags! The delay caused everyone on the plane to miss their connections in Toronto. The next available flight to Nashville was 24 hours later. The airline put us in an hotel 20 minutes from the airport and included 3 meal vouchers which could only be used at the hotel. Trouble is, the hotel didn't even have a restaurant. It took 1.5 hours to get our bags out of the secure area for the overnight stay.",3rd October 2016,Business,Economy Class,BNA to LGW via YYZ,Sep-16,3,4,2,0,1,0,1,92

919,flight was not that great,K Shanivan,VerifiedReview,"  The flight was a Lufthansa / Air Canada codeshare flight from Frankfurt to Toronto. It was my first time flying Air Canada. The flight was not that great. The movies were boring. I ordered for Asian Vegetarian Meal as a special meal request, which mostly consists of Indian food, but the food was not good. Also, since it was an 8 hour flight, they should have provided 2 meals. Although they provided lunch, which was at the start of the flight, their second meal was a refreshment, which was only a packet of nuts.  Maybe a light meal towards the end of the flight was probably too much to ask. The cabin crew were quite lousy, I had to press the call button many times and they still would not come.",22nd September 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,FRA to YYZ,Sep-16,4,2,2,2,3,0,4,92

If that wasn't enough, my luggage did not arrive, they never boarded it on the plane, and it arrives 2 days after me, and after they had me wait up until 23:30 at night to deliver it. When confronting their customer service, they shortly referred me to their creative legal terms, not even trying to address my complaint. Plenty of other options for travel.

923,"solid experience, nothing special",Max Blanck,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to Rome. This was my first flight with Air Canada and it was a mixed experience. On boarding I found the plane to be clean and well kept and the cabin crew was friendly. We hit some severe turbulence shortly after take-off so the IFE headphones were given to us only a good 40 minutes into the flight. Seats were reasonably comfortable and legroom was good for me standing only 172cm tall. IFE selection was wide and for the first time I had no trouble listening to the sound through Economy class headphones provided. What really stood out negatively was the food. I selected the pasta and it was the worst I have been served on a long haul flight. On the bright side, alcoholic beverages were complimentary. Breakfast consisted of a slice of banana bread and a cup of coffee. The bare minimum I dare say. Flight was on time and information from the cockpit plentiful. All in all the flight was a solid experience, just nothing special.",13th September 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YUL to FCO,Aug-16,4,3,1,4,3,0,4,93

926,improved their service remarkably,V Sung,Not Verified,"Air Canada has improved their service remarkably over the past few years, adding some fresh new faces to the cabin crew lineup. We took our seats in the emergency exit row, which gave us extra legroom. The flight was approximately four hours long from Toronto to Calgary, mostly turbulent so the seatbelt sign was on most of the time, but the pilot and cabin crew did their best to keep us comfortable with regular updates and advice on when to head to the washrooms. The flight attendants were very helpful and cheery. Other than that, fairly standard beverage and snack fare, nothing memorable but nothing too horrible either. In-flight entertainment was very updated and had a wide variety of movies and TV to watch.",9th September 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to YYC,Jul-16,4,5,0,5,5,0,3,93
927,no apology could satisfy me,S Mason,Not Verified,"Toronto to London Heathrow via Montreal. Normally am pleased with smooth travel experience with Air Canada. On Aug 25, however, I checked my suitcase in and boarded the aircraft, flew in to Montreal. Had a 2.5 hour wait time until the next flight. That flight boarded ok and we landed the next morning at Heathrow, and the 'adventure' began. My suitcase did not arrive. I very nearly missed my train at the mainline station I had to travel to because I had to report the missing bag to the agent, who took my details, provided me with an information sheet and file tracking number, and told me my bag was on the next flight. Couldn't seem to tell me why. After a few follow up calls without meaningful responses from the people at the number I was given to call, as well as from the courier, I also learned that the baggage department and the courier do not communicate to each other. That needs to change! Courier delivered my suitcase directly to me 3 days after my arrival. I got a bit of a runaround obtaining information on how best to proceed with submitting my receipts for reimbursement because the form wanted me to send to an address in the UK, but I reside in Canada. I was given instructions eventually and followed that with a letter plus documentation sent off to the baggage department in Dorval, Quebec. It is unacceptable to me that the airline (or whoever it was) should arbitrarily decide who's bag arrives with them and who's does not, especially when you are flying on their largest aircraft, and particularly failing to communicate this information to the passenger. I am not impressed, I am waiting for my reimbursement, and the days of me doing business with Air Canada are now seriously numbered. I understand they do this quite regularly but it is not acceptable. You leave your luggage in their hands and this is what they do? There is no explanation, no reason or excuse, and no apology could satisfy me on this one.",8th September 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to LHR via YUL,Sep-16,3,3,0,0,3,0,3,93
928,a very positive experience,Tanya Brann,Not Verified,"We were flying from Rome to Montreal with Air Canada on September 2 and it was one of the smoothest flights! Professional crew, very helpful and accommodating. There was a crying baby near us and a flight attendant actually took the baby in his arms and played with her to calm her down. The pilot kept the passengers informed as much as he could on what was going on (we had to wait for about an hour for the takeoff clearance which was not Air Canada's fault, the boarding was completed on time), he apologized for the temperature in the cabin while we were waiting for takeoff, suggested ways to keep it cool, he made informative announcements throughout the flight, and the best landing I've experienced in years. The food was ok, we were served gelato as a snack which was great. No problems with luggage. No problems with pre-booking of seats. Overall, a very positive experience, I don't think you can ask for much more on a long overseas flight in economy class.",7th September 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,FCO to YUL,Sep-16,3,5,4,4,5,3,4,93
929,checked us in was not friendlier,Laurent Juillard,VerifiedReview,  Quebec to Toronto via Montreal. Lined up at the gate checking desk for 20 minutes. When our turn came the guy told us that he did only luggage drop off and invited us to line up again at the counter next to his. Quite a few people ahead of us. Then a few minutes later while we were still lining up we saw him checking people without any boarding passes. Then the person that checked us in was not any friendlier. This happened at the Jean Lesage Airport which was surprising because the people in Quebec were just the nicest people and because as Air Canada frequent users we never had to deal with such unpleasant people.,5th September 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YQB to YYZ via YUL,Sep-16,2,3,0,0,1,0,3,93
930,customer focused carrier,T Eldem,Not Verified,"São Paulo to Toronto with Air Canada. I connected to this flight from a domestic flight and was concerned about my bag not making it as the two airlines were not affiliated. Upon check in, the customer care provided to my concern was exceptional. I had two check in agents plus the AC Concierge tracking my bag which safely made it to the flight. I am a loyal AC flyer and in all of my travels over the years I have never experienced this level of attention and superior service. The ground crew was phenomenal and did their jobs with smiles and without a hint of frustration. On board, aside from the age of the aircraft and the worn-out interior, service, amenities, food and beverages were of high standards. I chose to sleep most of the flight and got a good 6-7 hours of shuteye. Flight left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. The work of the ground crew in GRU was the highlight of my travel experience and went a long way in renewing my trust in AC as a customer focused carrier.",3rd September 2016,Business,Business Class,GRU to YYZ,Sep-16,3,5,4,4,5,0,4,94
931,experience at best mediocre,T Eldem,Not Verified,"Air Canada from Toronto to São Paulo. Check in using the premium/priority lane was quick and effortless. Visited the Maple Leaf Lounge briefly and must say AC is slipping in the lounge product it offers. On board the aircraft clearly showed its age with worn out interior, dim lighting, poor air quality and general appearance. Once airborne, the FA's came around and read out the menu to each passenger as they did not have any printed versions. I could not help but feel sorry for the FA who had to repeat the same script 23 times. The food was mediocre at best with quality well below a business class offering. The drinks selection however was decent. The IFE had a reasonable selection of new releases but the music selection remains obscure and totally irrelevant. I would like to know who actually appriciates AC's music selection. The service director did an admirable job interacting with passengers which gave the journey a personal touch. The seat was the usual pod style and less than comfortable in the flat position. The toilets looked grimy and in need of a thorough scrub. Flight left and arrived on time and although it was tagged as ""priority"" my bag came out very late during delivery. The experience was at best mediocre and well below what one would expect in business class.",31st August 2016,Business,Business Class,YYZ to GRU,Aug-16,3,4,2,3,5,0,3,94

933,service was great,J Pritchett,Not Verified,"Kamloops to Sydney via Vancouver with Air Canada. I have used Air Canada a lot for my business travel over a number of years, and I have always been satisfied with my experience. Recently, my partner and I planned a trip to Australia for the very first time. I have never flown Air Canada ""internationally"" before so I wasn't sure what to expect. We found our check in online to be very smooth and quick the night before. The first flight from YKA to YVR was smooth like always. The Air Canada employees at YKA are very helpful when it comes to dropping off your bag, and sending the luggage through to our final destination. Once we arrived at YVR (in the evening), we went through security and customs, and then had a nice dinner in the international side of YVR. Our flight from YVR to SYD was scheduled to leave at 11:40, and we left pretty much right on time. We were seated in ""Premium Economy"", and I was very satisfied with the seat comfort and our space. There are only 3 rows of seats for premium economy, which made the long flight comfortable, and less claustrophobic. The service was great, the food wasn't too bad, the entertainment was very good, and the cabin crew checked on us quite frequently throughout our flight. We arrived into SYD in the morning, feeling fairly fresh and rested from our flight. Overall, all 4 flights with Air Canada were very good. Everything was on schedule, and the staff that we interacted with were very helpful to us on our journey. If we go back to Australia again at some point, we will definitely take Air Canada again.",27th August 2016,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,YKA to SYD via YVR,Jul-16,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,94
934,not sympathetic or helpful,John Smith,Not Verified,"My wife and I recently took a trip to Montreal, Canada from Salt Lake City - USA, and we flew with Air Canada. Pretty much everything that could possibly go wrong with a travel experience happened. We were stuck on the aircraft for an hour after it had landed, and were certain to miss our connecting flight. Air Canada’s poor communication caused my wife and me to run across 8 terminals at LAX airport carrying our carry-ons and backpacks, to try to reach the connecting flight before it departed. The flight didn’t end up leaving for 2 more hours. During the 5-6 hour flight we were not once offered snacks. When we landed in Montreal our luggage was missing, and we were informed that it was still in LAX. We ended up having to come back to the airport later that night, wasting our vacation time and wasting money on gas and parking. The return flights home were even more of a nightmare. At our connecting flight in Toronto, we were denied access to the plane because Air Canada had overbooked. We had bought our tickets 2 months in advance, but that made no difference to them. The Air Canada representative was not sympathetic or helpful at all. We were put in a hotel for the night, as the next flight to Salt Lake wasn’t until the next morning, and we now had yet another 4 hour layover in Chicago on top of that. The 'compensation' isn't even close to cover our expenses, loss, and stress. When we finally landed in SLC, Air Canada had failed yet again to get our luggage to our destination. There was not even one Air Canada representative anywhere in the entire airport to help us or give us any amount of information. I had to call and wait a half hour on the phone before I got in touch with an Air Canada rep, who then informed me our luggage was still in Chicago.

We were on holidays so both my girlfriend and I were very relaxed and this helped a lot during the 40+ minutes wait during check-in while they try to sort out an issue with the luggage fee that for some reasons I could not pay as they system was not accepting any of my credit card. Luckily I got to the airport much earlier than necessary. The lady at the counter was very nice and helpful and apologized many times for the inconvenience so no big deal in the end, such things can happen. Flight left on time and flight was smooth even though cabin was pretty cold but with AC even blankets are for sale, at least on domestic routes, so we gave up getting one. I did not buy any food or drink as we had our own. Crew members were friendly and smiling while info from the flight deck was very limited.

Then I wait in an hour long line to get my connection flight from Toronto to Madrid changed only to add an extra layover and I am now arriving 8 hours later in Madrid. I am instructed to call customer service since I am unhappy with the solution so I wait 30 minute to talk with a customer service rep only to be told that they cannot do anything for me since I have already been checked in. 1 extra layover, arriving 8 hours later at our destination than originally expected, they can't get me a seat on the plane next to my wife, and the customer service reps can't do anything for me. I will never fly Air Canada again, they have ruined the first day of plans we had for our honeymoon.

On our last trip we were detained in Montreal whereby we needed to connect with a flight to Fort Lauderdale. It should be noted that one of the passengers required wheelchair service.

938,ground staff at AMS were useless,Stewart Gordon,VerifiedReview,"  We flew Air Canada from Amsterdam AMS to Toronto YYZ having used British Airways to fly into Amsterdam. Initially we were concerned about the 1 hour 50 minutes connection time but this was not a problem as the Air Canada flight was delayed by 2 hours and 50 minutes. Plenty of time for our baggage to make it from the incoming flight. Ground staff at AMS were useless, there were 5 of them behind the counter at the gate but only one appeared to be interested in serving passengers. Once on board, the aircraft itself was old and in serious need of TLC. The seat in front of me was split and the inner foam was bulging out. The in-flight entertainment was delivered on poor quality screens with an even poorer selection of out dated movies. The staff were pleasant enough and appeared to care about passenger needs. Upon arrival at Toronto, only 3 of our bags had made the trip with no explanation as to why one of them was still at AMS. We completed the form and were told that the bag would come on the next available flight on the following day. It didn't come, in fact it was finally reunited with us 9 days later and this was only after I had re-attended YYZ twice after being told that it was there when it wasn't. I have spent approximately 15 hours of our vacation on the phone to Air Canada's Indian call centre and yet the never made contact with me once.

YKA - YVR - SFO, July 20th and SFO - YVR - YKA, July 26th. I travelled down to the Bay Area out of Kamloops (YKA) on July 20th and returned on July 26th. All of my flights were on time, efficient, and enjoyable. I enjoyed Air Canada's Preferred Seating/Premium Economy benefits on the A319 (the way down) and the A320 (on the way up). The first people to be served, the last people to get on the plane, extra legroom, more comfortable seats, and extra space between your neighbours made my flights to and from San Francisco really enjoyable. I will recommend the extra small fee to sit in preferred seating/premium economy benefits, on any Air Canada flights. The service between Kamloops and Vancouver is always efficient and on time. Air Canada is one of my main choices for all of my flights. Not to mention, you can get a lot of frequent flyer points for whoever you are signed up with (for me, Star Alliance).

942,appalling quality food,V Lewis,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada from Toronto to London Heathrow. Appalling quality food, and profit over passenger wellbeing. Took off an hour late as inbound flight late landing, nothing they could do about that, but surely they could have given out water? Food on both outbound was of such a low quality, cheap ingredients and generally poor quality meal when compared to many other large carriers. Children meals no better, deep fried 'smiley faces' and solid tomato pasta. This was a night flight, yet the full brightness cabin lights were still on at 11pm local Toronto time simply so they could finish duty free sales. This just smells of greed for profit over passenger wellbeing. Nobody could sleep and young children and babies were distressed due to this. My wife spoke to crew about this earlier, just to be told 'after duty free they will go off'. Only upon me insisting on speaking to the purser and explaining why this was such a problem did the cabin lights then get reduced to a normal night flight level The inflight entertainment had very few new releases, mainly bulked out by old films and TV shows.",11th August 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to LHR,Aug-16,3,1,1,2,4,0,4,95
943,"supposed to leave Thursday, took-off Saturday",Heather Maimone,VerifiedReview," Cleveland to Sao Paulo via Toronto with Air Canada. We faced countless problems from the moment we started our journey to Brazil. We were scheduled to take off from Cleveland to Toronto on June 23 at 5:50pm. To then take Toronto to Sao Paulo on flight AC 0090 at 10:40pm. When I scheduled the flights, we gave ourselves plenty of time in between to go through customs and ensure that we made our flight to Brazil, as I had work meetings and an interstate flight to Rio de Janeiro on Saturday morning. The first problem we faced was our flight from Cleveland to Toronto was late arriving. There were problems with the flight or weather issues - no one really knew what was going on. We did not take off until 10pm - which didn't put us in Toronto until 11:15pm. This made us and at least 50 other people miss their international connections. Air Canada was able to put us in a hotel for that night and we were to come back the following evening for a 8pm flight to Sao Paulo, putting us in Sao Paulo now on Saturday morning at 9am. I was able to move my meeting in Rio and also called the airline to reschedule my interstate flight from Sao Paulo to Rio. We got to the airport Friday evening for our flight that is meant to take off at 8pm. We are supposed to be boarding at 7pm and there is still no plane. We were then told that the plane won't take off until 11pm and after more time told it won't take off until 9am the next morning. This now creates problems for my business meeting in Rio. After working with Air Canada customer service (who were not polite) they were able to change our flights to Rio instead of Sao Paulo so we could make our work meeting. By this time it was already 3am and if we had gone to the hotel we would have to turn around and leave 2 hours later to come back - so my husband and I slept at the airport. This was exetremely uncomfortable and we had an awful night of sleep. We finally got on the plane on Saturday morning at 9am (supposed to take off at 9:15 so we were late again) and we sat on the plane for 40 minutes with no movement. They finally announced over the speaker that there is a passenger on the plane who shouldn't be - and security was there to remove him. After an hour and a half of being stuck on the tarmac we were finally left for Brazil. We were supposed to leave on Thursday evening and weren't taking off until Saturday morning.",11th August 2016,Business,Economy Class,CLE to GRU via YYZ,Jun-16,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,95
944,a really cramped environment,Alan Cheng,Not Verified,"I used Air Canada to get from Hong Kong to Toronto-Pearson. Check in in HKG was OK, the check in workers were just ones from the Jardine company. However, there is nothing positive to say in this review other than the variety of movies in the inflight entertainment system (which crashed) and the baggage allowance. Service was not good. When you pressed the ""call attendant button"" you were ignored, or you were shouted at. My inflight entertainment system crashed. I pressed the button and nobody came for an hour. I cancelled and pressed again. The flight attendant shouted at me ""Did you press the button?"". I was gobsmacked. Generally, during meal service, their attitude was very demeaning and it seemed as if they did not want to serve us. Inflight meals on this flight were your typical airplane food. Nothing special. The seat in the plane was narrow. I used economy class and there were ten seats per row (3-4-3). This resulted in a really cramped environment. Reclining the seat was also useless. The tray tables were small and could only fit the tray and nothing else. Also, there was not much space for storage in the seat back pocket. Legroom was quite cramped, even though I am only 178 cm tall. Baggage handling at Toronto-Pearson was quite slow, despite the fact the gate (Terminal 1) was a short walk to immigration and baggage claim. I waited two hours for my bags to arrive, and I even saw the flight crew waiting even after I went to customs. Now, the only saving grace was the baggage allowance. You could take lots of hand baggage and nobody seemed to care. They were quite liberal and didn't charge me even though I exceeded the baggage allowance (check in) by 0.1 kilos.",10th August 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,HKG to YYZ,Aug-16,1,1,2,3,3,0,2,95
945,I had an excellent flight,M Gordon,Not Verified,Toronto to Vancouver. I had an excellent flight. The seat was very comfortable and IFE was excellent. The meal service and choice of wine was excellent. The staff was happy and checking if I needed anything. I look forward to flying again with Air Canada next month. One thing I was happy to see is I was able to give my meal choice early rather than watch the FA dart about the cabin ignoring many of the passengers while chatting with and taking the orders of certain passengers. I recommend you drop this practice as it is such a downer in the early part of the flight.,10th August 2016,Solo Leisure,Business Class,YYZ to YVR,Jul-16,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,95
946,positive step forwards for Air Canada,Mark Murphy,VerifiedReview," Flying to Montreal via Toronto on the newer class of Air Canada's fleet was a much more pleasant experience than expected, due to my experiences on their older models. The seats are more comfortable, with more shoulder room, and the feeling of more privacy, now that they've gone for more of a cabin feel. the extra storage space for passports, phones, wallets etc. is a welcome addition. The TV screens are large and crisp, in HD (unlike the blurry cumbersome previous screens). Food was of a very good standard, and drinks selection was of a respectable range and standard. Service was friendly and attentive. All in all this is a significantly positive step forwards for Air Canada, despite the flight being late. Of course my return journey was on an older model, with far inferior service and comfort, souring my Air Canada experience.",7th August 2016,Solo Leisure,Business Class,LHR to YUL via YYZ,Aug-16,4,4,4,5,3,0,4,95
947,I could not afford the fee,Simon Camden,VerifiedReview,"  Cranbrook to Vancouver. While sitting at my gate waiting for my flight to begin boarding I received a phone call from Air Canada to advise me that my bag had already arrived at my destination. About 5 hours earlier I had asked if it might be possible to get on an earlier flight as I arrived at the airport before I expected when I bought my ticket a month earlier. I was told it would be possible, but that I would be charged a large fee. I declined as I could not afford the fee. It seems funny to me that Air Canada had lots of room on the earlier flight for my bag, but not me. Would it have cost them anything to let me take one of the empty seats on the flight before mine? In a similar situation two years previous WestJet kindly allowed me to take a seat on an earlier flight. I",6th August 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YXC to YVR,Aug-16,3,5,0,0,1,0,1,95
948,no reasoning with them,Steven Perreault,Not Verified,"We purchased tickets for our son and his friends with Singapore Airlines from Tokyo to Montreal. The LA to Montreal leg was with Air Canada. We had many choices for this second flight but we chose Air Canada because it is Canadian and because both airlines are star Alliance members. The layover in LAX was 10 hrs so we decided to purchase access to the Maple Leaf lounge in LAX. To be able to purchase access to the lounge, the ticket had to be a Flex or Latitude class ticket which it was. Air Canada refused the possibility of purchasing lounge access because the ticket is originally purchased through Singapore rather than Air Canada. So what is the point of flying on Star Alliance partner flights? There is no reasoning with them. ",2nd August 2016,Business,Economy Class,LAX to YYZ,Jul-16,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,95
949,flights were operated to a high standard,D Collard,VerifiedReview,"  Air Canada, Halifax-Toronto-Victoria on 4 July 2016 in economy class. Ticket had been purchased as a Lufthansa ticket through the LH website as a three-part trip: Victoria to Geneva; Geneva to Halifax; and Halifax to Victoria. (The same combination of flights couldn't be found on the AC website.) YHZ-YYZ leg (2h20) was aboard a B767-200 which had started its journey at LHR (and was carrying a number of passengers continuing through from LHR). YYZ-YYJ leg (5h10) was aboard an A320. Both flights were full and operated to a high standard. Good legroom and space for carry-on baggage. FAs passed through the cabin often to offer water or juice. A lot of AVOD offerings, but always preceded by commercials. The worst intrusions of commercials were at the very start of both flights, after the safety briefing, presented not only on all cabin screens but also over the public-address system and on the classical music channels, where from time to time the commercials suddenly blared at more than double the normal volume - forcing you to pull out the ear-buds immediately. Air Canada's food offerings for sale on-board are poor (mostly junk food); but Canadians know that when taking domestic flights they need to eat beforehand. A few days after the flight, an Air Canada agent telephoned to say that an e-reader had been found near my seat on the YYZ-YYJ flight and asked if it might be mine (it wasn't). It was impressive that Air Canada was phoning all passengers seated in that area of the plane to see if it belonged to any of us.

950,crew acted quite professionally,K Nakyoto,VerifiedReview,"  Tokyo Narita to Toronto. The economy seat was so uncomfortable for a 12-hour flight. The first and last meals were acceptable. Six hours into the flight, they served cup noodles and sandwiches. Why cup noodles? The in-flight entertainment system offers poor selections and the route map kept crashing. However, I have no complaints against the flight crew who acted quite professionally.",31st July 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,HND to YYZ,Jul-16,1,4,2,1,4,0,2,96
951,more bearable than not,M Howard,Not Verified,"Air Canada is arguably the best international airline in North America. It's service is somewhat better than the legacy carriers in the US, meaning more pleasant flights. The airport staff at Tokyo Haneda are from fellow Star Alliance partner and Japanese airline ANA, and they are exceptionally friendly. However onboard the plane, the staff are a bit more ""standard"" by North Anerican standards, but compared to US airlines, they are better. Food was edible to say the most, and nothing unusual. Typical Airplane food. The seat is a little thin in my opinion, and I am rather thin. IFE changed from the flight to Tokyo, which was good to see. Airport services in Toronto, however wasn't very enjoyable, but it wasn't Air Canada's fault completely as customs was sluggish. The second flight was delayed due to weather, but it seemed as if there were mechanical problems too. The flight was rather cold, but they gave us a lot of pretzels. Unfortunately, at Dulles, all of us couldn't find our baggage until they brought it out a good hour after our flight arrived at the gate, and it was midnight so it wasn't a busy time.

We arrived at Toronto airport over 2 hours ahead of our boarding time and spent that entire time waiting in line. My husband has difficulties with his hip and I have back issues. The time spent standing in line was both painful and uncomfortable.

953,airline should be avoided,John Mazur,TorontotoClevelandVerifiedReview,"  The worst airline experience of my 56 years of life. The way this airline handles flights, delays and customers in general is almost funny - but it isn't because people's lives are being affected by their dereliction of duty. My flight was delayed for four hours and I must of heard 5 or 6 different stories. The gates were changing, the plane was changing...they didn't have a pilot, they did have pilot. While sitting at the worst terminal I have ever been in, I heard horror stories from other passengers about air Canada. I witnessed 3 other cancelled flights and two other delays.

954,much nicer experience than usual,Irene Fontana-Arnaldi,VerifiedReview,"  Good flight from Frankfurt to Toronto, in what is now the ""old"" business class for Air Canada. This is a business class with full reclining seats. They are a little narrow and rather hard. However, not bad at all. They offer flexible meals and this time this offer worked (sometimes the staff decides that it is not available and as the alternative offered is the same meal but in compact form on a tray with less dishes, we wonder why this would not be available). I enjoyed a lighter meal, when I felt like it. The staff was nicer than usual, and they make a point (this is a new thing) to come by and ask you your opinion about the flight.

Missed our connection and the only option offered is a 13 hour journey to get from Montreal to Las Vegas via Calgary. We looked online and asked if we could just stay the night in Montreal and get on the direct flight to Vegas in the morning (we were originally on a direct flight). Even though you could clearly still buy tickets online they said no, since business class was only thing available on that flight. So instead we now have another connection in Calgary and a 7 hour layover until we can leave on the morning flight from there.

956,dreading the return flight,L James,VerifiedReview," Toronto to Brisbane via Vancouver. Very uncomfortable experience with Air Canada, especially for the long haul. Is it too much to expect on a 13+ hour long flight that there should be some sort of foot rest so that you can get your feet somewhat elevated. Really felt like ""cattle class"". This is the first time I've ended up with swollen ankles after a long flight and I have been flying back and forth to Australia, 3 times a year for the last 4 years. In flight ""entertainment"" was terrible, food was shocking and the washroom was the tiniest thing I have ever seen. Toilet seat didn't even stay up. No amenities provided except for the obligatory hand soap. One snack was offered up inbetween meals and even though the ""menu"" tells you that snacks are available throughout the flight, flight staff made it quite obvious that they won't get you anything. During the shorter flight from Toronto to Vancouver, the snack / meal cart was only stacked with chocolate and chips. Bad luck if you wanted something hot. Clearly these people do not have experience with the truly great airlines like Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Was recommended Air Canada by my travel agent. I'll be letting her know what a terrible choice this was. Pay extra and go with a better airline for long journeys. Really really dreading the return flight.",17th July 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to BNE via YVR,Jul-16,1,2,1,1,2,0,2,96
957,experience overall was pretty dreadful,W Johnson,VerifiedReview," Seoul to Philadelphia via Toronto - this is the route I took with Air Canada, not the route that was ticketed. We were supposed to fly from Seoul (ICN) to Washington IAD via Toronto on a United code share. Our flight from Seoul left late and arrived late, which caused a missed 7:30 connection at Toronto. Our request for 2 vegetarian meals was overlooked on this 13-hour flight. The seats were fine for us because we had a 3-person section and could lift the armrests and lean against each other. The flight would have been pretty uncomfortable next to a stranger for 13 hours because the seats are quite narrow. Also, the flight was about the driest I've ever been on - I left with a very dry mouth. When we spoke with the AC personnel about trying to get back to DC, we were told that there were no flights available to anywhere in the DC area that night, direct or through connections. After AC checked with United about a possible routing that would get us to DC at 2:48 p.m. the next day, it became apparent that the routing was not available either. At this point, we discussed other options and I was told that a 9pm flight to Philadelphia was available. We took it. It was delayed 80 minutes. During this time, I booked a car rental from PHL to drop off in the DC area. By the time we left PHL, it was 1am, and I drove to our house 2 hours away, finally arriving at 3am. I found the flight attendants and entertainment selection to be good generally, but the experience overall was pretty dreadful.",17th July 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ICN to PHL via YYZ,Jul-16,1,4,2,5,1,0,1,96
958,every other airline is a better choice,K Andres,VerifiedReview,"  Avoid Air Canada if you are 1) traveling with kids or 2) you don't want to buy brand new luggage or 3) you want a difficult check-in process. We booked tickets 8 months in advance and they couldn't find 4 seats so my family could sit together. Also, during the beverage service on a previous flight, the beverage cart skipped my kids row and served the adults around them instead. On each leg of our journey, the gate agent complained about our carry-on luggage - specifically that our 22"" carry-ons (aka industry standard) didn't fit in their convenient 21.5"" size requirements. Southwest is 24"", other airlines are similar. I've flow this bag all over Europe and only on Air Canada is it an issue? And then the check-in fiasco. I attempted valiantly to check-in the night before, but that didn't seem to work. Electronic boarding pass options? Nope. So we arrive at the gate and guess what - none of the kiosks work either. I scan 3/4 passports, then the machine decides to quit working. Even discount airlines figured out how to have proper check-in procedures at a fraction of the cost. If you value your sanity, wallet, or are traveling with kids - every other airline is a better choice - stay away from Air Canada.",14th July 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YUL to SFO,Jul-16,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,96

The flight attendant was not pleasant at all. When I got to Toronto from Baltimore, the flight unknowingly was delayed two hours. However, there was nobody at the gate to inform the passengers and we were quite confused what was going on. This delay did not occur on the board until we were supposed to be boarding. So I went to the Air Canada help desk and they were absolutely terrible. I did not raise my voice, but the lady there shooed me away and was extremely rude/unhelpful.

The staff had no finesse at all and the meals were almost inedible. Couples who had been booked for months found themselves sitting rows apart. We accommodated a lady who had booked an aisle seat but was given a window seat only to find that she had so little room that she was almost sitting half in my husbands seat. We had so looked forward to seeing this beautiful country but if that is the best that Canada can do, it leaves a lot to be desired.",9th July 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SYD to YVR,May-16,1,1,1,3,2,0,3,97
961,food was cold and super dry,Natalie P Shay,Not Verified,"Ottawa to Tokyo Haneda via Toronto. The Premium Economy product on the B777 aircraft is much poorer than the B787 we have previously experienced. The service was mediocre - one single flight attendant entirely handling the Premium Economy cabin which results in a slow service and many Premium Economy passengers served after the regular Economy cabin. It makes no sense when you paid for a Premium seat to get served at last. My food was cold and super dry because of the long waiting. I wasn’t even offered any drink while waiting for my meal. The Premium Economy arm rests were all sticky and not even cleaned properly when we boarded the flight. Upon departure, they won’t tag your baggage priority unless you specifically ask them. About 90% of Premium Economy passengers end up with no priority tags on their luggage even though you paid for that service. We weren’t offered a drink (juice or water) upon boarding like before. It took 3 hours for the food service - not worth it Air Canada.",8th July 2016,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,YOW to HND via YYZ,Jul-16,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,97
962,$20 to select a regular seat,M Pearson,VerifiedReview,"  Los Angeles to Toronto with Air Canada. I have never seen an airline so concerned about squeezing money out of their customers. Purchase your ticket online and then pay $20 to select a regular seat - not a special seat, just a regular seat. Every checked bag (even from US to Canada) are charged which means every single flight I saw staff notify travelers that there is too much carry-on luggage and ask who would like to volunteer to have their bags checked at the gate. I have flown a lot of airlines but Air Canada is by far the worst.

No issues with delays however the inflight movie selection is nothing special and the games never seem to work on the last several Air Canada flights I've been on.

The aircraft interior was well appointed with new business class seats that are spacious and comfortable. The IFE is an improvement over the previous version but the content was a let down as the programming had not been updated with the current month's movies. The FA's were very personable and attentive. The main course at dinner was OK at best but the selection of wines made up for it. Bathrooms were bright and kept clean throughout the flight. The flight departed 20 minutes late but arrived ahead of schedule. The Boeing 787 is a magnificent aircraft and well and truly helps reduce jetlag.

Like I have mentioned in my earlier reviews, in terms of schedule and value Air Canada has the best flight options between Amsterdam and Ottawa. However, Air Canada could do more on improving their punctuality as we left Amsterdam an hour later than planned and also the flight from Toronto to Ottawa was delayed, and the food seems to be Air Canada's perennial weakness as it should at least provide better meals in economy couch during long-haul flights.

I understand that these issues do happen periodically with planes but Air Canada originally told us that there was no update, they don't know exactly what is wrong and don't ask about connecting flights.

Kudos to the Concierge service from Ottawa (my base) and Montreal who monitored the status of the flights and planned for contingencies. This service is one of greatest value added of Air Canada for high tier customers. Air Canada uses the old Blue Pod configuration seat on this route. 1-1-1 in Business Class. Seat quite comfortable and allows some sleep for this type of leg (6-8 hours). Seat 1 A on this aircraft does not allow you to have a window (or you have to look behind you). It is a good and comfortable seat nonetheless - close to the washrooms if that's what you are looking for (and if you are not afraid of being bothered by noise from the galleys). Air Canada  Achille's heal continues to be the quality of service onboard. While the young crew members are pleasant, helpful and professional, older crew (particularly YUL-based) tend to be less nice and almost discourteous. This will hopefully get addressed progressively, as crew members are trained or renewed. Good food on board and arrival slightly behind schedule despite a late departure from YUL. Was able to use the FRA Air Canada lounge, the best business class lounge in FRA, by all measures. Staff are nice and helpful. Concierge team in FRA amongst the best. All in all a good experience and a product in constant improvement.",26th June 2016,Business,Business Class,YUL to FRA,Jun-16,4,3,5,3,5,0,5,98
973,good service and good food,Dieter Hannusch,Not Verified,"Air Canada, with 2 days notice, advanced the connecting flight from Toronto to Charlotte/USA by 40 minutes, and without asking us, booked us on a flight for the next day. As requested, I phoned Air Canada in Canada and had to wait 40 minutes on the line for an operator. I asked if Air Canada pays / provides hotel accommodation for the stopover, in line with European Union rules. A very rude female operator then told me that this is not the airline. However, something must have rung the bell in Italy, because the next day a very friendly Italian staff called me from Rome and informed me that I would get free accommodation. The flights from Rome to Toronto and back were very pleasant, with good premium economy seats, good service and good food. Entertainment also had been satisfactory on a big screen (the movie selection could be improved). The only terrible experience, outside Air Canada's control, had been the USA security screening and immigration in Toronto. We had to stand 2 hours in line and, despite being ushered forward twice by friendly airport staff, boarded our plane to Charlotte as last passengers 2 minutes after official departure. Many other passengers lost their connections due to the newly introduced stricter security controls for the US. The return flights to Rome were again very pleasant without any incidents. Toronto airport is very efficient and pleasant. ",24th June 2016,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,FCO to CLT via YYZ,May-16,5,5,4,3,4,0,5,98
974,a very pleasant journey,F Morrison,VerifiedReview,"  Had a very pleasant journey with Air Canada. My route was from Copenhagen to Toronto with the brand new B787-9 and from there to Calgary with an A321-200. Planes were bang on time, the service was good and one flight attendant on the Copenhagen - Toronto flight did even speak Danish. Now that's customer service. On the flight back from Vancouver to London it started so well but the breakfast was a major disapointment. I mean is it too much to serve a normal breakfast on a 10 hour flight? The breakfast was a small cup of yoghurt and a dry cake, packed in plastic, so not fresh in any way. And that was it. Guess most passengers walked straight to a café in Heathrow after arrival. So the fact is this, a great journey with Air Canada were spoilt a bit because of a pretty ridiculous try to save some money.",24th June 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YVR to LHR,Jun-16,3,3,2,4,4,0,2,98
975,I am unimpressed,W Davids,VerifiedReview,"  In a 10 day span I took three flights with Air Canada, none of which were on time. The first two flight were fairly small delays of less than an hour, however on the third flight from Vancouver to Los Angeles we were delayed due to a mechanical error. I understand that these issues do happen periodically with planes but Air Canada originally told us that there was no update, they don't know exactly what is wrong and don't ask about connecting flights. I am unimpressed that Air Canada couldn't get one of my three flights to take off on time.",24th June 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YVR to LAX,Jun-16,2,3,2,5,2,2,2,98
976,rebooked on a flight 22 hours later,Farrel Buchinsky,VerifiedReview,"  Air Canada Express was just downright bad. My inbound flight was delayed 2.5 hours which made me miss a connecting flight. I was rebooked on a flight 22 hours later, delivering me to Europe sleep-deprived. There were plenty of open seats in business class but they would not upgrade for a multiplicity of reasons. On the way back I went to the outhouse that is the part of Pearson airport Air Canada express flies out of- a small cramped prefabricated building with exasperated staff trying in vain to deal with the huddled masses.",21st June 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to PIT,Jun-16,4,3,3,3,1,0,3,98
977,gave us wrong information,H Franklin,VerifiedReview,"  Thunder Bay to Dublin via Newark. Our origin flight was delayed getting into Toronto so we had to run to make the boarding time for our destination flight. Although, we made it to the flight they would not allow us on because our bags did not make it.  We waited 2 hours from 11pm to 1am to get our hotel voucher, and had to wait 24 hours for the next flight. We were not allowed to get our bags. Our hotel was for one night with an 11am checkout, so from 11am to 11pm we had to wait at the airport. We get to our final destination, and one of our bags actually did make it on the original flight so had been waiting for us there, but the other somehow didn't make it on either. We then waited 48 hours to get our second bag delivered to us. So, we were without much of luggage for 72 hours (great way to start a trip in dirty clothes). It was strange how we flew to Dublin on a plane that didn't have any of our baggage on it when the day before we were told the that we weren't allowed to board because our bags wouldn't be travelling with us. Flight back from Dublin via Newark. We had a 3 hour layover which turned into 4.5 hours due to a delay. Then the captain advised that due to a navigation system failure on the plan it will be delayed another 2 hours. Two hours later the captain comes back and says the flight is cancelled. Customer service agents tell us it was cancelled due to weather so no vouchers (weird how the captain had just told us otherwise). We know we missed our connecting flight so asked for hotel (it was 6pm). They make us wait until 11pm to fly Toronto, then, I wait there until 2am to get hotel voucher. We had been traveling since 1am EST. Get back to final destination, and our bags were still in Newark. Again, very odd how they let us on the plane without our bags. All in all we were without our baggage 5 days and had to spend more than 30 hours waiting in multiple airports. The customer service agents gave us wrong information multiple times.

After 4 1/2 hour flight both our backs hurt and continued to do so for 2-3 days. Perhaps the cushions had lost it's form. This plane is good for a couple of hours travel, but not for across Canada. Crew were fine. The gate agent in Ottawa was a miserable fellow. We watched him complain to the female gate agent about work, and he was quick to dismiss passengers who approached him with inquiries. Our return trip to Ottawa was again on a E-190. This time we upgraded to premium seat 16. Much better. No back pains, extra leg room. On board staff were great. Gate agents were friendly. Pilot kept us informed. We even flew at 39,000 feet to miss turbulence from the jet stream.

However, the configuration of the actual plane was completely different. We ended up in a row in the middle of the plane, right before the area where food is stored - the seats there don't recline (row 16). Seat space was extremely tight. Also, the AC website was down for good 5 hours and I couldn't access it to get my boarding passes. The food was bland and just not good (a couscous or bulgur salad, and chicken pasta), I didn't even bother getting breakfast. It amazes me that what we pay for tickets doesn't even get us decent food. The staff was very courteous and friendly, the plane and toilets clean, the plane on time.

I did not expect much from North American airlines, but to my surprise, I'm giving Air Canada a thumbs up for the flight I travelled. Maple Leaf Lounge was adequate, the shower room was clean and the shower was a satisfying one. The food served was superb and definitely comparable to that of a 5 star Carrier. I had a spacious executive pod to myself with lots of legroom. It was comfortable and I had a great 6 hours rest throughout the flight. The food was okay albeit nothing to shout about.  I would say this is on par with many other Asian Carriers. Service crew were attentive and also hospitable.",26th May 2016,Solo Leisure,Business Class,YYZ to NRT,May-16,5,4,5,5,5,0,5,99
982,"unhelpful, callous, rude",Paula Schiller,VerifiedReview,"  Sunday, May 15th. Air Canada flight 7374 from Toronto to Dulles. Traveling with family of 6. My mother became ill on the first leg of our flight from Dublin to Toronto. Was transported via ambulance from Toronto Airport to hospital. My sister rode in the ambulance. I stayed to get bags, and to deal with another unnecessary problem - my 80 year old father, in a wheelchair, and my two sons, aged 21 and 23 were going to go on to Dulles as planned but one of my sons was bumped from the flight. We paid full price in January, we picked seats, checked in, etc. No idea why he was bumped. We go to gate to try to get him on the flight. My father is stressed, my boys needed to assist him, handle luggage, get the 3 of them home, keep him calm, etc. The reps at the gate were unhelpful, callous, rude.  We were vacating seats for the medical emergency, there were clearly seats available, it was a no brainer. Apparantly Air Canada staff can do nothing but look at the computer screen. It took me 2.5 hours at the airport to find someone high enough up the food chain from Air Canada to get my son on the flight and he was put on at the last minute. I should've been with my mother at the hospital but had to deal with this problem that shouldn't have been a problem at all. Also had trouble getting bags off the flight (they pulled the wrong bags twice). They rescheduled us to fly the next afternoon, then bumped my mother to a later flight and notified via email. She couldn't travel on her own. I spent hours trying to reach a customer service rep (no answer - busy signal over and over, then cut off by auto reply machine). When I got a rep he couldn't do anything said we had to go to the airport to deal with it. Finally gave up. Went to United. They were dealt with getting us on a flight, wheelchair service, etc. in less than 30 minutes of time.

I pushed the call button to request an attendant and about ten minutes after no one came I started to time how long it would take to get service - 24 minutes for someone to come to assist me, for that time there was no sign of a flight attendant in the walk ways.  I spoke with the service director about the long delay only to be told that due to the placement of the call buttons on the arm rests that flight attendants can never be sure if a call is legitimate so they allow time for people to cancel the call in case it was made accidentally. I do not know if that is airline policy bit of it is the policy to ignore a call for service I am extremely disappointed. The trash collection on the flight was minimal in that cups and rappers were cluttered for a good bit requiring that tables be left done which minimizes comfort.",24th May 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CPH to YYZ,May-16,2,1,3,5,3,0,4,99
984,legroom in row 18 exceptional,D Martin,Not Verified,"Our return flight from Paris started off on the wrong foot when I tried to check-in online the day before our flight. Although I prepaid for preferred seats at $200 ($100 each), when I tried to check-in we were no longer assigned to these seats, rather we were assigned seats in row 57. When I tried to select preferred seats online it prompted me to pay again. I contacted Air Canada via Twitter and they explained the change was due to an aircraft change, which was wrong as it was a B777ER high density aircraft, which is the type always used on this route. They ended up assigning us to preferred seats 18H/J (rather than 18J/K that I booked), but it was poor customer service that I had to contact them after paying for confirmed seats, and for not being notified of the change in advance. In speaking with the gentlemen in seat 18k, he indicated he was upgraded to the preferred seat for having Super Elite status with AC. Paying passengers should not be bumped for Super Elite passengers. He was a nice man and ended up moving to the middle row which was completely empty, which leads me to wonder why they bumped us out of our seats for him, when there were many other preferred seats available - bad customer service Air Canada. The legroom in row 18 is exceptional, better than Premium Economy actually, which comes in handy considering the lack of width in the 17 inch seats. I usually fly AC, but this has left a bad taste in my mouth. FAs on the return flight were rude and we felt like we were inconveniencing them. During meal service the FA asked if I wanted fish or pasta, and when I asked what the pasta was, she rolled her eyes. The meal was actually delicious (salmon) and we also received a mid-flight snack and small pre-arrival meal consisting of a delicious hot cajun chicken wrap. Beverage service was quite regular.

986,Porter got a whole lot more friendly,S Radine,VerifiedReview,"  I fly with Air Canada extensively throughout Canada. When I first started taking this route (from St. John's to Halifax) they were flying an E90. Which was a lovely plane, lots of luggage space, overhead compartments and space. Since then they have put on a CRA which admittedly was a step down, not to mention a little older - but we made due because it still offered in cabin entertainment and was able to get to and from Halifax in a reasonable period of time. Today, I have been told that in the 2 weeks since my last flight they have downgraded to a Q400 turboprop plane. This plane unlike the last two has nothing, small cabin, small space, no in cabin entertainment and to add more discomfort it will take an additional half hour to make it to its destination. flights to and from Halifax are consistently full, so clearly this is not a space issue. But it is a comfort issue for your loyal passengers. I am not a big fan of Porter as I have always been a loyal Air Canada customer but to be honest when you take away your only ""advantage"" Porter just got a whole lot more friendly.",12th May 2016,Business,Economy Class,YYT to YHZ,May-16,1,3,0,0,2,0,1,99

The 788 seats were quite narrow and hard and overall, passable in terms of comfort. The plane's interior looked ""tired"". Food was served fast but was not properly heated as our water and salad were frozen and not consumable. IFE was decent but did not like the fact that the remote was very small and could not be extended, thank goodness it was also touch screen though. Only plus for AC for NRT-YVR was the ground staff and cabin crew who were all helpful and friendly.

991,downgrading Premium Economy,G Gardeazabal Villegas,VerifiedReview,"  Air Canada is showing some cheap attitude downgrading Premium Economy to just Economy Plus with such bad experience - in just over a year already their Premium economy has been homologated to what their Star Alliance partners Air China and SAS does. Last week flew Vancouver to Tokyo Narita and the service was the same of Economy except for the main course - after that is just the same drinks, the same snack, the same lunch. They keep the divider curtains open between Economy and Economy Plus section, only closed for the main course because it is different. Then flew Beijing to Toronto yesterday and it was even worse. Economy was full with 3-4-3 configuration and Premium Economy was almost empty - people from economy moving to PE (Economy Plus) seating there, the curtain open between economy and Premium economy. Now they have more Business Class seats with the bathroom in the back in economy for Economy and Economy Plus passengers. Never again Air Canada or Air China who have downgraded to a cheap product and charging the same of others whom are offering a much better product.

993,seats are far too narrow,H Cram,VerifiedReview,  London Heathrow to Calgary. Everything that is said by reviewers about the 3x3x3 seat configuration in economy class on the Boeing 787 is true. The seats are far too narrow for comfortable travel. I am an Air Canada frequent flyer and had the front row of economy class on the aisle - travelling with family instead of business for a change. Apart from having to deal with the very cramped middle seat person I was regularly bumped by the FAs and their trolley throughout the flight due to the very narrow aisles. I would rather fly on an older Boeing 777 or A330 then have to suffer this again. To cap it all off the FA gave me a cracked cup which leaked all over my lap. She apparently would have gone to get me some tissues but her colleague was blocking the way - possibly my worst ever flight with Air Canada.,14th April 2016,Business,Economy Class,LHR to YYC,Apr-16,1,1,3,3,4,0,1,100
994,not family friendly,Graeme Brown,VerifiedReview,"  Cramped and not family friendly, are my resounding thoughts. I was travelling with my family, on route from Florida from Toronto to Heathrow, and Air Canada were offering reasonable prices at the time of looking. On booking the flight we requested a bassinet for our baby. We didn't get one despite repeated requests at the airport and on the plane. No attempt was made to accommodate this request. The seats on the plane with capacity for bassinets didn't have babies in them. There were other families with babies that were refused a bassinet. We are frequent fliers and I've never had this issue with an airline before. I was repeatedly hit with the trolleys as the cabin crew made their way up and down the aisles and also by other customers. The issue appears to have been caused by the introduction of an additional seat, so on the 787 the configuration of seating is 3-3-3 in economy. I spoke to the cabin crew about it, as I was unhappy at not being able to get any rest, and on a few occasions when I was holding our baby, his head was also knocked. The cabin crew also expressed their concerns as the reduced width makes their job that much more difficult and that this configuration will be the norm going forward.",11th April 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to LHR,Apr-16,1,2,0,0,2,0,3,100
995,business class luxury is lacking,N Huawei,VerifiedReview,"  Wanted to try the newish Air Canada direct route from Amsterdam to Toronto. The plane was extremely old (probably over 20 years), and it showed in the cabin interior and design. The Business Class cabin was the old herringbone layout 1-2-1. The seat was a bit torn and dirty, again showing how aged the aircraft is. The crew were pleasant enough, and I just happen to meet them prior to the flight as we went through security together. We joked a bit, and they were quite friendly. The onboard service provided by the crew were also good. However, the food was basic, particularly for a flight over 8hrs. There was a hot meal service, portions were small. I had stuffed chicked served with rice, which was preceded by a nice seafood salad, and followed by a cheese platter. The champagne was ly bitter and undrinkable. The orange juice was not fresh but came out of a Minute Maid carton, unbefitting for the highest class Air Canada provides. The pre-landing snack was a very disappointing cold platter of sliced chicken breasts. The water on offer (Naya) didn't exactly reflect luxury. The one thing that appeared luxurious was the amenity kit with Escents toiletries. I would not recommend this for the extremely high price charged for business class. The quality and luxury of business class is simply lacking. The only thing good about it is that it's a direct service.",10th April 2016,Solo Leisure,Business Class,AMS to YYZ,Apr-16,2,4,2,4,3,0,2,100

Boarding was done by zones and doesn't appear to be any more efficient than previous open call crush method. Middle-aged aircraft in reasonable condition, relatively clean, no readily apparent problems. Seat comfort okay and was better than some other aircraft types in the Air Canada fleet. Tray table space adequate. Overhead storage space in high demand with some people having to gate check their carry-on baggage. Underseat storage space okay for smaller items but best to keep this area clear on longer flights (to stretch your legs/feet into). Purchase food available for sale (credit card only) with Aeroplan points offered on purchases meeting minimum threshold dollar amounts.

Complimentary soft drinks, juices, water, tea and coffee available with some alcoholic beverages available for sale (credit card only).

Flight was relatively smooth with little turbulence. No in-flight entertainment available. Snacks and beverages (water or juice) offered on the short flight. Cabin was quieter than most other turboprop aircraft due to the cabin's active noise suppression system, making for a more enjoyable experience. Second flight was delayed several times and finally departed almost an hour and a half late (no Aeroplan points or other compensation offered for the delay). This was an older de Havilland DHC-8-300 series aircraft which was showing its age. Seat space limited/cramped with little padding, no underseat storage and minimal overhead storage space (coat or purse or camera bag or laptop only).

Flight was on a clean, modern Boeing 777 with good leg room and new IFE system. Cabin crew very friendly and attentive. Didn't manage to get a lot in the way of sleep, but that's typical for a 6-hour transatlantic night flight. Only real criticism I'd make of this flight was the breakfast - the meager banana bread doesn't cut it, I'm afraid. The dinner served was quite tasty though.",2nd April 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to LHR,Jun-15,5,4,3,4,4,0,4,101
1001,will not use them in the future,Nick Hagyard,VerifiedReview,"  I'm sorry to say that we are having a terrible experience with AirCanada. After booking our hotels and transfers for our holiday, Air Canada contacted us a few weeks prior to our trip to let us know our flights had been changed to the following day. This led to booking an extra night in a hotel near to Toronto airport. Following this, we have turned up to Toronto airport this morning to find out that our flight from Toronto to Barbados has been delayed by 6 hours. An offering of a $20 food voucher is simply not enough in this situation, monetary compensation would have been appreciated far more. They have a large customer service desk with 5 staff members answering questions, however all they have been asked to do is to tell customers to phone a number or send them an email. They seem unable to take any immediate action. It is now 4.5 hours until our flight leaves, I am not hopeful for our journey home. We will not use them again in the future, despite the more affordable price.",1st April 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to BGI,Apr-16,2,1,2,2,1,1,1,101
1002,food I had was fantastic,Owen Matejka,Not Verified,"Air Canada from Boston to Vancouver via Toronto. Boston to Toronto was a quick hour long flight on the Embraer 190, which is quite pleasant. Quick layover in Toronto and off to Vancouver in a Boeing 777-200ER. The best plane I'd flown in. So smooth and quite, with a great entertainment system. The food I had was fantastic.

1003,very comfortable massage seats,Scott Bruce,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Dubai, and Air Canada investment into new aircraft has paid off on this very long haul route. If you are a Business class passenger you will not be disappointed in this Boeing 787 seat Pod. This is my first Air Canada flight on this new route and I chose to use the last of my upgrade credits and $500 to get a Business seat, I was very glad I did this. I was pleasantly surprised when I got on the flight and it was a new aircraft, usually AC focus's on the Asia Market but maybe they decided that Canada's largest expat community of Dubai might switch back to them vise using the high class and direct flight competitors. Who knows, I was very happy in a luxury pod with very comfortable massage seats and a fantastic Entertainment system. The large screens were amazing but I knocked back a point on the score for the endless commercials you have to go thru with every movie or TV program selected - I normally fast forward, read a book or go to the toilet during this time. Meanwhile in Economy the seats looked nice in Premium Economy but Economy looked a little cramped (Boeing likes to add another seat per row over Airbus so seat width is automatically smaller no matter what configuration is flown). One of the strangest things is that for a flight this long (12+ hrs) that a complimentary toiletry flight pack is not given to economy like the old days - very sad that North American Airlines set the bar lower than Europe and Asia Airline companies. Air Canada advertised the wifi but I did not use it at all, too busy sleeping or watching my big screen TV.",27th March 2016,Solo Leisure,Business Class,YYZ to DXB,Jan-16,5,5,5,4,3,0,4,101
1004,treat their loyal customers better,Scott Bruce,VerifiedReview,"  I was booked on a very tired Air Canada aircraft with poor service from Halifax to Toronto. It started with the booking where, as a Aeroplan Elite Flyer, I was not given a choice of seat selection (which we used to have in the past) so asked for a widow or aisle and got a middle seat. Aircraft was dirty and the only redeeming quality of the flight was the decent entertainment system. However you have to sit thru multiple commercials with every selection, even a 20 minute TV show (so the commercials were almost as long as the program). For over 10 years I have been flying steadily with Air Canada/Aeroplan mostly internationally but domestic as well. I know what AC used to be and what it is today and it is sad that to increase their bottom line they have selected to emulate other reward programs (to the point where their loyalty program is negligible) and service programs (where we are paying more per seat yet getting less in flight services including luggage options). Strange considering that airlines are making record profits. Would I recommend this airline, I answered yes. I would not recommend to any international traveler looking for Elite status as there are other Star Alliance airlines that treat their loyal customers better and allow them to keep their status longer.",27th March 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YHZ to YYZ,Oct-15,2,3,1,2,2,0,2,101

1008,not the best airline,Debbie Herring,Not Verified,"Flew to Vancouver return with Air Canada and not the best airline I have flown with. Cabin crew mature and quite unfriendly. We were sat at the rear of the plane on our outward bound flight and we were told that there was no choice of dish as they had run out. Seating was the usual type in economy, one of our tv screens didn't work, but no less comfortable than any other. Hardly any crew announcements and those that were made were not very audible.

1009,the crew was pleasant,T Eldem,Not Verified,"Montreal to London Heathrow in Business Class. Check in was easy and was assisted by a cheerful agent. Lounge in the international departures area was busy and uncomfortably hot. Following an orderly boarding, the flight pushed back 8 minutes behind schedule due to late arrival of connecting passengers. Once in the air, the service was prompt. Except for one FA who addressed the passengers brusquely, the crew was pleasant and welcoming. The meal was below average in quality with my fish overcooked to the extent it was almost bone dry so I ended up eating the vegetables only. IFE had a good range of new releases. The seating was in the pod style and comfortable with a plush pillow and duvet. Flight arrived ahead of time and bags were already on the carousel by the time I cleared passport formalities. Aside from the disappointing dinner, it was a pleasant experience.",12th March 2016,Business,Business Class,YUL to LHR,Mar-16,4,4,2,3,5,0,3,101
1010,my luggage did not arrive,C Orilall,Not Verified,"Two consecutive trips from Toronto to SF and Air Canada missed my checked luggage both times. We traveled with an infant and so, you can imagine how terrible this entire ordeal was. The first time, they did not deliver the luggage till three days later. The luggage came later on the same day but was not delivered immediately. Instead, Air Canada sends these luggage via domestic two day shipping. So, the luggage was picked up the next day and then makes it way from SF to Oakland and finally to Santa Clara, a total of 3 days later. Customer Service said they try their best to ensure luggage make it on the plane but if it doesnt, they are not liable. I was reluctant to travel Air Canada again but I did and would you believe, for the second time in a row, my luggage did not arrive. I decided to drive back to the airport close to midnight to get my luggage this time (on the next flight that it came on) because of the first experience. I complained and customer service pretty much said sorry and that's it. No reimbursement, no voucher.

History has again repeated itself and our honeymoon has been soured from the minute we arrived at the airport. Our plane has been changed and we are now sitting in the last row, not even together for the 12hr plus flight. When we spoke to Customer Service we got the ever usual response of ""the system is automated, nothing we can do"".

1012,disappointment with Air Canada,M Thompson,Not Verified,"I moved to Sydney from Canada and flew with Air Canada. I had my carry-on luggage approved at the beginning of my trip with the proper tags. On a connecting flight, I was told I would have to check one of my bags at the gate because the plane was full. Once on the plane, I had an entire row to myself and thought it was very strange that I was forced to check a bag onto a plane that was clearly not full. Once I arrived in Sydney, my bag checked at the gate did not come out with the rest of the baggage. I spoke with 5 or more airline reps to try to figure out what happened to my bag over the course of a couple days and received different answers each time. In the beginning my bag was just missing and no one could tell me where it was. If I have been forced to check a bag unnecessarily it should not just ""go missing"". Later in the week I heard varying other stories and eventually realized my bag was just not put on my flight at all. I understand that airlines cannot always fit all baggage, but the least Air Canada could have done in this situation is to track where the bags are in order to avoid unnecessary stress. I eventually got my luggage but had to go through a lot of confusion and stress over it. I was moving across the world and did not need the added stress of a bag being missing. I was also approved by an agent to be reimbursed $100 for missing items after submitting claim with receipts. I submitted a claim to be reimbursed for one of my items missing a month ago and have still not received anything back 3 months later. Upon expressing my disappointment with Air Canada, I was given an apology for the inconvenience and nothing else.",9th March 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YOW to SYD via YYZ,Jan-16,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,102

Gate agent asked me if I could check my bag in as the flight was pretty full. I obliged only to receive my bag in Montreal completely wet. Service was very good for a 50 minute flight; however, due to a lightning storm the plane was held on the tarmac for nearly 1.5 hours. After the alert passed, we stayed on the plane for another hour. The captain was clueless as to why. I wrote Air Canada on facebook and they stated that Montreal Airport had not cleared our plane. Air Canada seems to work fine, it is when they depend on inefficient operators such as YUL when things start going wrong.",7th March 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to YUL,Mar-16,3,5,3,3,2,0,4,102

Smooth Atlantic crossing, tasty food and beverages/wine for free. All seats with individual screens. Nice, helpful flight attendants and good information from cockpit. Seating was fair with decent legroom and comfortable seats.

1017,consistent and good option,F Vedrenne,Not Verified,"Overall a very good experience. Lounge in the domestic terminal of Montreal was excellent. Domestic leg on a long-haul plane coming from Geneva was very good. Lie-flat seats in herringbone configuration. A cold meal and alcoholic beverages were offered for free. Cabin crew was friendly and worked well, but their presentation was unprofessional and terribly groomed. Lounge in Toronto was very good but too crowded during that time of the day: hardly a place to seat. Flight to MEX was on an A319. Cabin crew looked well groomed and service was impecable. Meals were really plentiful and the purser worked around the clock to check everyone had enough. Inflight entertainment was not very good, lucky that there was a movie I wanted to see among the options. Arrival gate was changed, but we deplaned quickly and bags came promptly. Air Canada is a very consistent and good option. Too bad grooming and good presentation is not always seen as important.

The indicator for the washroom was inoperable the entire flight showing both washrooms occupied for the duration. Average food and beverages on both flights. Only one choice of red wine on the domestic portion with the FA blaming it on the heavy consumption on the incoming flight. It is hard to believe they were unable to restock at a major hub like Montreal! The IFE had a good selection but I chose to sleep most of the trip. FA's were very personable on both flights and the service director on the YYZ-GRU leg deserved special mention for her attentive and very personable service.

1021,restore priority check-in,H Jays,Not Verified,"Toronto Pearson to Montreal Trudeau. Check-in procedure at the airport is now a mess, especially for E35k frequent flyers. AC should be ashamed! With the new Business Class check-in for 50k and above, the E25k and E35k flyers are relegated to a single agent in a different part of the check-in area. It's great to enhance service for the business class and the most frequent flyers, but it should not come at the expense of the E25k and E35k flyers. We waited close to 30 minutes for an agent today and came close to missing our flight. Previously I've never waited longer than 10 minutes. Air Canada, if you're reading this, please restore ""priority check-in"" for E25K and E35K flyers. A single agent for a long line of folks does not make for a priority check-in experience.

1022,food was terrible,Jordan Small,Not Verified,"Air Canada, Toronto to Charlotte - the service on the plane was sub-par. The food was terrible.

A fairly long walk to the gate area and the Maple Leaf lounge : comfortable, a warm greeting and a most adequate selection of breakfast food. Boarding was completed early for a 0900 departure but we were then delayed for a minor technical issue which was quickly resolved. Friendly cabin crew served a hot breakfast and subsequently a full lunch : breakfast was not great but the lunch was very good with some good wines available. The herringbone seating is ok - certainly better than BA's product - but I believe AC are improving this on their newer aircraft.

1024,customer service very troublesome,Doug Allan,Not Verified,"Flew from Toronto Montreal. Departure flight was late on take off for an hour because fuel nozzle was frozen (10am). Apparent no quality control but I will give the benefit of the doubt to Air Canada. Return flight, passenger loaded and waited for an hour at the gate for ""head office approval"" for a cowling replacement that had to have been done overnight before going to the gate. Maintenance was checking the cowling measurements at the gate for head office approval. Finally got approval and pushed back. When engine started ""something"" got sucked into the jet blades and damaged them. Suspect maintenance left something on the ledge of the engine. Plane was pulled back to the gate and disembarked after waiting 20 minutes for customer service agent to come to the gate. When we got off the plane their was no customer service agent. Went to customer service desk at Gate 1 from Gate 47 and lined up for one agent. Announced to go to Gate 11A for replacement plane. Lined up near back of line at Gate 11A and waited for 20 minutes then went to investigate. 150 people plus lined up at an empty wicket. Went for dinner in a nearby airport pub and watched people stand there while we ate dinner. Phoned AC and they called back 30 minutes later to advise to use same boarding pass and no need to line up.

1026,a dismal experience,M Hirst,Not Verified,"I flew with Air Canada using Airmiles and it was a dismal experience. On the flight there, the food took 2.5 hours to make its way down the plane - extremely painful as it was right around dinner time. When we arrived in Toronto, the baggage took almost an hour to arrive. On my flight home, they overbooked it (the third flight in a row that they had overbooked that evening). The person at the gate was rude and impatient when explaining the situation to passengers who had paid to be on that flight. In my opinion, it is ridiculous to overbook flights, and it should not be the norm of an airline's practice. The flight attendants were harried and frustrated (understandably), and the airplane took off 25 minutes late. When I arrived in Calgary, the baggage took a long time to arrive again, the belt stopping several times even when bags were on the ramp, making it so passengers could see their bags, but not pick them up until the belt started moving. My two main issues were with the overbooking, and the way the way the gate person addressed people who were trying to find out whether or not they would get on the flight. Reprehensible customer service, I will not be flying with Air Canada any time in the foreseeable future.",18th February 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YYC to YYZ,Feb-16,4,2,2,3,1,0,2,103

1028,very generous legroom,S Griffiths,Not Verified,"Toronto to Vancouver. Air Canada ground staff in YYZ not as friendly as YVR but I guess it is a much busier station. I again paid $60 extra to book a preferred seat. This time it was 13A on Boeing 787. This seat is in the Premium economy cabin. I was made aware of the fact that this was not *Premium Economy* service as Air Canada does not offer that class of service domestically. It is simply a charge to sit in this section of the cabin. It was worth the money for a 4.5 hour flight. The small cabin is very private, with very generous legroom, seat width and comfort. It also means that you are the first to be offered food and beverage service and among the first to deplane at destination. Buy onboard  choices were in my opinion reasonably priced and a very nice selection. Flight attendants attentive yet realised it was an evening flight and many people just wanted to nap. Two trolley services were offered as well as a couple of water runs. Superbowl was being played as we were flying and the flight deck made two announcements to give the score at the end of halftime and the final score. Perfect, rather than making copious announcements every time the score changed. Cabin crew checking the cabin to make sure everyone was looked after, but respecting the fact that many were sleeping. The only observation I had is that the flight was only approx 65% full yet all the seats in the back 10 rows remained empty. Surely the ground staff could have suggested moving some of the pax to even out the space and make more people more comfortable.",9th February 2016,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,YYZ to YVR,Feb-16,5,5,4,5,3,5,5,103
1029,not a great experience,K Chen,Not Verified,"At Toronto airport, even though I had Elite status, the staff didn't make me feel especially welcome or valued customer. I had the opportunity to try out Air Canada's new Premium Economy product on this domestic flight between YYZ and YVR, which required paying a bit extra to be in a special cabin just in front of regular Economy. The seat was not remarkable, except that it has a wider seat pitch and a bit more recline and a footrest. The plane was a Boeing 777, which had 458 seats, and it took a very long time to board the aircraft because there were so many passengers. The crew were doing their job, not particularly friendly or offering service that deserves any mention. On flight was offered drinks twice. The captain (or co-pilot) was attentive though, as we experienced quite a bit of turbulence and he came on several times to assure the passengers.

1030,impressed in all aspects,Simon Griffiths,Not Verified,"Vancouver to Toronto with Air Canada. Very impressed in all aspects of this flight. Online check in easy, proceeded straight to the gate, friendly ground staff in YVR. Flight departed on time, very full but didn't feel crowded. Captain kept us updated through the flight. Paid $60 in advance for a preferred seat 18K which was worth every penny. Tons of legroom. My first time on a 787 and it was very impressive. Excellent features and very quiet. Flight Attendants very well groomed, friendly and efficient. I do find it annoying that on a four hour North American flight on a full service airline that the only food offering is buy onboard. However, having said that the pricing and quality of the items cannot be faulted. I prepaid for a meal and snack voucher for $7 Canadian. For that I choose a Swiss cheese / crackers package which had a very generous offering of cheese with it, and a delicious Montreal smoked meat sandwich on rye with pickles. It would have cost more than that just about anywhere else. Buying it in advance is quite a saving over the listed prices and the flight crew knew I had done so and offered up choices in advance before things ran out. Quite an efficient system for buy onboard. Water was offered regularly on top of the two trolley services which include complimentary coffee / tea / softdrinks. Early arrival in Toronto after a very pleasant flight.",8th February 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YVR to YYZ,Feb-16,4,5,4,5,4,4,3,104

Good selection of excellent food and drinks. FAs very attentive. Seating is herring bone style and seats fold to completely flat position which allows for comfortable sleeping. IFE offering also good with reasonable selection of movies. One complaint though, the WC was not kept clean. This is unacceptable.

1032,sleeping was no problem,Jonathan Hart,Not Verified,"Toronto to Frankfurt on an overnight,  checking in was easy with a separate section for Business, Premium class flyers.  Maple Leaf Lounge was great, many seats and tables, plus free food and drink. On this Boeing 777-300, Business has a 1-2-1 Pod style seats.  I found nothing wrong with them. If it was a bad thing, I couldn't sit beside my wife who I was also on this trip, so I sat behind her on the right side of the plane. To sit kinda beside is taking an isle seat but it's no window seat, plus because the pods are positioned in the pod style, being comfortable in your chair would be hard to chit chat to your traveling partner, so it's down to preference. Food was great, and the drinks were non stop. The bed was 180 degree flat bed and comfortable. There were no PJ's provided like other airlines. I am 6ft 2 and did not find it cramped and sleeping was no problem. I did read reviews in advanced that sitting in the last back seat of each section of Business, provides a bit more storage space, and it was true. So if you book in advanced and select your seat, try for these. But overall, no complaints. The flight was spacious, pods give that cozy effect. There is plenty of plugs and sockets to charge your things. However, non North American travelers, if you need a plug, make sure you have your plug converter.",3rd February 2016,Couple Leisure,Business Class,YYZ to FRA,Aug-15,5,5,5,3,5,0,5,104
1033,retro experience,Chris Rosicus,Not Verified,"Toronto to Frankfurt with Air Canada - extremely slow check-in, unsure why, but neither the computer check-in or the desk layout are intuitive. At the gate - E-71, ground announcements were not intelligible. Onboard is where the retro experience begins. Crew are friendly, service good, but food, ergonomics and entertainment are 1990s - late 20th C at best. The problem is that, for the money one pays, the actual experience is a complete letdown. For same, lower or slightly higher cost, various competitors offer 21st C comfort and care. Poor entertainment, analog quality, reminds me of a VCR. Seats - I am fit and slim, 177cm tall and barely fit. Cannot imagine how taller people, such as most Western Europeans would feel.

1034,IFE on every seat,Aeron Aquino,Not Verified,"I was supposed to fly to Toronto from New York on Westjet but I got stuck in Boston. I booked an Air Canada flight instead and I was very glad I did. Checking in online was easy and I was able to select my preferred seat. At the airport, Air Canada ground crew were friendly, they let me check two bags for free. Boarding was on time and so was the arrival. It was my first time to fly on an Embraer aircraft. I was impressed - I think E-jets have a lot to offer. There was IFE on every seat and the cabin crew were attentive and helpful. Snacks were available and they were tasty. As it was a day flight, I enjoyed the view, especially when we flew over the Niagara falls. I enjoyed the flight and would definitely fly with Air Canada again.",2nd February 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to YYZ,Apr-15,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,104
1035,Leg space is really limited ,Yoko Takemura,Not Verified,"Air Canada's service was, from beginning to end, appalling. On the flight from Tokyo Haneda to NYC via Toronto one of the flight attendants treated passengers as if they were inferior to her. Before takeoff she ordered passengers to close their overhead compartment (isn't this her responsibility?). At one point, there was a lady with a crying baby. This flight attendant told her to put her two large bags up in the compartment in a rude and apathetic manner. The lady was too short to do so, and she was alone, so she had to get a tall passenger next to her to do it for her. On another occasion, she came over and reached over to turn off my reading light without any warning, which I was using to do my knitting. As she reached over, she spilt water on my boyfriend's leg, she apologised and said ""give it 2 minutes and it'll dry."" The two male flight attendants were also rude - when handing out inflight meals, they would stare in silence when passengers were trying to decide what meal to pick and when collecting trays they would just hold out their hands, expecting passengers to hand over your tray as well as other passengers if they were sleeping. On the ground, before take off I politely asked an Air Canada staff member if my boyfriend and I could sit next to each other since our seats were one in front of the other. He seemed overly confident that it was possible and told me he would call my name out. I waited until the last minute, after people started boarding, for him to call my name to find out that he found an aisle seat 9 rows away with no change to the other middle seat we initially had. I understand an aisle seat is great when traveling alone, but this was the opposite of what we wanted - we were now 9 rows away. I told him that that's not what we want, and immediately he snapped, took back the flight ticket, and said, ""if you're not going to appreciate this change I'm giving you back your old seats."" To add, the inflight vegetarian meals were awful, if at all edible. Leg space is really limited compared to Air Canada's smaller, older planes. I would pay more just to avoid Air Canada.",2nd February 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,HND to LGA via YYZ,Jan-16,1,1,1,4,1,0,1,104
1036,food and service very good,Christopher Neep,Not Verified,"Great experience with Air Canada flying from Vancouver to Sydney. Began with an outstanding agent at check in at Vancouver who couldn't have been more helpful with some complexities with our reservations. Not Air Canada's fault. Inflight food and service very good. Dinner, plentiful snacks, and a very decent breakfast all superior to other major airlines I've flown recently. Flight Attendants helpful and attentive, Premium Economy seat very comfortable.

1037,professional cabin crew,T Eldem,Not Verified,"Montreal to São Paulo via Toronto on Air Canada. Smooth check-in and on time performance on all 4 legs. Friendly and professional cabin crew on all flights, especially on the outbound leg between Toronto and São Paulo. Food quality and quantity were decent but the quality of wines offered has deteriorated. The Boeing 767's are really showing their age and AC needs to replace them soon. Lie flat seats offer reasonable comfort but they need better cushioning and back support in the flat position. IFE had good variety for movies and TV shows but audio offering was dismal. Overall it was a good experience although the final leg on the return was cancelled without advance notice and I was not offered the customary Concierge service as a top tier flyer. This meant I had to run around and make alternate arrangements; a blemish to what would otherwise have been a good travel experience. This was particularly disappointing given Toronto is AC's Global Hub. AC needs to either deliver the Concierge service as advertised and promised to its most loyal clients or get rid of it all together to avoid failed expectations.",31st January 2016,Business,Business Class,YUL to GRU via YYZ,Jan-16,3,5,3,3,2,0,3,104
1038,had to pay for food,M Zelcevic,Not Verified,"Toronto to Aruba, and although this was not an Air Canada rouge flight, we had to pay for food (it's a 5 hour flight). Plus you get to pay 25$ per bag. I don't doubt that this was somewhere in the fine print but I was very surprised about it considering the airfare wasn't cheap. Now the main part. FAs were in a bad mood on both flights, border-line unpleasant. When it's a short flight I couldn't care less. When I'm flying for 5 hours with a 2 year old, customer service is more important. Besides, I used my own headphones since AC charges for their own and I had to insert and hold them throughout the whole movie in a specific way so that I could actually hear something. Really? Considering that this is 4th Air Canada flight in a row with identically bad experiences, I will avoid flying Air Canada whenever possible.

We made it as far as Montreal and our flight on the Chicago leg of our trip was cancelled. Air Canada promptly offered us a direct flight from Montreal to LAX which we accepted.

Whilst the economy class leg from London to Toronto was pleasantly served by cabin crew but tiring in economy, we opted on transit at Toronto to pay for business class upgrades to Santiago. What a pleasant experience, and Air Canada ranked very high.  The only downside was that our luggage were not off-loaded and continued on to Buenos Aires so we were delivered one day late.

1042,polite service from the FAs,P Rubenstein,Not Verified,"YUL-YYZ departure did not go well. AC canceled my flight and rebooked me on an earlier flight. This was done with no notice sent to me. The end result is that I nearly missed my flight and managed to make it by running to the gate. To ensure my bag would make the flight, the agent at checking told me to take my bag to oversized. Had I not been traveling at an off peak hour I would have missed my next flight to Taipei and been stuck in YYZ for 2-4 days waiting for room on the next available flight. The cabin was filled with AC personnel, who took up most of the overhead compartment space, making it difficult to find any space. The flight was fine otherwise with polite service from the FAs. YYZ-YUL: Was able to go and standby and to get an earlier flight (which departed late). The connections agent was helpful. At the gate, it was one agent professional and the other miserable and rude. Again, due to off peak travel time, delays and crowding were much better than usual. Flight was full, but FAs maintained a professional approach. As a very welcome surprise, baggage arrived in a timely manner on both flights.  Had it not been for AC's error and the resulting stress and discomfort on the outbound flight I would have rated the flights 8.",15th January 2016,Solo Leisure,Business Class,YUL to YYZ,Jan-16,3,4,1,2,3,0,2,105
1043,supposed to swim to Victoria,Bill Jackson,Not Verified,"Our inbound Lufthansa flight was late leaving Frankfurt and we missed our Air Canada connection to Victoria from Vancouver. We were told that all later flights to Victoria were fully booked and were put in a taxi paid for by Air Canada to the ferry terminal at Tsawwassen. The Air Canada clerk told us to retain the receipt for the purchase of the ferry tickets and then claim the cost from Air Canada. I have tried to do this and Air Canada tell me that we were not authorised to take the ferry so therefore they will not refund the cost. I assume that as Air Canada sent us to the ferry terminal which is obviously by the water, we were supposed to swim to Victoria. All in all, the customer service, or lack thereof, from Air Canada leaves much to be desired. I guess they just think that I will give up and go away. After all I am only trying to claim a lousy 34 CAD. I did try to claim for the four hour delay in reaching my final destination, but we can forget that too. Well, guess what Air Canada?

Bad experience with Air Canada in Montreal, initial flight was delayed 4 hours causing us to miss our connection. We were then advised to speak to customer service to sort out this issue, and after waiting two hours were lied to - the manager in Montreal guaranteed in person that the delay was not weather related and that when we arrived in Chicago we would receive a hotel voucher for the night. We took the late flight out of Montreal and were met with no help at all in Chicago - no voucher, and we were told it was a weather delay by the Air Canada staff so they didn't owe us anything. As a result we spent the night in the airport, waiting for the only available flight at 6am.

1047,she should be commended,Jane Barsanti,Not Verified,I would like to commend the staff who helped me on last nights Air Canada flight AC102 from Vancouver to Toronto. I required a wheelchair on arrival and a lovely young women (3 weeks on the job) pushed me from plane door up to the building and on to a golf chart. I was taken by the cart to near Security and told to wait for another wheelchair to take me thru and down to the luggage pick up. But there was a mix up and no one came to wheelchair me on. I waited for over 10 mins and finally I asked for help and they asked me my flight number. After a few minutes the same girl who had assisted me from the plane took me to luggage and also out to the garage to get to my son's car. She was so wonderful to me. She was quite tiny and I am a large elderly women with severe arthritis. I don't know how she managed to move me up hill so easily and cheerfully. I forget her name but she was such a wonderful guardian angel when I needed it most. Please pass on my thanks and gratitude.

1048,extra money is worth it,Mike Palmer,Not Verified,"First time flying Premium Economy with Air Canada on a Boeing 787. Having used British Airways Premium Economy on the London to Toronto route, I was keen to compare the two. Check in was not at Heathrow as I was hubbing from Germany - the new terminal is great other than the trek to the gate. Priority boarding was quick and easy. On board, the Premium Economy cabin is great - just three rows creating a quiet and intimate environment. A menu was offered along with decent hot towels and juice or water. (in plastic cups) The food was at best average with either cheese pasta of red chicken curry on offer. Neither were my idea of an upgraded meal service. No bar service before a late lunch was offered and so a pre dinner drink was served (when asked) along with the meal. Two T&Cs were offered along with a drink after dinner. The AVOD / entertainment was excellent - probably the highlight! A large screen akin to a tablet with easy navigation. The seat was comfy too though being in the front row meant (bizarrely) that there was no foot stall. The crew were ok - nothing special, but did make an effort to engage. We took off late and landed early so no complaints there. Like BA, the Premium Economy experience morphed into economy for the snack. Another hot towel with the (Economy) hot savory slice merely served on a china plate with two chocolates. There were nice touches using decent glass for drinks, tablecloths on the table etc etc But then odd things such as serving the boarding drink in plastic, poor food choice or a low quality snack on china. All in all, the extra money is worth it to me for the priority boarding, more space and a decent level of service. I think BA has the edge only because the product is more mature. With a bit of tuning Air Canada could really turn it into a quality Premium Economy experience rather than the slightly ill thought out, inconsistent and hit and miss nature of the service.",7th January 2016,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,LHR to YYZ,Jan-16,4,4,3,5,3,0,3,105
1049,failed on multiple occasions,Omar Khan,Not Verified,"Calgary to Los Angeles via Vancouver. I have flown Air Canada multiple times and normally never had bad service, but this experience consisted of a 26-hour hold up in Vancouver International Airport. While the initial delay was due to factors beyond Air Canada's control, our family was then overbooked on multiple flights, transferred to a United Airlines flight, only to be rejected from boarding that flight due to Air Canada not transferring our bag (United Airlines stated that without our bag, they would not let us board the flight due to liability concerns). We then had multiple conversations with various Air Canada employees, one of whom in particular was aggressive and confrontational, telling me at one point that I should consider myself lucky that she was spending her time dealing with me. She also lied to us on multiple occasions. Air Canada eventually offered us a hotel and a flight via Seattle the next morning, and then did a complete about face after we accepted, refusing to honour the offer they made less than an hour before. The reason our bag was not transferred to United Airlines (as we discovered when we went to collect it after the last flight for the day had left from Vancouver Airport without us on board), was that it had already flown to Los Angeles earlier that day. Ironically, we did eventually end up flying from Vancouver to Seattle, and then taking Alaskan Airlines from Seattle to Los Angeles the next day (as Air Canada had offered us shortly after the United Airlines fiasco). I tried to follow this issue up with Air Canada's customer relations department, but unfortunately they failed on multiple occasions to even recognize my concerns adequately (for example, the reply about my concern with not being allowed to board the United Airlines due to lost baggage was to state that the ""aim [of Star Alliance] was to build an airline alliance which would improve the travel experience of customers."" The reply did not address my concern at all after this statement, leaving me rather confused as to what Air Canada was trying to get at.",5th January 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYC to LAX via YVR,Nov-15,3,4,0,0,1,0,2,105
1050,Zoning hampers boarding ,Dagmar Borchardt,Not Verified,"London to Vancouver. Why there is zone boarding no one really knows nor understands as every traveller is confused about when to board. Zoning hampers boarding greatly as it does not consider row numbers only the ticket price as common denominator. Zone 5 by far what most people have is the last, but since row numbers are all over the place there is a long line-up throughout the plane, since row 19 or 40 are boarding at the same time. Food on Air Canada flights is tasteless. Flight attendants on this flight were not helpful when asked for things such as special meals. There were 2 infants in my vicinity who seemingly were not given an extra seat belt for take off. Due to a minor turbulence coffee was not served as it was too bumpy, but cold drinks were.

Toronto to London departing at 6:30pm, online check-in did not work and we had to join the regular queue. My wife and I were not seated together although we booked our seats online next to each other. Air Canada staff worked things out with another passenger so the three of us could be together.  During the flight, they didn't turn the lights out for about 5 hours into the flight citing 'having a full flight and being busy'. The return flight departure was delayed by 1 hour. We were again seated separately and when I asked, their staff suggested we work things out with other fellow passengers. They did the same to another family with an infant and another couple. People were seated away from their travelling partners. They helped only when I continued to insist. Food on both flights was ok.

1052,cabins seem very cramped,Lawrence Cohen,Not Verified,"Toronto to Hong Kong. Air Canada's business cabins seem very cramped. Although you are seated in a pod it's very narrow with limited storage space. Seat is extremely hard with limited padding.  You are provided with a comforter and small pillow. I found the lie flat seat very uncomfortable to sleep on. I cannot understand why these seats are so hard (other than seat padding adds weight). Air Canada seems to have crammed in as many pods into the cabin as possible. Food service was average, basic meal (more like what was provided in economy class years ago). Cabin comfort and food service not at par with Asian airlines but still better than United Airlines. Crew typical Air Canada, efficient, few smiles.

1053,best in North America,G Lin,Not Verified,"Boarding for Toronto to Frankfurt was quite chaotic, as Air Canada overbooked. Some folks had no seats. There were long lines in the small terminal space and everyone was quite disorganised. I was in Zone 2 for boarding but there were many other passengers waiting in the wrong line, obstructing the traffic. The seat was okay, but not very comfortable after sitting in it for too long. I managed to doze off, but the flight attendants kept coming around shouting ""Drinks"", ""Duty free!"" which was annoying. They could have been a bit more discreet and gentle about it. Food was okay, but I have had the same thing many times and the menu has not changed for at least half a year. Breakfast was a joke as we only got a banana bread and a drink. IFE (touch screen) was okay, though I didn't really use it. The flight left on time and arrived early.

1054,2 hours for a beverage refill,D D'Arcy,Not Verified,"First of all it is super silly to complain when you have a seat in the business class cabin. However, considering what I paid for that seat - what is Air Canada even thinking? It seems like they haven’t flown these planes before or have anyone on staff that has even one flight of experience on their resume. It began at check-in in Columbus where no less than 5 agents stood looking at their computers and doing their best to check in two passengers in the span of 35 minutes. I was embarrassed for them and luckily we had arrived early so we weren’t stressed with time constraints. I am on a flight from Toronto to New Delhi, sitting in 3G with the seat all the way back, attempting to balance myself while typing this, sitting up, on a half-way reclined seat. God bless the flight attendants – I just asked one for help to put my seat back to a semi-seated position and she started pressing the buttons on my seat controls and said, “It’s not working? Well, do you want duty free?” The “chair moving system” is apparently turned off for the moment as they “reboot the entertainment system.”  There is no way to put my seat up and one of the flight attendants acknowledged this fact. I tuned in to the inflight programming before takeoff and that was the last time that it actually worked. I was able to begin the “Diary of a Teenage Girl” but that is no longer a choice on the movie selection. This is a 14 hour flight and we are now only able to access 5 movie choices from the New Releases. This was after the crew attempted to reset the service for two hours. The reset apparently takes at least 40 minutes to accomplish but still never works. The service in business class is poor - I waited 2 hours for a beverage refill during dinner and finally I just got up and walked back to the drink station and refilled it myself. My husband and I – since we’re on our honeymoon – asked for champagne. For the first round crew members presented us with a glass but it wasn’t even chilled. I realize in the grand scheme of life and love and loss this matters about as much as a cricket being run over by a car but  the tickets for this part of the plane are expensive and the service/inflight entertainment/food are all awful? Please stand by while I make another useless observation - there were only 14 people in a 32-seat business class area. Less than half of the plane is full in this “service level” and they can’t keep up with drink orders? ",25th December 2015,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Toronto to Delhi,Dec-15,4,1,1,1,2,1,3,106

Aircraft interior was showing its age but all features of the seat functioned well. The cabin crew were cheerful, engaging and very professional on both legs. Food choices were almost the same as with every long haul on Air Canada but quality and quantity were good. Wine selection on the SYD-YVR leg was very good with 3 choices of red and white each. There was a good selection of snacks on both legs. Both flights arrived ahead of time and had regular updates from the flight deck.

1057,frustrating and time consuming,S Lee,Not Verified,"Booked Air Canada return ticket from Vancouver to Osaka under promotion offer of additional 7500 bonus miles. Just about a week before departure, received an email from Air Canada about flight schedule change. Since I wasn't able to match the sudden change, I called Air Canada. Air Canada agent suggested a different route which including over night stay in Osaka airport and stopping over in Korea- Incheon airport. The agent confirmed I will be keeping 7500 Bonus miles as Air Canada is the one who changed the flight schedule significantly at last minute. But the agent didn't want to offer any hotel option for me who had to stay overnight in Kansai Osaka airport. After long argument, agent told me Air Canada will cover the over night stay as long as I stay in one of the airport hotels. After the trip, for long 6 months, I had to constantly call and email Air Canada in order to get the hotel bill refund and 7500 miles. Each time, Air Canada agent promised that I will receive my refund and asked me to simply wait. When it comes to bonus miles, Air Canada agent would simply transfer me to Aeroplan saying it is not their job. In the end, Aeroplan agent organized extra investigation and confirmed that Air Canada is the one who needs to sort out everything as this was special case. Which means I wasted more time by constantly transferred to Aeroplan agents. After more faxing, emails and calls to Air Canada, finally I was able to reach their refund department. At this point, Refund department agent refused to offer neither full refund nor bonus miles. He mentioned I am only eligible for up to $175 per night for hotel stay - I argued that no one informed me about $175, and also I had no choice but booking more expensive room as most of airport hotels were nearly sold out at the time of booking. And my room was one of the very last ones. For bonus miles, he said he will offer me 4000 miles to show me good will!  I was finally able to get 7500 bonus miles and $175 cheque and the rest as air Canada credit for future flight. In the end, I got what I was promised, but it shouldn't have been this difficult, frustrating and time consuming.

Air Canada offers an all-round great flying experience except the food which is was pretty appaling, otherwise the crew offered plenty of drinks during the flight and a tasty wrap towards the end of it.

1059,the worst experience,Dani Lapointe,Not Verified,"My boyfriend and I recently took a flight with Air Canada from Ottawa to Vancouver and had the worst experience we have ever had on a flight. We had arrived at the airport with ample time before our flight, we had already checked in online and prepaid for our suitcase to be checked. All we had to do was print off our boarding passes and check our bag. We waited in line for an atrocious amount of time (there weren’t even many people in line) as Air Canada employees socialized with each other instead of getting people through in a timely fashion. When we finally got up to the counter, they told us we had missed the deadline for baggage check by 2 minutes. The employee were so rude and kept emphasizing that we were late and needed to arrive earlier, use the kiosks instead, etc., as he clearly saw us waiting in line for more than 20 minutes. We checked in our suitcase at a baggage storage unit in the airport overnight instead for $8, and rushed through the airport in order to make it to our flight on time. We got to the gate as they were just finishing boarding our flight. We were about to board when the flight attendants tell us they have no more room for carry-on baggage, and they need to start checking our carry-ons. That alone would have been frustrating enough, but that, added to the fact that we were just denied the ability to check our bag and had rushed around the airport in order to store it, was downright infuriating. Additionally, we did not get beverage service on the flight for 3 hours. My sister went in the next day to pick up our luggage and ship it to us, at a cost of $275.

To say that the flight staff didn't care doesn't paint the picture, distain is a little too strong a word, but only by a hair. It was clear in the demeanor of these staff that they truly hated their jobs. Horrible customer service. The one plus: the pre-flight safety check was digital so we didn't have to interact with these staff any more than necessary.",10th December 2015,Business,Economy Class,YEG to YXY via YVR,Dec-15,2,1,1,4,2,0,2,107
1061,much room for improvement in the product,Vineet Bapat,Not Verified,"My wife and I flew Air Canada from Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver and then back on the same route two weeks later. Prior to the flight, I was a bit concerned about the quality of service we would get compared to Qantas and Air New Zealand, which we have flown before. The crew (flight deck and flight attendants) on both legs was actually quite good - responsive and polite. We had a slight delay due to a minor technical malfunction leaving Sydney, and the captain kept us well informed. I appreciated the frequent ""water runs"" by flight attendants throughout the flight - important to keep hydrated during those 14 hours. However, there are definitely things that Air Canada could enhance for this sector: Toronto passengers flying to Sydney have an awkward flight transformation whereby they are on a domestic flight up to Vancouver with North American service standards for food. They are entitled to free food because they are flying as international passengers, however, we had to inform or alert the flight attendants of our status (although we found out they already had this information!), which was awkward to do, particularly if your seatmate was a domestic passenger flying only to Vancouver. Would it be too much to ask if international passengers could be treated the same as those with special meal requests, who are served discretely prior to the regular meal service - On the way back, we had to clear customs in Vancouver, collect our baggage and then put it on the luggage belt for the continuing flight to Toronto. There is a long walk from customs to where the bags are put on the belt. The most disconcerting thing about this was that we barely had time to use the washroom before having to immediately line up to board the flight to Toronto - this was unlike the much more contained but efficient process on the way to Sydney, where we deplaned and then reboarded in the same general area. The quality of the food on the Vancouver-Sydney sector was average at best - bland but adequate. Breakfast included a hardened omelette which was barely edible. Food on the Sydney to Vancouver sector (same meals - chicken with vegetables or beef with rice) were tastier - we attributed that to Australian (vs. Canadian) catering. AVOD was again very lacklustre - older movies and nothing very appealing, music selections were average - used to be XM radio, now Stingray, small old screens - mine had a crack on the way back So no major complaints but there is much room for improvement in the product.",10th December 2015,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Sydney,Dec-15,3,4,3,3,4,0,3,107
1062,uncomfortable Boeing 787,Anthony Chapman,Not Verified,"Just completed a 2-week tour of Rajasthan in India. Flew from Nova Scotia to Udaipur and back. Half of the connecting flights were Air Canada and half with Jet Airways, an Indian carrier. As always, cabin service is better on Asian airlines. But Air Canada has newer aircraft and outstanding flight deck crews who fear no weather. So I was looking forward to a homeward leg from Dubai to Toronto on AC057, which is serviced by new Boeing 787. What a disappointment! I am 6 ft tall and weight about 200 lbs. The lady on my left side was a small, wider person. We could not fit our shoulders across the seat back space provided, so it was a very uncomfortable 14 hours on this non-stop leg. Connected in Toronto to a small Airbus flying to Halifax. Much more leg room and shoulder room. Air Canada, please pay attention to this complaint.",7th December 2015,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DBX to YYZ,Nov-15,1,2,3,5,4,0,4,107
1063,very attentive service,A Tang,Not Verified,"Flew Toronto to Tokyo Haneda with Air Canada. Trip began with a smooth check-in - Air Canada has a whole dedicated priority check-in aisle at Toronto Pearson for eligible travellers. Only criticism was the agent gave inaccurate information - was told I did not have to retrieve checked luggage at Haneda airport for my connecting flight, but turned out all connecting passengers had to pick up luggage there for immigration. The B77L aircraft had the original two-cabin configuration, with decent entertainment options. Meal choices consisted of Canadian as well as Japanese fare. Very attentive service by the cabin crew, who approached each passenger to find out their needs in between meal services. Mid-flight snack was good too even though portion was small. In general, an excellent flight experience.",6th December 2015,Solo Leisure,Business Class,YYZ to HND,Nov-15,4,5,5,4,3,0,4,107
1064,good flight in Boeing 787,Paul Smith,Not Verified,Had a good flight in this new Boeing 787. The lower pressurization makes a real difference in the overall comfort level. The seat arrangements have plenty of room. Seats are more comfortable than those of the Boeing 777 business class pods. The large screen was a real bonus. My major complaint is with the food. Air Canada must improve the look and quality of the food they serve in business class. As for the level of service the flight attendants were excellent.,6th December 2015,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Vancouver to Toronto,Dec-15,4,5,3,4,3,0,4,107
1065,do not seem to care,B Yamamoto,Not Verified,"I had flown to Vancouver for a medical conference and was booked to fly home (Toronto) from Vancouver on AC 180 on November 29 and had taken time to grab an aisle seat 24 hrs earlier with online pre checkin, so had a seat on this flight , when found out the flight had been cancelled only 4 hrs before departure. Curiously there was another Air Canada flight scheduled at the same time for departure but was told the plane was fully booked. I did notice at the time of checking in the plane was clearly not fully booked (AC 180). The only way to get home was through Montreal which added an additional 3 hours to the flight. How they can cancel a routine route flight full of people and and sub in a plane that obviously had smaller capacity and not able to take all of the booked passengers, re-routing them instead, is beyond belief. The agent did not seem to feel that this was in any way unreasonable even though I had a booked seat on the cancelled flight. So a 5 hour flight turned into an 8 hour flight which would not have been too bad other than it took another 2 hrs to get to the gate in Toronto and get my bag (1hr 15 mins of waiting for the bag). It took over 10 hrs for a flight that I have taken forty or more times before with no problem for 5 hrs. I have flown to and from Vancouver to Toronto for 25 yrs or more often twice yearly and usually on Air Canada's main competitor and have never been bumped from a flight and never waited 75 mins for my bags. I thought I would try Air Canada this time and discovered why so many travellers express negative reviews. Air Canada do not seem to care about service or the traveller. I would strongly recommend if there is an alternative to choose a different airline.",4th December 2015,Business,Economy Class,YVR to YYZ via YUL,Nov-15,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,107

1068,a nightmare of a travel day,W Burns,Not Verified,Our Air Canada flight was cancelled and the checkin desk was understaffed. When we were told we would have to wait for 7 hours for the next available flight all they gave us for compensation was a $10 meal voucher. We are flying with a 2-year old and now in for a nightmare of a travel day. Absolutely ridiculous given it is only an 1.5 hour flight.

1069,the worst refund policy,M Fairlie,Not Verified,"Upon arriving in Los Angeles from Australia we received a message that my father had passed away, we then made alteration's to our trip to return home. Upon returning to Australia we have made attempts to redo our trip. Air Canada has the worst refund policy out, for us to rebook our flights through them it will cost us another $200. 00 each.

1070,terrible credit voucher policies,B Braun,Not Verified,"Air Canada has terrible credit voucher policies. Beware when booking a ticket. In error I booked a ticket with a route error. The rules and fees to change the ticket equaled the same amount as rebooking it. Note the following: There is a change fee for each direction ($75 each direction), a name change fee ($100) and if the new ticket is less than the original ticket the difference is forfeited. Also note that a credit is good for one year from the date of booking, not the date of the flight on the actual ticket. So, basically count any short haul ticket as a write-off if you need to change it.",24th November 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Edmonton,Nov-15,3,3,0,0,3,0,1,108
1071,volume and length of delays,Sarah Wolfe,Not Verified,"I am not one to usually write a negative review, however my last 3 experiences with Air Canada have been very disappointing. My partner and I have flown to Phoenix, St Lucia, and NYC all within the last year. We have not had one vacation without a significant delay on either the departure, arrival, or both. Tonight we were delayed by 6 hours. The delays, such as this evening, have been due to mechanical issues. I can appreciate valuing everyone's safety, however the volume and length of delays has forced us to view Air Canada as unreliable. We have missed out on nights of hard-earned vacations, and even worse, time spent with family. A few food vouchers for airport food, at airport food prices is simply not sufficient for the repeated inconvenience and frustration we have experienced. Air Canada has told us on many occasions that they appreciate our business, however they have certainly missed opportunities to show us. We will be reluctant to use or recommend Air Canada again - we require a company we can trust and rely on.",23rd November 2015,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to LGA,Nov-15,3,2,1,4,3,4,1,108
1072,service was average,Paul Shardlow,Not Verified,"Flew London to Vancouver return. I booked row 18 which is the first row of economy cabin, after premium economy. The leg room was great, more than I expected, but configuration is 3x4x3 so seats are narrow. I thought the service was average but I have never had such poor food on a long haul flight before. The main course on the way out was disgusting, snack before landing was edible.  On the return flight, the food was just as bad, and the snack before landing was yoghurt and a piece of banana bread.  The service was basic, one drinks round before dinner and drinks offered again with the meal and snack. Water was offered throughout the flight every 2 hours or so.

1073,flights were pretty good,Jaelle Doth,Not Verified,"We flew Air Canada from Ottawa to Dubai via Toronto. We were two adults and a 5 month old baby. We paid extra for the bulkhead seats so we could have a bassinet for the baby. The extra leg space and the bassinet was truly a must for our 13 hours long flight. Overall, the flights were pretty good. We had a great price, the service on board was good (although I would of preferred to have at least one of the adults meal served with all the other special meal delivery as it is impossible for both adult to eat while attending to an infant) and the inflight entertainment was bad from Toronto to Dubai which contributed to making a long flight even longer. However, the selection was better on the flight from Ottawa to Toronto!? The meals were ok, but we were served a turkey sandwich which was horrible. I have flown with KLM and Lufthansa for similar trips to the Middle East and they seem to serve more food, bigger portions and great quality meals.",15th November 2015,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YOW to DXB via YYZ,Nov-15,3,4,2,2,4,0,5,108
1074,Boeing 787 is quite comfortable,Charles Hui,Not Verified,"The business class cabin in this Air Canada Boeing 787 is quite comfortable. In fact this is the first time that I am able sleep on an airplane upon 30+ years of flying experience! The biggest complaint I have with Air Canada is the quality of food, which was poor. The printed menu offered a few choices, but end up with no choice after all for reasons that I didn't bother asking. I chose Japanese meal which turned out to be quite salty. I recommend this airline only because of this newer Boeing 787. The 777-300 which I flew before from Vancouver to Hong Kong was terrible which I would not recommend.",15th November 2015,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo to Vancouver,Oct-15,4,3,1,3,4,0,3,108
1075,overall a good experience,T Eldem,Not Verified,"Sydney to Vancouver, check-in was quick and easy. Air Canada uses the Air New Zealand lounge in Sydney which was well appointed with plenty to offer. Boarding well managed and the flight left on time. Onboard the seating was the herringbone style sleeper pods. The seat was comfortable in all positions but not so in the lie-flat mode causing lower back pain. Amenity kit was basic. Dinner and brunch were tasty and the red wines offered were good. There were frequent water runs and one FA in particular regularly walked around asking if I needed a snack or something else to drink. IFE had good selection but the sound quality remains an issue on AC systems. Toilets were kept relatively clean but they could have used more attention. The flight arrived on time but luggage delivery was slow. Overall a good experience.",14th November 2015,Business,Business Class,SYD to YVR,Nov-15,3,4,3,3,4,0,2,108
1076,refused to issue a refund,Nicholas van Nostrand,Not Verified,"I purchased a seat upgrade for $1200 at check in. The entertainment system in my seat was not working, neither was the AC outlet. I asked the flight attendant if there were other empty seats that I could move to but it was a full flight. No entertainment or the ability to plug in and charge my own iPad. Flight attendant suggested contacting customer service to request a refund for the upgrade. Contacted AC customer service via e-mail. Waiting 16 days for a response and they refused to issue a refund on the upgrade, but offered a $110 travel voucher. I e-mailed back to say that was unacceptable and asked to be put in contact with a supervisor or someone who could escalate my concern. 18 days later they contact me and said there was nothing else they could do, and that they considered the matter closed and to have a nice day.

1077,terrible experience booking,Abi Mannarn,Not Verified,"Haven't managed to fly with them yet - but had a terrible experience booking my flight. Was charged for the flights and everything was good to go, got the confirmation through and was really excited. Then my account got charged a 2nd time for the flights - an extra $1,200 was taken out of my account. This lead to my bank blocking the card because it put me in negative $1000. After calling Air Canada help desk to find out what had happened, I was told that it was a technical glitch and the money would be released in 7 days and there was nothing that could be done to help. Basically I have been left with no money, a blocked card, and no way to access anything for the next 7 days. Spoke to 2 customer service reps and asked for a supervisor but was told there wasn’t one available. Unbelievably disappointed in these antics and can honestly say I will never be using Air Canada again. Broke for the next 7 days and borrowing money off friends because of a technical error on their end and zero help offered by customer service.

1078,double check your seats,Ingelise MacDonald,Not Verified,"Trying to book seats or have a family seated together was frustrating and only partially successful. My daughter, so inlay and infant grandson flew from the east coast to the west coast in October. Two short flights and one longer one. They booked and paid for seats on the long flight. Checking in 24 hours in advance, they saw the seats they had purchased had been changed and they were seated apart on all 3 flights. A call to Air Canada corrected the problem, they thought. The morning of the trip they checked online and they had been moved apart on all three flights. A complaint on Twitter got Air Canada's attention and in discussion with an agent they were able to be seated together on two of the flights, but the third one was full so they were now at opposite ends of the plane. They were not able to get the seats they had originally paid for. Now unsure of the competence of the staff, we went to the airport early and the seats had been changed again! How is this possible? They were reassigned together on the flight they had paid for their seats. They were moved together into the last two seats together on one of the short flights but they were apart on the other short flight. This is inexcusable. Who wants to travel alone with an infant?

1081,service was even more strained,Colin Hamilton,Not Verified,"Outward flight with Air Canada was very comfortable as the cabin was only about 80% full but service and food was the poorest we have experienced in 40 years of flying. The flight crew could not do much about the food but the service or lack of it is something that Air Canada needs to sort out asap. All the staff looked like they would have preferred to have been somewhere else. The entertainment system was very basic and the headphones did not work very well. The return flight was full and naturally the service was even more strained, cold food after a long wait and no choice. One beer and one coffee on a 15 hour flight will not have me booking anymore trips with Air Canada.

1082,economy class seat was good,Bobby Giannakopoulos,Not Verified,"I've taken Air Canada on YUL-YYZ-YUL route. The inbound plane was an A320 and the return flight an A330 continuing to Geneva. Check in at the kiosks in Montreal and Toronto airport was easy and user friendly.  I had a booking in economy class but I got upgraded in business class on the return leg. The seat in economy class was good, the front rows have more legroom for a purchase in general. The service and the cabin crew on board was also good, despite some turbulence on the return leg. Buisness class seat was amazing you can adjust and incline the seat how you like it and there's a massage button. You get a drink prior to take off and a complimentary snack which was a cheese plate with a choice of alcoholic drinks. Overall Air Canada offers a good product and you can see the staff enthusiasm. I would travel again in Business class on Air Canada if I get another chance.",1st November 2015,Solo Leisure,Business Class,YUL to YYZ,Oct-15,5,5,4,4,5,3,5,109
1083,a downgraded experience,A Victor,Not Verified,"Unfortunately, I will never fly Air Canada again as long as I can help it. Living in Hawaii requires a long flight to any designation outside the island chain. I have flown Hawaiian mostly to California destinations and have never been sorry about that choice. I always slept comfortably on red eye flights. However, I was in pain and shifting constantly en route to Los Angeles on the first leg of journey because seating was too close. I am only 5'6 and about 125 lbs so it should not be a problem. I couldn't sleep at all. Then, in Los Angeles, as we were boarding a empty plane that was not even close to being sold out, we were stopped by a flight attendant who lifted both our regulation size carry ons. She smugly said, ""if this wasn't a full flight we couldn't let this bag on."" Um, why bother singling us out? Why bother even mentioning it? It was wholly irrelevant. She was just rude. When we got to Toronto, we were in more pain and really uncomfortable because we were on the same aircraft type as the flight across the pacific (two rows of 3 seats, narrow body). The Air Canada folks were really unfriendly and downright couldn't be bothered throughout our traveling. It wasn't isolated. After a 6 hour layover at Toronto, we discovered we weren't seated next to one another on our 10 hour flight to Munich. We tried to get them changed and they were (sort of) but then they messed that up and the double booked our seats. So when we got on the plane we didn't have any seats. The kicker is that I went to ask a question of a flight attendant she pretty much ripped my head off and was extremely confrontational. All I wanted was her to tell the other flight attendant an important piece of info while they were sorting out the seat issue. Our flight to Munich on the brand new airbus was amazing. If you have a chance to fly the dream plane do, but the crew were still unfriendly. When we flew home we flew with Lufthansa and it was great. Back on Air Canada from Vancouver, BC to Hawaii - awful. The flight attendants were dressed in cheap looking uniforms. They left the lights on almost the entire time so we couldn't sleep (night flight) and they kept the air on the entire time. Everyone around us froze. There was no TV, music, or any entertainment at all. They told us we needed to download an app after we were on plane where there is no internet. I don't care I wanted to sleep anyway, but it was definitely a downgraded experience. I don't usually care about the fitness of the plane as long as it gets me to my destination, but this one was run down completely with holes in the carpet. Never again.",30th October 2015,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hawaii to Munich via Toronto,Oct-15,1,2,2,0,2,0,2,109
1084,seats fairly comfortable,Zachary Spooner,Not Verified,"We were flying from London to Toronto and Air Canada service turned to be quite good. food was desirable and edible, a lot of beverage offerings, friendly staff.

1085,legroom was more than sufficient,S Neuhauser,Not Verified,"Red eye flight from Vancouver to Toronto was on time. As I was aware that Air Canada's Y-class on this particular aircraft and route is extremely cramped, I booked a ""preferred seat"" at the front. This cost an extra 60 CAD but was more than worth it: These seats are used as ""premium economy"" seats on international flights on this particular B777. Legroom was more than sufficient, as was the seat width. Catering is not complementary, and can only be purchased via credit card - no cash. I don't think that is a good policy as not all credit cards are accepted by Air Canada, at least mine wasn't (my Hotel did, as did the grocer beside the Hotel...). But it is possible to book a meal online ahead of your flight which I did on my way back. This worked just fine and I recommend this service as you pay less than on the aircraft. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Recommended (but don't forget to book that ""preferred seat""!).",27th October 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Toronto,Oct-15,4,5,3,5,5,0,5,109
1086,contrasting flights out and back,Steve Parkin,Not Verified,"Contrasting flights out and back. Going out Heathrow to Vancouver, the plane was packed and it felt packed. People seem to be let on with cabin bags as big as my main case (it's not only Air Canada who let them get away with it). As a result, the lockers were full, meaning having to squish bags under the seat in front. The result is a real squeeze. We spoke to the crew, and they said AC have removed a galley and set of toilets so they can squeeze in more seats. This makes meal-heating arduous for them and conditions cramped. We were actually dreading the return trip, but it was far less packed, and there was a good 6"" extra leg-room. It really makes a difference. I know airlines have to maximise profit, but if they get known as the airline with cramped seats, people will steer clear. On the way out, my entertainment system didn't work, except to show a map. No films, TV, music. On the way back, it all worked. Food going out was OK at best, with the last part being a wrap which dribbled all over my top. Probably my own fault for not knowing how to eat. Food coming back was excellent, really liked it. I'm glad to have had both trips. Sometimes things go well, sometimes not. The crew going out were nice, and clearly stressed because we weren't the only ones feeling crammed in. Coming back, with just that bit more room, the whole atmosphere was so much more relaxed.",26th October 2015,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to YVR,Oct-15,2,4,3,3,3,1,3,109
1087,"ridiculously tight and uncomfortable,",Siobhan-Louise O'Keefe,Not Verified,"As my Vancouver to Montreal flight was ridiculously tight and uncomfortable,  I enquired whether any seats were available in premium and how much it might cost. My return flight was better comfort, if still tight, the price was reasonable so we upgraded. Unfortunately, the cost varies wildly from flight to flight so we were unable to book same for return flight (cost was more than double). We were thrilled with the attention on board. the seats were spacious and it made our trip a pleasant experience. The flight attendant was particularly wonderful. One point, the pilots seem to always be in the bathroom everytime I wanted to use it, and for long periods, which was odd.

1089,Air Canada cancelled my flight,Richard Millard,Not Verified,"The first leg of my journey was fairly uneventful from YVR-YYZ. There was a delay disembarking due to a stated lack of equipment at the gate at YYZ, similar to a problem I had encountered recently on a previous journey. It is appealing to travel domestically on a twin-aisle plane. But the IFE has more limited offerings than were previously available, so bring plenty to read. Travel on the short YYZ-ROC is almost always a nightmare. I was determined not to be fooled again, and had already lined up a rental car to drive instead - knowing that the average delay has been running well over an hour and I'd easily get there sooner by car. Up until less than an hour before boarding the flight was shown on time (despite the arriving equipment being shown as not getting in until well after the posted departure time). Foolishly I cancelled the rental car, and of course Air Canada cancelled my flight. The customer service desk was 4 empty seats, no staff, but their garments left on the chairs. I'm stupified by how badly this airline works.",23rd October 2015,Business,Economy Class,YVR to ROC via YYZ,Oct-15,1,2,0,2,1,0,1,109
1090,impressed with 787 business class,Andy Lam,Not Verified,"We flew the new Air Canada Boeing 787 with totally redesigned business class seats. I loved it! What a big difference over the last version. My friends used to complain sleeping in the old business class seat was like being in a coffin! Not now - there is more room and the seat is comfy and not too firm. The lie flat seat is now much easier to control with the touch pad screen, and in the sleeping position there is lots more leg room too. Each person is in a private pod, and the whole product has been so well designed and thought out. The TV screen is large and razor sharp, and the BOSE noise cancelling headphones are wonderful. You will also have fun with the new light sensitive windows which do not require a shade. They have a new food menu in business class. I am not a fan of airline food and don't drink any alcohol and so I am not a good person to comment on this. Overall I am impressed with the new 787 business class on Air Canada.",22nd October 2015,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Milan to Toronto,Oct-15,5,5,3,5,4,0,4,110
1091,delayed by six hours,Jonathan Novak,Not Verified,"This trip involved Air Canada flights from San Diego to Kingston, Ontario, via Toronto Pearson Airport. The connecting flight from Toronto to Kingston was delayed by six hours, and instead of reaching my destination shortly before 9pm as I had planned, I got in shortly before 3am the next morning. Air Canada issued all passengers a paper slip with information on claiming a 10% off next trip voucher. When I went to the website to claim my voucher, I was unable to do so, as the webpage insisted that my first name didn't match the first name on the original ticket, which is of course false. I then called customer service, and spoke with someone who had absolutely no idea how to resolve this issue. So, the 10% off voucher is completely useless. I fly frequently for work, and I can safely and accurately say that Air Canada is the worst airline I have flown in the recent past.

1092,has gone downhill,Phil Robinson,Not Verified,"No meal for this Air Canada international flight after Vancouver, had to pay. On return from Vancouver, breakfast was not served until 1 hour from landing in Sydney, we were starving. Seat comfort was horrific, and padding completely worn out. Terrible ground service at airport arrival. No assistance to help with missed flight from Sydney to Brisbane due to maintenance delay in Vancouver. Air Canada has gone downhill.

1093,Air Canada still cares,T Eldem,Not Verified,"Montreal to São Paulo via Toronto with Air Canada. Smooth check-in assisted by two very pleasant agents. First leg was on a tired looking aircraft but service from the Flight Service Director was fabulous. Service consisted of snacks and beverages as this was a short jump. Flight left and arrived on time. Second leg was delayed by almost 2 hours and was on an even more tired looking Boeing 67. It is time Air Canada replaced these vintage birds. As it was a late night departure I skipped dinner went to sleep right away. I got a good rest on the fully flat pods and woke up in time for breakfast. The service was good and the meal was of reasonable quality. Washrooms was another piece of proof of the aircraft's age but they were kept relatively clean. Upon arrival, I was met at the door of the aircraft by the Concierge who advised me of what I had to do to make it to my connection assuring me I was secured on the flight despite the late arrival of the inbound flight. I must say this was much appreciated and went a long way in convincing me Air Canada still cares.",18th October 2015,Business,Business Class,YUL to GRU via YYZ,Oct-15,3,4,3,3,5,0,2,110
1094,seat was very uncomfortable,W Pollitt,Not Verified,"Lots of nagging problems. Late Air Canada departure (40 min) from Toronto to Shanghai, only compounded by an even later arrival (85 min) to Shanghai. Paid for an exit seat that was very uncomfortable. Cushion material was bunched and broken down. One of the most uncomfortable seats I have been in. Food is terrible, some not edible. Return flight was better, but still would not recommend.

Its nice and big, but doesn't seem to have a lot of food and drink to choose from. Friendly staff, and it was clean. The plane was clean and comfortable. We had excellent service from our flight attendant, who smiled and welcomed everyone on board, and service inflight was very good. The food was delicious.

1096,Inflight entertainment the worst,Peter Spence,Not Verified,"On the outward flight, Heathrow to Vancouver, we were unimpressed by friendliness of cabin crew. They seemed to have no interest in offering a positive customer experience, and viewed passengers as an inconvenience. The meal on departure was vegetarian, as they had run out of the meat option. There were no apologies, and the food was horrible. The meal prior to landing was a wrap and was tasteless. The return flight had a different crew but the same attitude. Again they ran out of the meat option so could only have vegetarian. When I asked who to complain to I was given a business card at the end of the flight. Clearly the head of the cabin crew was too important to talk to passengers. The breakfast prior to landing was a yoghurt, slice of banana bread and a small cup of coffee. Inflight entertainment the worst I have seen in years. ",14th October 2015,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Heathrow,Oct-15,1,1,1,1,2,0,3,110
1097,A321 business class is poor,Clifton van Putten,Not Verified,"We were rebooked on the Air Canada redeye from San Francisco to Toronto after the United Airlines connector was delayed 4 hours, thus causing us to miss our original daytime flight. There is no Air Canada service desk at SFO behind security, so we were fortunate to find an active departure gate with an Air Canada agent who helped us confirm our rescheduled flight arrangements for later that evening. United were unable to issue the onward boarding passes at our origin city on the rescheduled Air Canada flights, so it is a good thing we found an agent willing to help us. If we had showed at the gate for the flight that night with no boarding passes, we would have likely been out of luck because initially, Air Canada could not find our tickets! United had made a mistake in the rebooking, so it took numerous calls from the Air Canada agent to United to find them and reissue our boarding passes. When this was finally accomplished, we decided to purchase an upgrade to business class since we wanted to get some sleep on the overnight flight. Mistake! The product on the A321 in business class is poor, with poorly padded seats, and a miserable level of decline. Didn't sleep more than a few minutes at a time, as doing so caused my head to flop around like a bobble head doll when I began to doze off. Overall, business class was a waste of money. Though the ground service crew in San Francisco were unfailingly polite and accomodating, we should have just remained in coach as we were originally booked. No doubt it would have been a miserable flight in terms of comfort level, albeit at a fraction of the price we ended up paying.",13th October 2015,Couple Leisure,Business Class,SFO to YYZ,Oct-15,2,3,1,1,5,1,1,110
1098,customer support on ground poor,Hani Henein,Not Verified,"Air Canada cancelled a flight and did not rebook passenger for the most convenient return, but had to wait 5 hrs at Columbus terminal for the rebooked section. THis airport has no Air Canada rep. One has to call Toronto and wait over 15 minutes for an agent while having to listen to Air Canada advertising.  I felt I was a hostage. My last three flights before this also had issues. That was with luggage and cancelled flights. Level of info is confusing and different depending who you talk to. Level of Air Canada customer support on the ground is poor.",8th October 2015,Business,Economy Class,YEG to CMH via YYZ ,Sep-15,2,1,1,2,2,0,2,110
1099,disappointed with experience,N Fonseka,Not Verified,"London Heathrow to Vancouver with Air Canada. The flight attendants did not respond well to the fact that the flight was almost full, yelling ""the flight is full"" as they reluctantly helped passengers with their cabin baggage (how this was our fault was beyond me).  The IFE system had limited choices, and my seat (last row of the cabin) was very uncomfortable as it had a very marginal recline. However, the meals were above average. My starting point had been Edinburgh that morning, and unfortunately my suitcase missed the connection and did not make the flight from London to Vancouver. While this wasn't the fault of Air Canada, almost four weeks later I am still waiting for a baggage irregularity report from them to submit to my travel insurance company (despite requesting this in a phone call and by email). Overall, feel disappointed with the experience.",7th October 2015,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to YVR,Sep-15,1,2,4,2,2,0,3,110
1100,a good value for money,Ludwik Zabłocki,Not Verified,"Geneva to Toronto via Montreal, and I would say that Air Canada is a good value for money. Staff was kind, everything was on time. I strongly suggest not to take last places in the aircraft, in the middle of its tail, when it gets 3 instead of 4. Thought that it can benefit with extra space for my legs, but I was wrong. Moreover, screen ahead wasn't directly in front of me, so I had to watch movies with my head constantly turned - my mistake to choose that seat. Stop in Montreal wasn't comfortable (crossing border, changing plane, picking up luggage and sending it again) and it lasted too long, in my opinion.

1101,we won't fly them again,Alia Calloo,Not Verified,"This was our first time flying with Air Canada, and we won't fly them again. Our seats were on opposite sides of the plane, until just before boarding when they eventually gave us seats together. The seats were not comfortable, and there wasn't enough legroom.  The staff were not entirely friendly. The food wasn't filling and too little for a long haul flight. On our flight to London, the air hostess was very ignorant, as our in flight entertainment didn't work for about 2.5 hours of the hour flight. The connection for the headphones didn't work properly and we couldn't enjoy the entertainment. ",3rd October 2015,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Calgary,Sep-15,1,1,1,3,3,0,1,111
1102,would fly with them again,Paul Weiss,Not Verified,"Air Canada was a great airline to fly, with a good choice of inflight entertainment on screens at every seat. The staff and cabin crew were courteous and helpful. Leg room was a little tight but can be expected on a small aircraft, also the seats were a bit old but cabin was clean and inviting. I would appreciate more selection of inflight snacks and drinks. The headphones for sale were of bad quality and only worked in one ear and not worth the price.

1103,never book Air Canada again,Debra Medina,Not Verified,"We were supposed to leave Indianapolis on September 5, 2015, traveling to Narita Airport Tokyo to join a Trafalgar tour. Upon checking flight status for our 6:00 a.m. flight, we discovered the flight had been cancelled. We called Air Canada to reschedule as there was plenty of time on the ground in Toronto and we could easily have made our Tokyo flight. No one at Air Canada had the slightest interest in helping us, telling us that we would have to leave on Sunday, September 6th, instead. I'm still kicking myself for agreeing to this. We missed our pickup service from Narita Airport to our hotel, included in the price of the tour, and had to arrange and pay for transportation out-of-pocket. More importantly, we missed the entire first day of the tour and saw nothing of Tokyo at all. This was an expensive, once-in-a-lifetime trip for us and the incompetence and indifference of Air Canada caused a great deal of disappointment. Upon contacting Air Canada after our return, so that we could get the required paperwork to submit to the trip interruption insurance, we were told that the reason for the cancellation on Sept. 5th was that a flight attendant had been unable to get through security. Why this was our problem, and why another flight attendant could not be assigned, is beyond me. Thanks, Air Canada, for ruining what should've been a fantastic vacation.

Reasonable legroom and no problem finding space for cabin baggage on a full flight. Service was friendly and efficient. Regular offers of water were made throughout the flight. Food fine, not the best but ok. Not a peep out of the captain all flight. Ridiculous seat-back monitor, took me a while to master it (press slightly up and to the left of whatever you want). The earphone socket was on its way out; sound was intermittent, but this may be because I was using my own headphones. Good choice of movies and TV, but no wifi.

1105,pretty good value for money ,D Bracegirdle,Not Verified,"In general Air Canada do a good job with their transatlantic flights and represent pretty good value for money (currently undercutting Air Transat on many flights). The planes offer standard legroom, a good level of cleanliness, attentive service and a really good infotainment system. They seem to have a consistent problem in my experience of boarding in a timely manner (nearly all my flights have left a little late).  The food is generally good, and the drink service on my last flight was regular, generous and friendly. The downsides - the last 2 times I have flown with them they messed up my meal orders. The time before last they did not have a gluten free option as I had requested. The last time they gave me a gluten free meal with chicken in it. I am a fusspot gluten free/veggie (which had been noted on the agent website's booking form), luckily my wife had the vegetarian meal which happened to be gluten free. Their official response - they can only cater for one dietary requirement. Sad to see this in the 21st century, so if you don't fit into a particular box, bring your own food along to avoid disappointment. Fair do's to Air Canada though, they do keep offering money off when they mess up, but I would prefer a meal I can eat with no fuss or bother. My only other minor dislike is having the headphone socket on the armrest of the seat where it is really easy to knock it out or damage the socket.",29th September 2015,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to London ,Jul-15,3,4,3,4,4,0,4,111

Had to ask staff to get me something when I became obvious that he was not going to get me anything. Headphones where dirty and staff provided a replacement. Bread in a plastic bag, 2 types of salad and fruit for an appetizer and horrible main, dessert included more fruit, offer of coffee once and no offer of water or any drinks. Breakfast included fruit and bread in plastic and water in a plastic container. Staff not willing to make you comfortable, they seem to have no understanding of good customer service.

Entertainment was great, with a 18 inch screen and extended choice of movie and tv. Staff were very unhappy doing the job, no smiles.

1113,getting your luggage intact is essential,Marc Vanden Berghe,Not Verified,"Arriving at Toronto for a tour of Canada, we had no luggage. Air Canada told us it was delayed. So it has been for the 10 days of our stay. Inefficiency and lack of will to solve the problem at Toronto Air Canada baggage desk. Contact with their Baggage Customer Care Center by phone was impossible in French, in English, totally inefficient - this center is located in Delhi India (no kidding!). The employees of the hotels we stayed in were unable to get anything from Air Canada. All way during our tour, we were told: ""alas, they are notorious for the fact"". Departing from Montreal, the first decent and willing to help employee of Air Canada we met managed to retrace our lost suitcase in Toronto - got it redirected to Montreal, and put automatically on our flight back. Arriving in Brussels, we got quite a nasty surprise - it looked like our good Samsonite was attacked by some frantic ice hockey player. Okay, we didn't lose our sense of humor, but let's be serious, service on board may be good, and the crew may be doing a good job too, getting your luggage intact is essential.

An Air Canada agent stated that the bags would arrive in Rome on 27 May. The number given to me to call the Rome airport to determine the status of the lost luggage never answered even though I and various Italian friends repeatedly called it. Air Canada was aware of this issue and promised to contact the Rome airport on our behalf but they never did so. My bag was delivered to my home on June 11th, five days after we had returned to the US. My husband's bag was delivered on July 11th. Air Canada promised us a passenger reimbursement for expenses we incurred because we had no luggage. Nevertheless, Air Canada they ignored my claim for this reimbursement.

Upon arrival with two disabled wheel chair bounded individuals it took 45 minutes for them to get off the plane. When the ramp finally appeared for them to deplane, the mechanism was not wide enough for the wheelchairs to reach the door, so the persons had to walk the ramp in order to reach the wheelchair. The return trip was worse. The flight was delayed from 5:45 to midnight. At midnight, there was no staff trained to bring the equipment for my disabled friends. Those commuter planes have door which drop down with steps and require healthy ability to maneuver which my friend did not have. Without any consideration of what we had been through, the flight desk attendant said that we would have to stay in a hotel because there was no way to get them on the flight. We said no - so in the pouring rain, me, my husband and the caregiver manually walked (me actually moving one foot at the time up the steps) the caregiver in front and my husband in back) up the stairs and closely guided his wife who had a little more ability up the steps.

1123,will never fly Air Canada again,Carole Ormesher,Not Verified,"Return economy flight from London to Vancouver with Air Canada. The crew were rude and indifferent, customer service does not seem to be their thing.  One male crew member was the rudest I've ever encountered. He openly and loudly complained about taking rubbish from a passenger; moaned about most things as he made his way through the cabin and had the worst attitude imaginable to every situation. Why do any of these people continue to do this job if they don't like the public? I guess this is a good route for cabin staff and rewards them for their years of service. It's not cheap to fly with Air Canada, we paid a lot for the seats - they're not a budget airline but offer worse service than one. The seats are poorly designed, the buttons for the remote are built onto the passenger armrest : it's almost impossible not to lean on the panel whilst seated, so the lights, volume, and service button are frequently accidentally pressed, it's very annoying. Not that this bothered the flight crew, who never attended a service call on either leg of the journey for anyone. The food in economy is poor, and on the first leg of the journey, one male crew told me he had no idea what type of chicken it was, it was just a chicken meal!

1124,Air Canada accepted full liability,Gill Stafford,Not Verified,"I tried to give the documentation with instructions on disconnecting my son's electric wheelchair to the baggage handler in Halifax. He refused to take them saying he knew what to do. Air Canada insists on this documentation which should be fastened to the wheelchair by the baggage handler. When we arrived at Heathrow, special Needs staff lifted G into his wheelchair; he switched the power on but his chair was dead. We spent the four hours between our flight to Manchester with engineers, ground staff and special needs staff but no-one could fix the chair. The headrest appeared broken too. We were transferred to a different terminal in a manual chair. We spent a further two hours at Manchester where staff tried in vain to find the problem and complete paperwork confirming damage. Staff read the wheelchair manual but this was too technical for a layperson to understand.We borrowed a manual chair to take G home, his own broken chair being delivered home late the following evening. Air Canada have accepted full liability and will pay the nhs for repairs (it's an nhs wheelchair). The repair contractor found the baggage handler had disconnected every possible connection in the wheelchair rather than disconnecting one easily accessible plug for the flight duration as was in the written instructions he refused to read. The wheelchair had to be completely stripped down for the reconnections to be made. Air Canada say they will also compensate us as G had to sit in his emergency basic canvas seated manual wheelchair for two days. He cannot move around in it and as the back does not tilt it makes it difficult for him to eat and drink. With regard to the flight, the seats were comfy with plenty of legroom - and I have long legs! Staff were polite. Breakfast was a choice of pancake or omelette. The latter had dried up potatoes and diced veg with a revolting gloopy spinach sauce. Awful! At least they carried our luggage - they left our main bag behind on the outward leg and G had no change of clothes or battery charger until they delivered it to our hotel 24 hours later.",5th September 2015,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Halifax to Heathrow,Sep-15,5,5,1,3,1,0,2,113

Only 1 person explained the situation to passengers and had the coupons. After that we had to wait several hours before we arrived at the hotel. There they told us that the hotel was overbooked and we had to go back to the airport. We got another hotel and 4.5 hours later we got to bed (6.30am). In the evening we flew to Amsterdam, 24 hours delayed. The service of Air Canada was poor. With the coupons they give you, you can't buy a  meal and a drink.

Our connecting flight to Amsterdam was missed and nobody seemed to care. Crew were not friendly, however the worst part was the food. Airline food may not be the best, but this was awful.

1127,"incompetent, disinterested and unhelpful ",Coleen Greenwood,Not Verified,"I have never experienced such a diabolical level of customer service. Incompetent, disinterested and unhelpful staff. Having been delayed by 7 hours due to a technical fault resulting in missing a connecting flight we were met by unhelpful AC staff who informed us that we would have to sort our own connecting flight out as she had already worked too many extra hours this week and was going home. We were then asked to make our way to a hotel for the night only to be told by the hotel when we got there that they didn't have enough rooms. This all happened at 2.30 in the morning at 6am we finally got to another hotel. The appalling service doesn't end there. I appreciate flights can be delayed but I expect a better level of care especially from an airline who states their vision is ""to make every customer feel valued"".

1128,Air Canada customer review,R Ralos,Not Verified,"I recently flew from London to  Edmonton. It was a 9 hour flight and for the most part alright. The crew was very nice and helpful. When I boarded the plane, the flight attendant took one look at my Lebanese passport and spoke to me in fluent Arabic! It was quite the lovely surprise,and great to know they cater to more then just Canada's national languages. The macaroni cheese I ate was on the low end, I would rate it a 4/10. The movie selection was alright, but the music choices were poor. Free headphones, free snacks anytime you asked, with good coffee.

1130,Air Canada customer review,Lalia Laud,Not Verified,"The cabin crew were disinterested and slow. They act and like they are doing a special favour for you by pouring you a drink or even getting you some napkins. Blankets and headsets weren't offered but sold to you. You either bring your own (which takes up space), buy theirs, or freeze without being able to hear the movie. Comfort levels will decrease and the flight attendants won't be able to help much. A flight attendant told me that they cannot help me lift my luggage into the high luggage compartment. Any person complaining about any slight discomfort with reason were rudely put on the spot (the lights were broken and couldn't be turned off for one of the passengers so the passenger had to ask about it or else he couldn't nap. The flight attendant only tried their minimum best to help by taping the lights and then left him alone. The taped lights continued to fall off but the flight attendants just ignored him and responded only if the passenger actively tried to complain again. The flight attendant just tossed my napkins down on the table and left without a reply. I found it quite rude and impolite. The seats were new but poorly designed. The buttons for the remote were built onto the armrest of the passengers. It looks simple and basic but it was terribly uncomfortable for the passengers. Thus, many times the service button was accidentally pressed causing the flight attendants to become annoyed at us even though it was an accident. The lights, service, or volume buttons would accidentally turn on whenever I try to rest my arms on the armrest. A suggestion may be to add a cover for the buttons so that these small inconveniences can be avoided in the future. Sadly, I bet this will not be implemented anytime soon as this review will be ignored and forgotten.",29th August 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Toronto,Aug-15,2,1,2,3,1,0,2,114
1131,Air Canada customer review,F Vedrenne,Not Verified,"Using MEX T1 is not always pleasant as it is crowded and small. Check in agents were friendly, but when I asked if there were late upgrades available, they said that business class was full. This turned out to be false, as there were two seats available. Boarding started late, but was done in an organized way. Once on board we were greeted by some very friendly Montreal-based crew members. The two francophone flight attendants were very friendly in a not-fake way as opposed to the overcompensated service that can be found on some airlines, the anglophone flight attendant looked a bit surly and was not friendly, but she did her job fine and was polite. It is a bit of a shame that food is the typical American ""buy-on-board"" selection. The options available were similar to any café food (sandwiches and wraps) served on a napkin along with other unfortunate junky choices. All non-alcoholic drinks were free of charge. (TIP: It is worth it to pay $7 when booking online, this will allow you to choose a main dish and a snack from the menu at no extra cost. Bear in mind that these items will be more expensive on board and that you will need to be carrying a credit card). The airplane was in great conditions in spite of its age. In flight entertainment was the standard personal video, but choices were not very enticing. Arrival was done in a very organized manner, and crew made sure that passengers with tight connections left the plane first, which is very considerate. Overall, Air Canada offers a very good solid and consistent service by its human capital, it is always nice flying with them.",27th August 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MEX to YUL,Aug-15,3,5,2,3,4,0,5,114

The suites have lots of room,huge TV screen,massage function, and really private which is nice if flying alone. The service was great and my only beef is the hot meals could use an upgrade as well. I fly business class all the time with Air Canada and the meals don't ever seem to change. All in all I am really pleased with Air Canada business class and especially the new 787 service. I am the same guy who gave Air Rouge bottom marks so I felt when an airline does a good job it deserves mention as well.

1133,Air Canada customer review,Shar Levine,Not Verified,"I have no idea how Air Canada rates as one of the best airlines in North America. We flew business class and my head phones didn't work. They offered me some sort of points. But the real problem was my luggage tagged, ""priority"", came off last. I waited 45 minutes while all the luggage was unloaded and my ride home drove endlessly around the airport. Last luggage down on the carousel. I tried to contact them today on their ""chat line"" and no one seems to be working there as I waited 30 minutes without anyone answering.

1134,Air Canada customer review,Peter Grevstad,Not Verified,"The only thing I can conclude after numerous flights with AC over the years is that in terms of their international economy they're no longer trying to make it pleasant. I had an okay seat, 31K, at a bulkhead, with no window unfortunately. There's a jump seat there for crew, but the staff member simply asked me if I knew how to open the door in the event of an emergency, then told me not to open the door if it were underwater, and then walked away to join her friends at the rear. The food choices were awful. There was no drink service until dinner, and that was rather late as we were waiting for connecting passengers who never showed up, and whose luggage had to be offloaded. I put on a sleeping mask I'd brought along, and put a blanket over my head, and slept for nearly the entire flight, as the catering was so basic. I could just as well have bought a $2.99 frozen pasta at a grocery and have had it heated, such was the dinner service. Also, the IFE, especially the map, still does not work in the economy cabins. The FA said she'd reset my unit, which I doubt she did. I've seen numerous complaints about this. How hard is it to rectify this?",23rd August 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to LHR,Aug-15,2,1,1,1,2,0,3,114
1135,Air Canada customer review,Peter Grevstad,Not Verified,"What a difference a cabin makes. I flew back to YYZ from LHR on 20 August. I learned the flight was full, and as I was in economy in a seat with no window (31K) I asked if there were any other economy seats that had a window. I was only offered the middle of the middle section, which I declined. I then asked if my Aeroplan miles would be of any use, but was told there were people with higher status on the flight. It doesn't hurt to ask, and it certainly helps to ask nicely, and to be decently dressed. I had a brief chat with ground staff, who were not in AC uniforms. Moments later, one of the ground staff approached me with a huge smile on her face, and a boarding card in her hand. I was taken up front to executive first, seat 10D. I've flown this cabin before, and was really pleased about the upgrade. It didn't matter to me at all that I didn't have a window at my seat. Such a huge difference from economy. Crew really can't do enough for you in the premium cabin. There were bubbles for boarding, along with pretzels, due to an allergic pax near me. I went up to the galley after takeoff to enjoy a glass of decent (but not really good) champagne, and some hot nuts. I then returned to my seat for meal service. There was middling champagne, but excellent reds and whites served with lunch. I had a seafood appetizer which was good, but which was not presented very attractively. Then I had a main of mushroom and herb-crusted lamb with red currant jus. I had this on a flight a few years ago out of CPH, and it was as good as I remembered, cooked rare. The CSA worked my side of the cabin, and he was attentive and friendly. The meal was filling, and so I skipped the cheese, and had ice cream and a cognac, and settled in for a sleep on my way back to Toronto. There was a snack service before landing, but the sandwiches, though wrapped, were really stale. The interesting thing is that the IFE's map feature does work in Business Class, but doesn't in economy: why is that? A pleasure to ride up front, but a drastic difference from down the back with economy pax. Again, I'll suggest that AC can do a lot to make their economy experience better: after all, tickets are about 1400$C for this trip in high season.

They gave us the food as if they were throwing it on to the tray table. Both of my kids could not finish the meal which is unusual. This is a long haul flight and 3 meals were served. One hot meal with very little food. The light meal was a cup of ramen noodle. Then the breakfast was another poorly prepared meal. The entertainment options were very limited.

1138,Air Canada customer review,T Eldem,Not Verified,"Checked into the flight using the priority counter and was served by a surly agent. Boarding was via a jetway but we had to go up the stairs to get to the top of it. Aircraft was stuffy and lighting dim. Flight departed 15 minutes late. The seat was comfortable but legroom was limited. AC must generate quite a bit of revenue from the so called ""Preferred Seats"" in economy class for which there is an extra charge while the rest of the seats offer a cramped experience. FA's were prompt with their service which consisted of a single beverage of your choice. There were no refills offered which was likely due to the short duration of the flight. Bathroom at the rear was smelly and the odour reached deep into the cabin whenever the door was opened. IFE was OK but AC has now disabled the ability to fast forward through the commercials at the beginning of the program which forces you to sit through unwanted ads. This used to be an issue and AC had implemented the fast forward feature but it appears they have now regressed. Honestly, who wants to sit through commercials? There were no announcements from the flight deck and the flight arrived 17 minutes late.

1141,Air Canada customer review,Mesha Chow,Not Verified,"A 14-hour plus direct flight from Sydney to Vancouver was quite pleasant initially. Had a few hours of napping, to which the first snack/meal service was provided. However, I was hungry a couple of hours later and I did what I have done with other full-service carriers - I asked the attendant for a snack. I was told ""No"" and looked at as if I had asked for the strangest request. At this point in time, I was desperate enough to fork out money for a snack, and apparently, they do not have that option either. If only, maybe, the staff had gone the extra mile to explain that there was a lack of snacks (as it was a full flight), that they do not have this service with Air Canada (they literally only offer 1 snack and 1 meal service, as per their website), or if she was nice enough to offer a beverage, I would not be writing this review. Our connecting flight from Vancouver to Montreal was delayed, so we missed it. The only saving grace, was that the next flight that we were put on was only a 2-hour wait, which isn't too bad. The next plane was full, so I was seated separately from my partner, and had my hand-luggage involuntarily checked-in upon boarding the aircraft, because there was not enough overhead compartment space. The Vancouver to Montreal flight, was by no means any more pleasant, as they do not serve complimentary food, but available for purchase.

1146,Air Canada customer review,Cheryl Ashdown,Not Verified,"Our family's first experience with Air Canada was in June 2015 flying from Portland to Paris.

My family spent the first two days in Paris with no luggage as all three pieces were lost in Montreal. Other family took the same itinerary home from Paris on a trip a month later (August 2015). Could lightening strike twice? We checked three pieces of carry on luggage and all of it was lost in Montreal. We arrived home last night. One bag has been found and the other two have not.

1158,Air Canada customer review,T Eldem,Not Verified,"Slow check-in in Beijing. Used the Air China Business Lounge which is consistently disappointing. Flight was ready to leave the gate on time but ATC had grounded all flights due to pending thunderstorms. The captain did a stellar job keeping the passengers informed while we waited on the tarmac for 4 hours. The crew served water, juice and snacks during this time. Once airborne, the service was prompt and FA's generally friendly although a couple of them appeared to be annoyed and uninterested in their job. Dinner and breakfast were OK with reasonable number of meal and drink choices. The pods are at the end of their service life with cushions becoming inadequate for restful sleep. IFE content was mediocre and sound quality was poor. Due to the lengthy delay in Beijing, I missed my connection but the wonderfully polite and helpful agent who took my call at AC's Concierge Desk had me secured on the very last flight out and even had my boarding pass delivered to the arrival gate in Toronto. It is nice to see there are still some service-minded people left at AC. The flight from Toronto to Montreal had very basic service given the short duration and the time of day.

The service we recieved at the ground desk was terrible. We were not treated with much respect almost as if we, the customers were something that was not important. After our disappointing encounter with the ground staff we got on board. We found out that our light and attendant call button were both broken. We got complaint forms however when we tried to enter them online all three cards had invalid claim numbers and therefore we cant claim anything.

1162,Air Canada customer review,J Cowles,Not Verified,"Came off a flight from London and had booked an internal flight to get me to Edmonton. Turns out it would have been quicker to drive. We boarded on time but were then told that there was an electrical fault with one of the radios. We waited on the tarmac for an hour and then an engineer came and replaced the offending part. During this time, communication from the flight attendant was scant and when he did speak it was comical. Each time he read the announcements from his dog-eared handbook looking like he would rather be anywhere else in the world from here. We eventually took off and the flight to Edmonton was fine. On landing we were in the middle of a thunderstorm so there was no tractor available to tow us to the gate. We waited around 30 mins and then we were good to go. Coming back it was another story. I was booked on the 3pm flight back to Calgary to connect to AC850 at 17.50. I checked in and was happily waiting at the gate when my cousin called to tell me we were delayed (she was getting updates from an app on her phone). There was nothing to say we were delayed on any of the airport screens. Further updates came through to say the delay was being extended and then it finally came up at the gate, although no announcements were made. I had to watch the 4pm and 5pm flights depart on time and then finally the 3pm flight was cancelled and we were transferred to the 6pm flight. Obviously I had missed my connection by that point. Cabin staff on the return leg were rude and unhelpful when I tried to enquire how best to get to my next gate at Calgary. I understand that airlines are always prone to delays but the lack of communication really annoyed me. I'll definitely try to get a direct flight next time.

1163,Air Canada customer review,J Cowles,Not Verified,"Flew out economy but paid extra to get 35A which is an exit row seat. Seat was ok but a bit snug width-wise. Queues for the loos tended to stand right in front of me so it was a busy area. Inflight entertainment was good but would benefit from more recent films. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful and always happy to answer questions. Food was really good, a lot better than other economy flights I have taken. Coming back I upgraded to Business Class and was given seat 7a. I didn't get to choose as I missed my original flight due to a connecting flight cancellation so was just happy to have made the flight. Seat was ok but uncomfortable in fully flat mode - it would have been a lot more comfortable with an extra cushion layer. Flight attendants were friendly but rushed to get everything done before people wanted to sleep. Food was good but some choices ran out quite quickly.

My husband and I sat in the last row of first class and my kids were in the first row of coach. The first class row was literally right in front of the row my children sat in. There were absolutely no issues on our leg out to China with my kids sitting in coach. I was never told that this was against policy. On our way back the ticketing agent refused to issue our tickets. We tried upgrading the kids that was refused because on the second leg of the trip there were no first class seats available. However, on the second leg of the trip there were only economy seats on the flight. The desk agent made us wait for over an hour refusing to give me back my passports. They said the only way we could fly is if they downgraded my ticket for an economy class seat. The agent refused to allow me to keep my first class seat.

A small but tasty snack and full bar service was available on the short flight to Toronto and the FA was friendly and very efficient. Flight from Toronto to Beijing had an orderly boarding process and was ready for departure however a last minute delay was encountered to remove luggage belonging to a passenger who did not show up. The aircraft interior looked in dire need of an overhaul with floor boards torn off at the pods, food splattered on the pod walls and side panels of the seat hanging loose. The service from the FA's was warm and conducted efficiently. Food was of reasonable quality and quantity and it was good to see an updated menu. There was a good selection of wines, spirits and soft drinks but there were no hot beverages available during the 13 hour flight due to a maintenance problem. I learned later in the flight that the very same aircraft had been suffering from this for the last three weeks. IFE was disappointing as the content had not been updated for the last four months and did not match what was advertised on their website and magazines. The pod style seats need an upgrade as they are worn out and becoming uncomfortable. The flight arrived late but mainly due to congestion in Beijing. Luggage was delivered promptly. Overall it was an OK experience but lack of coffee and tea on a very long flight (especially to China) was inexcusable.",21st July 2015,Business,Business Class,Montreal to Beijing via Toronto,Jul-15,2,4,2,1,4,0,2,117

Rather, you write in an e-mail complaint and are told you'll get a response withing 25 days to a month.

1171,Air Canada customer review,Sydnie Jimerson,Not Verified,"I was disappointed by my travel day with Air Canada from Vancouver to Toronto connecting in Toronto to Dublin. The first leg was delayed by an unknown amount because of maintenance issues. They bumped me and other passengers to a different plane so that we would make our connections (after delaying for about 1 hour and 45 minutes), which was appreciated but I ended up in a terrible seat and still cutting it extremely close and I have no idea when the original plane actually ended up taking off. We landed in Toronto and almost ran off the plane to try to make what I thought would be a very short connection of about 30 minutes in a huge airport. Turns out the next leg was also delayed, so far by 2 hours (I'm still sitting her, waiting to board and fuming) for, again, maintenance. Apparently this time they know what's wrong but they have to go get a part to replace something in one of the pilot/copilots chairs? At least that's what I gleaned from the flight attendants and various other passengers discussing the issue. I understand that delays happen sometimes. But its a little ridiculous for both of these planes to need last minute maintenance. We haven't been offered any kind of compensation for all of this trouble and I'm annoyed. I've flown air Canada before and had things go as expected but only once before and a 50/50 record isn't great.",18th July 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Toronto,Jul-15,2,3,1,3,1,0,2,118

We were supposed to catch flight AC 852 from Calgary to London, however, there was a 2.5 hour delay and accordingly there was a risk that we would miss our flight from London to Cairo. I went to the Air Canada customer service, who told us that if we missed our flight we would be compensated. However, on flight from Calgary to London I was disappointed once again, I asked the flight attendant for a can opener because I wanted to open my baby's formula but they said they didn't have one. It was very inconvenient considering that the flight was 9 hours long. They didn't give me extra food or any baby food (which was supposed to be provided since they knew there was going to be a baby on board). When we got to London at 2.57 pm, we, obviously with no surprise, missed our next flight that was planned to depart at 3pm. We were booked for the flight that leaves at 10.30 pm, thus making us stay at the airport for 7.5 hours! We were treated with no respect whatsoever. We were just given vouchers and told that was all they could do for us.

At every Check in, one or more Air Canada representatives were there with a wheelchair to transport me (with my 78 year young mom), to the next flight connection. Everyone who helped was courteous, experienced and efficient. It made the trip so much easier, and there were some very tight connections, especially in Toronto.

On board, it was a very tired looking A330. The FA's bordered on rude and threw drinks and meal trays at the passengers. The food in both quality and quantity were on par with a budget airline. Seats were OK for economy and IFE had decent selection.

Although the Toronto to Copenhagen flight is relatively short - only 7 hours - it gave me a chance to experience the excellent new product and service. Business class has a spacious 1-2-1 layout in what AC calls private pods. Private they are for you very much feel isolated from the other passengers, which I appreciate. I love the 787 big windows. It makes you feel more connected to the exterior. I also loved the new IFE with a great touch-screen product. You can view your menu and all your wines on the screen. Food was superb - this time had an outstanding chicken tikka masala. The sparkling wine though, could be improved. It's too sweet for my liking. As is expected today, the seat converts to a fully-flat bed. When sleeping, perhaps the seat is still too high up for sometimes when turning around I would hit the front console with my hips. I don't have big hips. What I also loved about this pod is plenty of storage space.

Even with Altitude status - so I can get a bullhead seat - the direct flight has appalling seat width and recline. Adding in extra economy rows so a few ""Premium Economy"" seats (is that a joke AC? ) can be jammed into this flying nightmare makes the matter worse. The 3-4-3 seats per row is a fine example of pure greed. Even the new business configuration is dire - what was wrong with the pods? I much prefer them to this arrangement.  My advice: take a connecting flight on a different plane type with a sensible seat configuration. Inflight meals, entertainment and staff are usual AC standards - nothing special but getting better.

If someone has paid for a seat on a plane, they should have that seat. After a few minutes of arguing, he assured us that we would be on the flight. When we had gone through security, we went to the customer service desk and explained what had happened. The lady there told us we did not have seats at this stage and that the guy in baggage drop had no authority to guarantee that we would get on the plane. She told us to wait at the gate to see if we were allocated a seat. After a very tense hour, and after most of the passengers had boarded, we were eventually called to the gate and given boarding passes, seated several rows apart. Compared to other airlines around the world, and particularly our domestic flights on Qantas and Virgin Australia, the standard of service is well below par.

Upon arriving at the airport, I was told I would have to pay $100 because by bag was over 50lbs and the promotion only applied to those under this weight. Once I got my boarding pass, I found that I was not seated in the window seat that I had previously booked. This was also the case for my flight from Toronto to Munich, as I had booked beside my friend flying from another city for that flight and we were at opposite ends of the plane. Then we sat at the gate in Calgary for over an hour once boarding was completed with no reasonable explanation for the delay - thankfully I had a 5 hour layover. I am a loyal customer to Air Canada and Star Alliance and I choose to fly with them above other airlines, but experiences like this that make me question my loyalty.",26th June 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Munich via Toronto,Mar-15,4,4,4,5,1,1,2,120

1192,Air Canada customer review,M Dietrch,Not Verified,"YYZ to ZRH on Boeing 787 in economy with my wife and infant. Check in staff in Toronto very helpful and the line moved quickly. Boarding and flight departure on time. I am 6'4"" and flying economy I was worried about leg room as I was unable to reserve a preferred seat. Air Canada Boeing 787 cabin was clean and felt open with the lighting and larger windows. I was surprised at the amount of leg room there was in an economy seat, as so many people have stated it was poor. My knees did touch the seat in front of myself however I was able to extend them under the seat with no problem. My wife being much shorter had plenty of room. I would suggest when travelling with an infant to take advantage of the bassinet seat as we did on the return flight. The seats are slightly narrow. The inflight entertainent was great having your own personal screen to watch numerous movies and TV shows. The only issue with these is that there is a ""remote"" control located on the arm rests. The buttons are usually pressed by the person sitting beside you which will cause your seat light and functions on the entertainment screen to be activated (sucks when watching a movies and volume keeps going up and down). The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful and service with a smile. Our first flight they even attempted to have people give up the bassinet seat to allow us to sit there. We had a great expirence flying with AC and will use them again in the future for sure. And on a side note the pasta served for the meal is much better than the chicken.",22nd June 2015,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Zurich,Jun-15,4,5,4,5,5,0,5,120
1193,Air Canada customer review,Michael Kroeker,Not Verified,"I recently traveled YWG-LHR and returned home from EDI-YWG with AC Rouge. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with how well the trip went in both directions. Outbound flight was delayed about 2 hours due to maintenance, staff kept us updated and were very pleasant. After the aircraft couldn't be fixed they quickly changed to a spare Boeing 777 in YYZ and got us going as quick as they could. Meals on board were not bad, only suggestion would be the continental breakfast could be improved. Seats were comfortable and service was good even though a full flight. Returned on Air Canada Rouge in Premium, seat was adequate, food was good but flight attendants need more training and need to act more professional.

1194,Air Canada customer review,James Halley,Not Verified,"Check in was chaotic due to bag drop desks being used for full check in. Baggage once tagged had to go to a separate area to be weighed thus taking the staff away from their desk. By the time we got through security the flight had boarded but there were a number of stragglers who boarded after us and delayed the flight. Seating in row 20 was good for a long haul flight with AVOD which was a step up from Air Canada rouge and the options were reasonably up to date with a decent choice. Toilets were also a good size. Service was fine but food was a disgrace - it was described to me as the Asian option, presumably because it was served with rice. The second meal was no better, inbetween these meals was a large sandwich stuffed full of chicken,  the odd water run now and then. Does not compare favourably with the competition on this route, even Air Canada rouge via Osaka is a better option.",19th June 2015,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Hong Kong,Jun-15,3,3,1,3,1,0,3,120
1195,Air Canada customer review,J Barendregt,Not Verified,"Last Friday I had a flight from Calgary to London Heathrow. My 9hr flight turned out as the worst flight I have had. After flying with British Airways for years now I decided to try Air Canada, but I won't again. The service and food were bad and a lot of screens and/or earphone plugs aren't working. As an single traveller, 6""4, it's not the most comfortable way of traveling. When I came on board and saw where I was seated this man asked me to change places with his wife so they could sit together. That is no problem for me, I'm pretty flexible so I helped them out. Now I sat in the middle block, had 2 seats next to me that were free. So giving up my seat wasn't a bad decision at all. I figured I could sleep well when I moved one seat up. 15mins in, the stewardess comes to me and asks me friendly if I could change seats with an older couple. I decided to give up my seat again for these people. The stewardess promised me that the seats there were as good as this one I was sitting in, except the one screen wasn't working where the man sat. We switched places and then I found out that my headphones were not working properly. Only my right earphone worked. Since the other screen wasn't working I was stuck. A little annoyed I got out of my seat again and walked up to the flight attendant who asked me to change seats. All she offered was the headphones they provide onboard, she said she would come to me in a minute. After almost an hour of waiting I had to go back to her. I ended up with some cheese and crackers, grapes and a cup of peanuts, one headphone working and a terrible feeling for letting me change my seat for other people. Besides all that the food was not good at all. From the dinner plate I got, I only ate the brownie. ",16th June 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to London Heathrow,Jun-15,1,2,1,3,2,0,2,120
1196,Air Canada customer review,Chaoxian Tian,Not Verified,"Flew from Vancouver YVR to Sydney NS YQY via Montreal YUL and Halifax YHZ. First segment from YVR to YUL was an overnight flight on an A320. Received help from YVR ground crew since this was my first air travel in Canada. The flight took off and landed on time. Cabin crew on board was good at communication and drinks were served. However no meal was served for a 5-hr flight, which was to my surprise (and then I knew that AC simply does not do that on domestic flights no matter short-haul or long-haul). En-route entertainment system was a nice touch and there were programmes for different ages and culture. Seat was not an issue since I was seated in an exit row. Second segment from YUL to YHZ was on an E190, which was one of the most comfortable single-aisle aircraft in my opinion. Had entertainment system as well. Also, only drinks were served. This time I was seated in a normal row and the seat pitch was just enough to accomodate myself (6'2"" and 240lbs). Third segment was also a short one from YHZ to YQY, operated by Jazz on a 30 years old DeHavilland DHC8-100 (Dash8) turboprop. Cabin attendant was friendly and served drinks and snacks. Seat pitch was even tighter this time but since the seat cushion was shortened, there was still enough room to seat myself. Overall my first travel with AC was satisfying, but next time I'll make sure I'm not hungry before boarding.

The flight to San Francisco was OK except for the fact that by the time that the FA got to be he said that he was all out of meat, fish, and chicken and the only thing he had left was pasta. I am on a low carb diet so I ate very little. In fact, he told me that I should eat salad. On the flight from Los Angeles, there were sufficient meals so that I had my choice. The FA here was very pleasant and accommodating. In general, Air Canada business class for North America is nothing special with seats that do not provide a lot more room than economy and the food is only the middle of the road.

They switch many popular routes out of Vancouver to Rouge. My one and only trip on Rouge to Hawaii was terrible. Uncomfortable business seats, teens as flight attendants were confused. Secondly, the new business configuration in order to cram in more customers is the worst I have flown on. Impossible to lie flat as there is no space for your feet and the serving tray is like a guillotine when opened. Thirdly, they significantly increase the e-credits required to receive an upgrade and at the same time cut in half the Aeroplan miles earned on short haul flights. I cannot find any positive change.

I was badly surprised by the lack of professionalism of Air Canada FA. I was spoilt with hot liquids, water and juice 3 times during the flight from Beijing to Toronto, by different FA. Full flight both times, no smiles and kindness from any of the flight attendants, they were rude and seem to be very upset with some of the passengers. Our flight from PEK-YYZ was delayed due to two passengers missing, and while waiting on board, one of the FA's over the microphone said ""Perhaps we should give a round applause to the two passengers missing"". I find this very disrespectful and inappropriate. Overall, not a pleasant flight, rude cabin crew who shouted for people to remain seated, they didnt seem to care for passengers and they we were just doing their job with minimum standards.

We flew Alaska Air there and returned on Air Canada flights. Big mistake! We booked last October and had confirmed reservations. From the moment we arrived at the airport, there were problems. First, their carry-on size is smaller than other airlines. OK. We repacked and paid for an extra checked bag. Then we proceeded to get our boarding passes only to find out we were on standby. No reasonable explanation offered. We proceeded to the gate where I stood ready to be first on line. The gate agent was patronizing and condescending, at best. He finally told me it was my fault since I did not select seats when I booked (the system said I could not select seats and would have to get them later.) I have travelled the world over for business - I am not a rookie at this. We waited and did get seats. Then they asked people to check their carry-on bags for free since the flight was full. We did it and were assured we were checked through to our final destination. Our first leg is completed - comfortable seats and good food options on board. Upon arrival in Toronto, we had to clear customs. We do all we are required to do, but we are not cleared to proceed because our bags have not been accounted for. We wait and are in fear of missing our next flight. Air Canada stamps our card so we can proceed. We run for the gate only to find the plane is not even there. We finally board and get to our final destination late. We wait for our bags and one is missing. No one from Air Canada is to be found and their phone system is very slow. We finally get through and are told the system is down and they can go nothing to track our bag. We did get our bag.

I did the YUL-LHR on May the 7th and I was on one of the newer Boeing 777-300ER with 3x4x3 abreast economy class. The cabin was new and spotless, seats were really comfortable and inflight entertainment was excellent. Service was really good, but the second meal was only a very bad slice of cake. LHR-YYZ was on an older 777-300ER with 3x3x3 abreast economy on May 26th. I could not perceive any difference in width between the inbound and the outbound flights. Most of the cabin crew on board this flight were the best AC bunch I have had in a while, there was one that was very nasty to a passenger whose English could not be understood easily. Finally, the YYZ-MEX leg on an Airbus 319 was a breeze as the cabin was almost empty. I had encountered the CSM working in this flight before, and I have to say he does know how to co-ordinate a team. Air Canada does not offer free meals in its flights to Mexico anymore, but I prefer them over the competition because they are a no-nonsense airline with hard-working.

1206,Air Canada customer review,Rob DiSaverio,Not Verified,My wife and I flew Ottawa to Vancouver return. All the planes were full. The positive was that the airline crew were friendly enough and worked well together on all flights. On the way there we flew threw Montreal and boarded an A330-300. A nice big plane with 2-4-2 which works well for couples. On the way back we flew direct on a smaller A320 with 3 and 3 seating. The back of the plane felt very warm and all the restrooms are at the back so there is always a constant flow of people. Air Canada does a good job of providing seat back screens to their fleet. Movie choices were acceptable but regular TV either wasn't available or the selection was poor. The food and beverage cart went by twice and water was offered more often. Nothing is free except the water and soft drinks. I should mention Air Canada has improved it's telephone waiting times considerably.,6th June 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,4,0,0,3,121
1207,Air Canada customer review,R Simon,Not Verified,ORD-YYZ on Apr 23 on an Embraer 175 operated by Jazz and YYZ-CPH on Apr 28 on a 787-800 Dreamliner after a stopover in Toronto both legs in Business Class. ORD-YYZ was on time FA's were friendly and fairly attentive a dinner (chicken skewers on warm salad) was served nothing special but fine for the short hop. Seats were comfortable for the short flight however not as good as the first class seats on US airlines. Check-in in ORD as well as in YYZ worked well manned premium counters and just a short wait. AC uses UA lounge in ORD which was poor as expected. Fairly crowded no actual food some limited snacks most alcoholic drinks were for purchase but some were complimentary such as house wine and one type of domestic beer. However the lounge has a manned bar which for practical purposes means as this is the US tips are expected anyway. Boarding was uneventful which is good. Arrival in Pearson a mess arriving passengers are held back midway in the terminal by airport employees while crossing embarking passengers make their way to their plane. This lasted for several minutes with frustrated arriving passengers with tight connections having to wait for the embarkation process to finish. Also airport employees were rather rude in this situation. Customs hall before border control packed and 45 minutes wait to get through border control. Arrival process in Person obviously not AC's fault but still very unpleasant; not a good first impression for Canada. Check-in and security at Person was a breeze. YYZ-CPH was boarded on time but then delayed for almost an hour at the gate and on the tarmac because one generator did not work. For this reason the plane was also unpleasantly hot while on the ground. Once in the air everything was fine. The Dreamliner is obviously a modern and comfortable plane. AC’s version has a 1-2-1 pod style configuration with lie flat seats. IFE was AVOD with a decent movie selection. Crew of friendly senior FA's were excellent professional courteous and attentive. Air Canada is obviously going for a European style of service rather than following the style of US based airlines. Also FA's were regularly present in the cabin to check if something is needed and generous with wine refills. Dinner was a seafood appetizer salad and roasted cod plus various dessert choices. I thought dinner service was very good for airline food. Also featuring some Canadian flavors as well as a Canadian Chardonnay. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Skipped breakfast in favor of sleeping an additional hour so cannot comment on its quality. AC's Maple Leaf Lounge again excellent comfortable spacious and with various quite good food options and a nice selection of drinks. A very pleasant experience and several quality steps above the lounges operated e.g. by UA or AA. Arrival in CPH was delayed 45 minutes but fine otherwise. Border Control in CPH fast and efficient and quite surprisingly for CPH no long wait for the luggage to arrive. All in all two very pleasant flights. Have not flown AC previously because of the airlines mixed reputation but wanted to make use of the stopover possibility in Toronto and to fly the Dreamliner. Will definitely include AC in my future travel plans after this experience. (Star Alliance Gold).,6th June 2015,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,4,0,0,5,121

Next day the same aircraft was used to resume the trip. The returning flight Geneva-Montreal was also cancelled due to mechanical issues and it was the same aircraft. I lost it at the airport when the useless staff just give me a new flight for next day without even try to look for an alternative flight (several flights going to Paris for instance). I had to call customer service in Canada to change another flight also with Air Canada to South America. Long story short try another company and do not spend you money on this company.

I was in transit at Pearson en route from Tel Aviv to Dulles with an original layover of 2 hours 55 minutes. My initial flight AC 85 from Tel Aviv was late departing and arrived in Toronto at 5.50pm an hour and 15 minutes late. That still left me more than an hour-and-a-half to make it to flight UA 3803 scheduled to depart at 7.30pm. After disembarking from flight AC 85 and reaching Pearson's passport control an Air Canada attendant advised me to go through U.S. customs and proceed to my gate. I arrived at the gate on time at 7pm when boarding was under way. When my boarding pass was scanned a UA gate attendant said I could not board because the Dulles flight was oversold and I had been bumped from the flight some time earlier. No reason was given for the bump. The UA gate staff told me to speak to Air Canada about booking another flight back to Washington and I later had to cross the border into Canada and stay overnight at a hotel paid for by Air Canada. I boarded Air Canada flight AC 7354 to Washington DCA the next morning April 13th. After arriving at DCA I discovered to my dismay that the suitcase I had checked in at Tel Aviv was not on my flight.

On our trip home I asked for a black coffee. She said she was making more as several travelers had asked. I did not my coffee or anything else to drink.

1217,Air Canada customer review,A Ngui,Not Verified,Flew YEG-YYZ-YEG April 22 and May 2 return. Was using their A320 with 3-3 abreast in Economy. Flight was 99% full and most travellers already paid and selected their seats. When my turn for the 24 hour seat selection check-in comes the reservation system selected what was left for me spouse and 2 children. With it being 3-3 we got the middle and aisle of either side in row 32 BCDE. This is the last row because the ones behind us were reserved for crew only. Its gets annoying as the 2 lavatories lineups extend past your row so you get a constant flow of people going in the almost 4 hour flight. Meals for purchase are fine for those that want it. The thing that ticked me off was only beverages were served complimentary. No snacks at all on this flight. There is one FA for business class cabin while two for the economy cabin. FAs are there to do their jobs and that is it. The boarding call in YEG was good where they actually boarded the Zone 3 properly by calling out pax with children board first and enough advance notice was given. In YYZ forget that. Zone 3 was not properly announced and it jumped from announcing Zone 1 hasty Zone 2 and a hurried Zone 3 general boarding with not enough time for parents with young children to board first announced. Its seems like a mess. I had to pay for my stroller since its not the umbrella type and their small dimensions. $25 each way. Really pathetic domestic service for AC as its a flag carrier and does not seem to be like one. Seating is the older one but legroom and seat pitch seems small already. Imagine if they decide to go with their high density seating like in their new 777s. When the person in front of me reclines I almost hit my knees.,10th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,2,1,3,0,0,2,122

We opted to not got to the hotel as it would be a short stay so we checked back in and waited in the Maple Leaf Lounge. We reported for boarding at 8.30am but were informed that due to weather at YYT we would be delayed until 11.30am. Air Canada agents handed out meal vouchers and we returned to the lounge. Flight departed at 11.30am and we arrived YYT without incident. Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely fly Air Canada again. The delays were unavoidable as no airline controls the weather but we felt that Air Canada did everything they could to keep us informed and comfortable throughout. I should add that we were loyal Westjet customers until this year and harboured a dislike of Air Canada before this trip but we have definitely changed our opinion.,8th May 2015,,Business Class,,,4,5,5,4,0,0,4,122
1219,Air Canada customer review,S Lane,Not Verified,"AC1828 Kahului OGG to Vancouver YVR April 30th. This was one of the worst trips on Air Canada that I have experienced. Really how many people can they jam on a plane? The seats were so close together I had trouble and I am only 5ft two inches tall. I cannot imagine how taller people manage or bigger people for that matter as the seats are also very narrow. The seats barely reclined maybe and inch or so. This was a long flight 5.5 hours with no food offered. Drinks of just tea coffee water and some soft drinks offered only twice in the whole trip. Not sure what the attendants do in all this time. The reading lights for all the middle section of seats did not work. This was an international flight - US to Canada but I think Air Canada views it as one country. The flight crew had the nerve to say on leaving ""Hope you had a good flight"". Obviously they have never flown in economy on this flight. My neck ached so badly after this flight.",8th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,122
1220,Air Canada customer review,D Chiu,Not Verified,FRA to YYZ. Business class pods were wonderful. We fly these several times a year. The new Maple Leaf Lounge at FRA was beautiful! The food was fresh and plentiful power outlets were readily available spacious and the showers were excellent. The lounge is right on top of the departure gate resulting in a easy process to board the plane. Flew a 777. Pods were clean FA's were attentive and pleasant bathrooms were clean food was excellent for an airline and flight was uneventful (the way it should be). I am *A Gold. Fly AC mostly and most flights are pretty boring. Flights arrive and depart on time. Only one time in the past 12 months did my flights get cancelled or delayed. In this single case Air Canada had me rebooked quickly.,8th May 2015,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,123

1222,Air Canada customer review,J Tydeman,Not Verified,Flew LHR to Toronto. Food was fairly good as was drinks service. Crew moderately friendly but not overly. Didn't look like they enjoyed their jobs. Legroom was good in economy. Boarding was good. Check in at LHR all self service and decidedly rude staff who would be better employed actually printing luggage labels etc than offering blunt and rather patronising advice to confused passengers.

1223,Air Canada customer review,J Fang,Not Verified,"Three flights on Air Canada: first flight was YYJ-YYC - a Bombardier Q400 Propeller Plane. It was surprisingly quiet and smooth for a propeller plane as I sat as far away as possible from the engines at the very last row. Cabin crew acceptable but no food offered on this flight. Next leg: YYC-FRA on an Airbus 330 - cabin crew on this flight were atrocious. Food was literally thrown on passengers tray tables. Serving portions were very small. The food which was offered was disgusting - the tomato pasta dish was extremely unappetizing. And the ""continental breakfast"" was a small piece of cake and a yoghurt shake - it was hardly a snack let alone a breakfast. Cabin crew disappeared after the meal service not to be seen again until before landing in FRA. Final leg: YYZ to YYJ onboard an Airbus 320. Seats uncomfortable - my neck became sore about an hour or so into the flight. Again no complimentary food offered on this five and a half hour flight.

1224,Air Canada customer review,Y Cho,Not Verified,LGA-YYZ-HND. I tried to reserve my seat on their online service in advance but what I saw was only their sorry page and I couldn't process any more for my seat request. When I checked-in at LGA they provided me another boarding pass for my connecting flight. I asked them to reserve a front side seat by aisle but they said they could not reserve any seats for my connecting flight at LGA. When I landed at YYZ I stopped at their counter for transferring passengers to reserve my seat but amazingly they said they couldn't do that just before the departing time. Just before my flight started boarding they changed my boarding pass and my seat was between aisle and window seats. I have asked them to give me another seat but they answered they can't do that because the flight was full. I don't know why I couldn't request my seat in advance at LGA and transfer counter at YYZ.,1st May 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,1,3,3,0,0,2,123
1225,Air Canada customer review,K Shilnikova,Not Verified,Our HND-YYZ flight was 12 hours long so it's pretty important to fly with a good airline.

1226,Air Canada customer review,Donald Schwentker,Not Verified,I have just returned from a trip to Japan from Washington D.C. (DCA) to Tokyo Narita (NRT) on Air Canada flying DCA to YYZ to YVR to NRT. I returned from Tokyo Haneda (HND) via YYZ to DCA. Flight 1175 from YYZ to YVR was horrible - a 777 with 10-across cattle-car seating. Never again! Flight 3 from YVR to NRT was a great disappointment. Poor food (no taste and meagre portions) and a lacklustre cabin crew - lazy and not helpful. I had decided never to select Air Canada again (and was dreading the return flight) however Flight 6 from HND to YYZ (also a 777) had 9-across seating and a much better cabin crew. The ratings below reflect my AC006 experience AC1175 and AC003 would get poor ratings in virtually every category - even the Inflight Entertainment kept shutting off the map I was interested in watching.,30th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,5,3,4,0,0,4,123

Get to the airport at 10am for a noon flight. While in the check-in line somebody mentions the flight is delayed - by 12 hours! No call no warning no SMS ahead of time. Terrible customer service. Only one SAS guy capable of handling re-bookings. It was painfully slow. The 4 out of 5 ""Staff Service"" is for the lone AC employee I saw who did her best to calm people in the line down. Even my Trip-It Pro app didn't get any update feeds from AC about this flight. Shameful!

1228,Air Canada customer review,Marc Belanger,Not Verified,I flew out of Hong Kong to Toronto. I tried to book my seat online as offered by the Air Canada website 24 hours before my flight but the system would not allow me to do so. I was sick with the flu and requested to get an aisle seat 5 hours before my flight at Hong Kong airport. I was then told that the airplane was overbooked and that no aisle seats were available. I was told to go to the Air Canada counter to request one. To my great surprise their is no Air Canada counter in Hong Kong airport. I was then told to go to my gate and ask the personnel there which I did and they offered an end of the plane seat without a working TV. This was unacceptable for a 14 hour flight. I was then told to keep my mouth shut and keep the seat that was originally assigned to me. I travel for a living and this kind of service I have never seen before not even from discount airlines like AirAsia or Cebu Pacific. Next time I will know better and save some money by booking with a discount airline from which I can get the same service or better.,30th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,2,0,0,1,123
1229,Air Canada customer review,Kylie McNamara,Not Verified,After reading lots of negative reviews I was a bit nervous about flying with Air Canada! We have just returned from a 5 week holiday flying with Air Canada all the way through from Sydney-Vancouver-San Francisco-New York- Toronto-Tel Aviv and back again. We got quite a reasonable airfare and when I consider each of the flights we took over the duration of our stay I have to say that overall I have no real complaints. We had no delays to any of our flights no flight schedule changes no issues whatsoever. All of the staff including ground staff and flight attendants were pleasant and helpful and we had no negative interactions. Staff were lenient on a couple of occasions without baggage allowance and we never waited long at the check in counters. Long haul flights no matter which airline are generally arduous and uncomfortable but Air Canada was certainly not the worst airline we have ever flown. The food was a little hit and miss but then it is extraordinarily difficult to cater meals for everyone also we tended to always eat a proper sit down meal at the airport before boarding a long flight so we often just skipped the first meal anyhow. If Air Canada offers a similarly well priced fare for our next holiday we would definitely consider using them again.,28th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,3,0,0,4,123
1230,Air Canada customer review,Alan Petten,Not Verified,YUL-FRA April 2015. A330 was in good shape.

1232,Air Canada customer review,J Patry,Not Verified,Flew YDF-YYZ-PVG in Economy. Although I usually check-in online I did so at the airport since it is a small airport and I had luggage to check through to Shanghai. Staff were friendly and efficient. The first flight was an A319 from Deer Lake NL to Toronto which was comfortable and had a great selection on the AVOD. There was food for purchase and complimentary drinks. For the Toronto-Shanghai flight boarding was relatively efficient despite being a full flight. Take off was on time and the same AVOD was available. Seats although small were comfortable. Beverage service began 45 minutes after take off accompanied by a small bag of pretzels. Supper was served approximately 1.5 hours after take off which consisted of either a pork or chicken option. I had the chicken in cream sauce with roasted potato carrot and green bean. Also each tray had a corn and iceberg lettuce salad a white bun and brownie for dessert. It was quite decent for airline food and certainly not the worst I've had travelling. The wine selection was decent too. At the halfway point a Nissin cup of noodles were served with a chicken finger sandwich on white bread with a pack of biscuits. Finally there for breakfast there was a choice between congee or eggs and sausage. I elected for the mushroom and chicken congee which was quite good. It was accompanied by melon and a white bun with jam and butter. Overall it was a good experience and the flight arrived smoothly and promptly in China,27th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,5,0,0,5,124

1234,Air Canada customer review,Silva Dirlandes,Not Verified,My wife and I just arrived this morning on AC flight AC99 from Rio de Janeiro Brazil to Toronto. The seats were very small and cramped but being in economy class we couldn't say much. The big Surprise came when the attendant brought our Kosher meal for both dinner and breakfast for us to open the seal. We were shocked with the portions. They were so small and only 4 tiny items for dinner and less for breakfast this morning. Even when Passover was over 3 weeks ago now we still got Passover meals for our dinner and breakfast. I called customer service today because our daughter is flying tomorrow with the same AC flight to see if something could be done in order to avoid old food for her and the answer was that whatever it is designed for her to eat it is already there for tomorrow night's dinner and they couldn't do anything. I'll definitely think twice in a different alternative next flight.,23rd April 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,0,0,1,124
1235,Air Canada customer review,Robert Sandall,Not Verified,I flew from Victoria BC via Vancouver (AC 854) to London on 17th April 2015 at 18.40 hrs. The plane from Vancouver a Boeing 777-300 appeared new. The seating in economy was 10 abreast in the configuration 3-4-3. It was the worst flight I have experienced and I am a seasoned traveller. They have clearly added extra seats on these planes. I suspect the new Premium Economy cabin this plane has was added at the expense of space in Economy. It is unforgivable to subject economy class passengers to these new cramped conditions. Whilst people are getting bigger Air Canada sees fit to make the space provided smaller. On top of that the crew on my flight did and others have made the comment the bare minimum required and all without a smile! To treat passengers as if they are an inconvenience to their day is astonishing? The way the food is disgusting! A dollop of salad stale brownie and a dish of sludge which was masquerading as vegetarian Shepherds Pie! I also fly often to Toronto in planes with 2-5-2 configuration and that is more comfortable sadly the FAs and the good are still rubbish. If they change the configuration of those planes I will never fly Air Canada again.,22nd April 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,4,0,0,3,124
1236,Air Canada customer review,T Eldem,Not Verified,YUL-YVR-YUL both legs on a tired looking A330-300. I checked in online and had carry-on luggage only so did not have any interaction with the check-in staff. Used the Maple Leaf Lounge on the domestic side in Montreal which is in dire need of a facelift and expansion as it tends to get very crowded at peak hours. Boarding was smooth and both flights left the gate and arrived on time. The pods are showing their age with worn-out and scuffed sections. Cabin lighting was dim and did not facilitate an airy environment. On-board service was typical AC style with FA's doing the absolute minimum required of them. Food and beverage choices were OK but it is time for an upgraded menu as they have had the same choices on transcontinental flights in Business Class for the past 4 years. IFE had a reasonable selection of movies but the sound quality was not the best even with my own noise- cancelling headphones. Washrooms like the aircraft itself looked old and run-down leaving the passengers with the impression that they were dirty. Air Canada prides itself in being voted the best North American Airline for several years in a row which I believe is giving them a totally false sense of accomplishment by comparing them to US carriers which are widely acknowledged as being inferior to Middle Eastern and Asian carriers. Although AC has made some progress in recent years uplifting its image and improving its service its progress has now stalled which if left unattended will push them back into the same mediocrity as the US carriers. It is time for them to start setting the bar higher and striving for a higher standard of service by looking to full-service Asian and Middle Eastern carriers as examples to follow.,19th April 2015,,Business Class,,,2,2,2,2,0,0,2,124
1237,Air Canada customer review,C Davis,Not Verified,I live in Cleveland and fly to Paris twice a year. I fly Air Canada through Toronto. Yesterday my flight from Paris was delayed by an hour making my chance of making connecting flight to Cleveland very slim. I went to the Air Canada desk to try and get a seat on a later flight and the customer service agent helped me make the earlier flight by walking me to the front of the customs line the (to me unnecessary) security line and then the immigration line. Without her I would have had to wait an additional 2 hours.,19th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,0,0,4,124
1238,Air Canada customer review,Claudio Rallo,Not Verified,I flew AMS-LHR-YOW on April 2nd and return on April 12th. Both were BA/AC interline flights. The BA flights and the transits at London Heathrow from T5 to T2 and vice versa proceeded very smoothly. Now my comments on my experience with Air Canada on this trip: Air Canada uses the Boeing 767-300ER between YOW and LHR. Despite this plane showing its age it's always a very sturdy and reliable plane no wonder that many airlines are still using them regularly on long haul routes. On my outbound flight the captain gave accurate cockpit announcements and staff members on both flights were very attentive and professional. Food snacks and refreshments were plentifully provided throughout the flights. My only issue is with the seats which were uncomfortable and there was very little legroom. Otherwise the meals were decent by airplane food standards and Air Canada offers a great inflight entertainment service keeping you busy on a 7-hour flight. I travel to Canada at least a couple of times a year and previously I used KLM travelling to Ottawa with a stopover at YUL. The route I took with Air Canada this time works out better for me personally and overall I am quite well satisfied with this airline. Will use them again in the future.,19th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,4,3,5,0,0,4,124
1239,Air Canada customer review,German Gardeazabal,Not Verified,I have to say that Air Canada is the only Continental North American airline offering Premium Economy for some long haul flights and is very competitive with some Asian airlines that offer this cabin and I have to thank to AC for this. Despite the amazing good service and private cabin the comfort is something that is not quite the best. The front seat row 12 on the Dreamliner 787-8 is missing the leg support and relax as all other Asia/Pacific airlines such CX NH JL QF BR which has superior seat comfort and welcoming Champagne as well not only water and juice as AC offers. The food is very good and the drinks are well served 10 min once we are airborne. Flight Crew is very friendly and keep someone at the 'food bar' ready to help you with a drink or snack such as cookies during the entire flight. My flights were YVR-PEK on March 24 returning on Apr 2. Thank you Air Canada for stepping over your all other North American Airlines with this service without removing the good service on regular economy.,16th April 2015,,Premium Economy,,,3,4,4,5,0,0,5,124
1240,Air Canada customer review,Holly Byerly,Not Verified,"Flew from Sydney Australia to Vancouver on Air Canada and was truly a miserable experience. I'm a petite person and was miserably cramped in a small seat the food was disgusting and the most of the staff acted like those of us in economy class were an imposition. Two women who chatted loudly for 12 of the 14-hour predominately evening flight were not asked to lower their voices so that others could sleep the in-service entertainment a small screen inserted in the back of the seat ahead of us was dark and virtually impossible to see and although staff did pick up trash after meals they didn't after serving various beverages so we were left sitting in rubbish for the duration of the flight. Complaining seemed pointless in light of the persevering misery of the overall experience; I and most of my fellow passengers just took it all in stride. I will never (at least wittingly or willingly) fly Air Canada again. When I got home a Canadian friend said ""You flew Air Canada? Sorry! They're terrible!""

No smile or help from the attendants (all over-head compartments were occupied by their equipment). Pillow and blanket: basic quality. Food: hot chicken low quality salad and cake.

1242,Air Canada customer review,D Hu,Not Verified,AC63 - YVR to ICN. Flight was delayed because of malfunctioning A/C. Plane had left the gate and had to return. The total delay was over 2 hrs because of strong headwinds. The plane was immaculate as it was one of Air Canada's new B787-800s. The service was good but there was no 2nd option for meals on that flight-we were all served the same meal. Air Canada's new inflight entertainment system is incredibly responsive and has a great user interface. It is by far the best system I've experienced on a plane. It kept me occupied for the entire flight. The armrest controls on the other hand could have used some additional thought as it was placed on the surface of the armrest rather than the side and resulted in frequent accidental presses. Many people pressed the attendant call button or the overhead light unintentionally by resting their elbows on the buttons.,14th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,5,0,0,4,125
1243,Air Canada customer review,Linda Routledge,Not Verified,YYZ-PEK - March 20 - April 11 - The staff who work for Air Canada must be really unhappy in their jobs - no smiles here.

1244,Air Canada customer review,O Rubenstein,Not Verified,YUL-YYZ-HKG-YYZ-YUL A320/B777. Typical of AC flights were late or delayed despite the weather being ok. Outbound YYZ-HKG flight had obnoxious disappearing FAs combined with a malfunctioning IFE. F&B was nothing special but edible. An average flight. Return HKG-YYZ-YUL flights were distinguished by the worst departure and arrival delays of all the flights and terrible catering. The J class main meal of beef was overcooked and inedible as it was so tough. Breakfast highlight was dried out croissants and a glop of salty greasy noodles. FAs on this segment were professional efficient and polite. AC's IFE featuring small screens with poor resolution has a limited library of interesting titles. It remained closed for most of my flights unlike my flights on CX or BR which offer current films along with an interesting selection of Asian films. AC's international films have a lot of Bollywood and are of little interest to China/Japan route customers. I really look forward to the Asian film selection on AC's higher end competitor EVA. The AC IFE equipment is at least 5 years out of date along with the uncomfortable worn out pods. The equipment was somewhat cleaner than usual although AC still refuses to provide headrest covers like the Asian airlines do. Not the most hygienic approach to air travel. The new blankets are a welcome change. The lavs were the usual basic AC setup so very different than those found on Asian carriers. Boarding procedures have drastically improved with the implementation of zones although many pax still do not understand the cabin baggage size and weight limits. AC has an inconsistent approach to this issue and I could see that some economy cabin pax were going to be made uncomfortable by a few selfish people. Desk agents on all segments were polite and pleasant to deal with. Baggage delivery at Canadian airports was slow as usual. Considering the fare paid which was higher than the AC competitors I don't think I received good value for my purchase. AC offers an expensive inconsistent product with unreliable on time performance.,12th April 2015,,Business Class,,,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,125

The service was outstanding and the attention to details also surprisingly good. I was impressed by the attention to service and the passengers exhibited by the staff and overall Air Canada has certainly improved their intercontinental Business Class product.

1247,Air Canada customer review,Mike Tigg,Not Verified,YYZ-MSY on Air Canada and MSY-YYZ via EWR on United. Both legs in business class. Outbound to MSY on AC on cramped old CRA equipment. Not good enough for a three hour flight. Food was mediocre. Pieces of cold chicken thrown about on a few lettuce leaves. Overhead bins too tiny for carry-on resulting in bags being shoved under seats wherever possible by an overwhelmed and stressed attendant. Disgraceful considering the usurious fare charged by AC. Inbound on United was most surprisingly day compared to night. Roomy and comfortable 320 Airbus attentive attendants serving an open bar drink before takeoff and during flight to Newark excellent lunch provided with soup and chicken salad or a cheeseburger and potato salad as choices. Flight from EWR to YYZ also well managed even though only a one hour trip and comfortable on an Embraer with proper sized bins for hand luggage and spacious business class seating. On top of which return fare nearly half of what AC charged which is reason we flew United and from now on shall continue to do so in lieu of AC who have lowered their standards horrifically.,8th April 2015,,Business Class,,,2,3,2,3,0,0,1,125
1248,Air Canada customer review,S Gurjal,Not Verified,My husband and I flew to Vancouver on Air Canada from Newark on March 11 2015. We were to take off at 6.30pm and reach Vancouver by 9.53pm At 5.45pm there was an announcement asking for eight volunteers to get off loaded. We started boarding at 6.20. At 7.00pm there was an announcement that an off loaded passenger's baggage couldn't be located. At 8.00 they located it. The pilot then said he would need to refuel! Finally it was 8.30pm when we were finally on our way. We reached Vancouver by 11.30. Our return on Monday March 16th was equally terrible. Our flight was scheduled to leave Vancouver at 9.10am and reach Montreal by 4.54pm. Our connection to Newark was to take off at 6.10. The flight didn't take off till almost 11am. In fact we had left the gate when the pilot announced a weight balance problem and brought the plane back to the gate to refuel. At 12.30pm when service was finally rendered there were no lunch items - only breakfast items to be purchased. When we landed in Montreal it was past 5.15pm. Even though we had informed the crew that we had to make an international connection we got no assistance. Our seats were at the back and it took 10 minutes to get out. There was no ground crew to assist us. We had expected a cart that would take us from the domestic to the international terminal for a quick transfer. On foot it was a very long walk. After quickly completing immigration and customs we reached the gate by 6.04. The gate had just closed - ironic that the only Air Canada flight our entire trip that took off on time was that one! They put us on an Air Canada flight to LaGuardia adding three hours of ground transportation to our already exhausting day. That flight left half an hour late reaching around 9.00pm. We had to buy tickets for ground transportation to take us from LGA to Newark since our car was at Newark airport's long term parking. We reached the car park by midnight and finally arriving home early next morning! There was no apology from Air Canada even though it was the airline's fault. Further there was no attempt by the airline in any tangible way to make the bad experience a little more bearable.,3rd April 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,3,0,0,1,125
1249,Air Canada customer review,C Goldhill,Not Verified,Flight AC1844 on 23rd March 2015. 1) Flight due to take 1.5 hours but was 2 hours late. No apology offered. 2) I was a business class customer and due to be flying at lunchtime. No sandwiches were available in lounge at 2pm when we were due to be eating lunch on the plane. 3) Staff were extremely rude and unhelpful on both outgoing and incoming flights. 4) Same menu was served on plane for both legs of journey - 1 week apart.,29th March 2015,,Business Class,,,2,1,1,2,0,0,1,125
1250,Air Canada customer review,L Sullivan,Not Verified,Toronto to Ft Lauderdale via Montreal / return trip. Exorbitant price for an advance ticket only to find I was on standby for all 4 legs of the trip. Ticketing in Ft Lauderdale was atrocious! Kiosks didn't function properly lines were chaotic only 2 ticket agents available during spring break week and they were slow as can be. They stuck the baggage tags on the wrong tickets. Even the agent at the gate was fed up. I am submitting this review with her encouragement!,28th March 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,2,1,2,0,0,2,126
1251,Air Canada customer review,T Mark,Not Verified,Just flew AC6 and AC5 and I have to say that AC are the worst airline I have been on. The flight attendants are awful they never smile do not show any interest in their work and never use the words please and thank you and overall as a passenger I was made to feel like a burden to them. The plane was dirty upon boarding AC5 many of the seats were still reclined meaning that safety protocol for landing had not been adhered to. The in-flight route map lasts 20 minutes then crashes the food is awful and the speed of service appalling. The trash from dinner was sat on my tray table for 55 minutes as the flight attendants were all eating and chatting in the gallery. As a regular NH flyer I feel the code-share between AC and NH reflects badly on NH who are outstanding. First and last time to fly AC - an airline who are really let down by the worst flight attendants I have seen.,28th March 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,2,0,0,3,126
1252,Air Canada customer review,G Moore,Not Verified,PBI-YYZ-YOW on the Tuesday after March break. Both flights on time first on an A321 and the second on an embraer e-190. Both aircraft clean with an excellent choice of IFE for regional flights. The crews were professional if a little aloof; seat comfort and legroom was as good as it gets in economy. Air Canada is a solid airline and (at least regionally) does not deserve their bad reputation.,28th March 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,5,0,0,4,126
1253,Air Canada customer review,N Gagne,Not Verified,Just finished my flight from EZE to YQB with Air Canada's two cabin 777. It was a wonderful flight. After the stop in Santiago the fresh crew took care of all details. Although SCL is not the best kitchen in AC's network the food was good. The service was efficient but not rushed. It allowed for the cabin to go in sleep mode fairly early on in the flight. I don't understand AC's decision to move away from the two class config pods. They are comfortable and for me 6'1 a welcome lie flat experience. Slept very well and woke up just in time for breakfast. Hats off for this 5 star crew! Seems to me AC is working hard on maintaining and potentially increasing their service standards.,26th March 2015,,Business Class,,,5,5,4,4,0,0,5,126
1254,Air Canada customer review,C Kim,Not Verified,Just flew from Seoul to Vancouver and then onwards to Los Angeles less than 24 hours ago. Flight was fine except that I'm not too sure if the four star rating is justified - I'd say its more like 3.5. Tried the 787 for the first time and I have to say that the lighting system is brilliant as it eases the level of brightness on the eyes whenever the light is turned on by going from dark to bright gradually. Another added bonus to flying with Air Canada is that it makes US entry easy since customs and immigration is cleared in Canada thus not having to deal with the debacle that is met at US airports. As for the in flight experience the food wasn't half bad but the seating and entertainment can see some improvements. The seats were not ergonomically designed and no matter what position I would turn my body I just couldn't manage to sleep due to the discomfort and entertainment although extensive did not have a decent selection of films to choose from.,23rd March 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,4,0,0,3,126
1255,Air Canada customer review,M Brereton,Not Verified,Outbound Sydney to Vancouver (Sat March 14th) due to turbulence no tea of coffee - except that the flight was very smooth for the hours in which no tea / coffee could be served. Wed March 18th Vancouver to Sydney announced on take off that hot water machines not working so no tea/coffee for the 14 hour flight. I don't believe it! Service very poor. I almost wonder if staff are working to rule due to some kind of dispute. Went to the galley three times in the flight to serve myself some water.

1256,Air Canada customer review,D Field,Not Verified,Took my first 787 flight on Feb 27 from Beijing to Vancouver. Thoroughly enjoyable with great service. I prefer the new pods to the old type. Will be doing the same flight soon in Premium Economy which looks very inviting and I did try out the PE seats. I also checked the economy cabin and I am not about to experience it. On their downward spiral on customer comfort this is a high density cabin to be avoided. I am supportive of open skies as until there is some real competition in Canada on product and prices both AC and Westjet (which I no longer fly) will keep squeezing the passenger on everything.,17th March 2015,,Business Class,,,4,5,3,3,0,0,3,126
1257,Air Canada customer review,M Bernstein,Not Verified,"Surprisingly decent flights from YWG-YYC-OGG. Flights on time from YWG delayed slightly from YYC-OGG. Air Canada 767-300er (non rouge) is a solid air craft. Surprised however that the crew did not offer a free meal on a 7 hour international flight. Passengers we're restless about that. Decent pitch for a guy who is 6""4 such as myself. The better of the two AVOD systems in Canada for sure. Only gripe was an extended period of ""turbulence"" where there was no communication many passengers stood up to use the facilities as did I. About 3-4 hours into the flight. The senior flight attendant rudely remarked ""you know the seatbelt sign is on!"" Not exactly highly service oriented. But still worth the trip from Calgary. This route for sure will be a rouge flight soon in which case avoid like the plague. But for standard AC mainline about as expected nothing wrong but a few things missing. Far superior to United service to Maui for example through Denver.",9th March 2015,,Premium Economy,,,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,126
1258,Air Canada customer review,F Atkin,Not Verified,Last Sunday travelling as a legit full fare paying J class pax from LAX-YYZ-YWG. AC792 arrives late from LAX into YYZ but still there is an hour to connect to AC271 YYZ-YWG. Canada Customs press a magic button which allow my 2 checked bags to go directly to my connecting flight when I announce I am returning from a vacation in Hawaii. I proceed to my domestic gate to board AC271 and while in line am redirected by the gate agent to see her colleague at the gate desk. I am told I have been taken off the flight as my 2 checked bags won't make the flight? I am offered a Y class seat on the last flight of the night with a suggestion by the gate agent that the stars may align and I may get to ride in the cabin I paid for. Sent unceremoniously to the Maple Leaf lounge to await my fate I am granted access to the exclusive club even though I have now been stripped of my upper class status. Within an hour I am presented with a J class boarding pass for the last flight of the night to YWG. Was I bamboozled by my favourite mother country flag carrier giving away my original highly prized seat 1A on a Jungle jet back to Winnipeg on AC271? My 2 checked bags went through YYZ without me even seeing them and they were secured for travel from LAX-YYZ-YWG on company aircraft yet I was denied boarding AC271 based on the fact that my bags would not make the flight? Was I being punished for flying Delta from HNL-LAX in order to avoid flying Rouge? Or was my seat given away prematurely to a company commuter? Even when you pay full fare J class you have to role with the punches.,4th March 2015,,Business Class,,,3,2,3,5,0,0,3,126
1259,Air Canada customer review,John Pillsbury,Not Verified,On Friday Feb 13 2015 my wife and I were to leave Boston for Toronto enroute to Tokyo to see family. Our plane was 45 minutes late arriving in Boston but were we reassured that making our connecting flights would not be an issue. After we boarded in Boston we sat for another 35 minutes before the plane left the gate. Needless to say we missed our connecting flight to Tokyo by 5 minutes. When we got to Toronto Pearson airport-which is the most unfriendly and confusing airport we have ever had the misfortune to be in-we got to our gate the plane was still there with the bridge still at the plane but we were told the gate was closed. After I informed them that if they could sit our plane for 35 minutes at the gate in Boston without moving then that would give us time to board our flight. We were rudely informed that that was not possible and were directed to go to customer service. Air Canada told us that they could not get us to Tokyo that day and that we would need to spend the night in Toronto. They paid for the room and some of our meals but the customer service was horrible. No attempts were made to book us with another airline as we have had happen in a similar situation in the past. Two years United screwed up and caused us to miss a flight to Hawaii but they bent over backwards and got us there only one hour later than our original time. Air Canada could take a few pointers from the competition. I will never fly Air Canada again and I will never fly into Toronto Pearson again. They both have much to learn about customer service.,4th March 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,2,0,0,2,126

1261,Air Canada customer review,A Barnes,Not Verified,Traveling Air Canada was the worst experience I have had. The agents were extremely rude and unhelpful in Toronto Pearson airport.

Ended up renting a car in Montreal and driving to Quebec City where our bags were lost for another day. 3 hour process turned into 24 hours and we never arrived at our destination via Air Canada.

1263,Air Canada customer review,D Epstein,Not Verified,ORD-YUL-CDG in economy on 25/26th Jan 15. Our first flight with Air Canada was a shuttle from Chicago to Montreal where our flight to Paris CDG was our next leg. In fact due to late arrival we missed our connection and had to stay 24 hours in Montreal. Everything was handled perfectly by AC staff who gave us vouchers for a 4* hotel nearby and for meals. We could get our checked luggage back and were immediately handed our boarding pass for the following day. All being very smooth in a quiet airport. The following day our 6 hours flight to Paris by itself was OK with various standards. Aircraft (777-300) with a clean cabin without decoration the blue colour of seats being the only colour. The seats were standard without footrests. A good VOD system with recent movies especially for French speaking passengers. This is for the good side but when you see the fancy earphones handed over you will regret not to have yours with you. The weak side starts with no newspapers or magazines available. Cabin crew obviously well trained and working efficiently. I am sorry that uniforms are so plain. No efforts from attendants to look like attendants and participate to the dream of flying like many other airlines. Meals were frankly just edible. A small salad where I am still looking for dressing chicken with bulgur (totally bland) and a so-called chocolate cake retaining from chocolate only the colour! A standard rate for the table wine offered graciously and for the rolls quite correct for an airline. A bad rate for the low quality plastic cutlery. It seems North American carriers do like plastic very much. Before landing we had a slice of cake (good) with hot drinks served in a tumbler. All in all we were expecting more from an Airline claiming to be for the 5th time the best airline in North America. It is true that US competitors are so bad but European airlines are much better and Emirates/Asian carriers are on another planet where passengers are taken care of.,24th February 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,3,1,4,0,0,3,127

1265,Air Canada customer review,Williams Temidayo,Not Verified,Air Canada is by far the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly with. I was forced to sit through a 8 hour flight from London to Toronto with no TV entertainment because their screen was faulty while other passengers around me had their TVs working. The staff on board thought offering me newspapers was a good alternative to not having TV entertainment which we all pay for as part of ticket costs! Its like asking me to eat carrots for 8 hours rather than giving me the solid meal I was told I would receive as part of the service. Unbelievable.,18th February 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,127
1266,Air Canada customer review,Ian M Fraser,Not Verified,Planned to travel with Air Canada (Toronto to Ixtapa) on January 31st for a one week vacation in Mexico (given the short duration time was of the essence). Arrived at Pearson in good time and was advised the flight would be delayed 15 minutes (acceptable but just!). On arrival at departure gate loading of plane was initiated then minutes later an announcement that the loaded passengers would have to be deplaned as there as a maintenance issue (not a weather or staffing concern!). First observation: why does Air Canada insist on placing faulty equipment in the loading gate? Don't think it is too much to ask to have a functional plane ready and available to load at prescribed time! Worse the 'delay' (over the next six hours) lead to a flight cancellation at about 7pm. Many families with small children are then expected to deal with the development one that was obviously known hours earlier but not shared. Air Canada's behaviour in this regard is consistent - it would be only a common courtesy to advise on such matters - honestly and in a timely fashion - so passengers can make other arrangements. But no the airline drags the waiting times out until no other options are available. As a result a plane-load of angry passengers are at the 'customer service' desk to make alternate (hotel and air travel) arrangements only to learn that the staff there have not been advised of the situation. As a result more time is lost (almost an hour) as harried staff scramble to address the issue making other arrangements etc. without being prepared in advance for the onslaught with answers ready and alternate course of action determined! Again incredibly poor planning from this passengers perspective. Finally we were advised that we were scheduled on a flight the next morning and this one actually took off as scheduled and on time. Remarkably as for this passenger it was the first Air Canada flight (out of the most recent five flights flown with the airline) that was neither 'cancelled' or 'delayed' on departure (I reference flights between March 2014 and January 2015 in this regard: Denver SFO Nashville Miami and Ixtapa (1)). As a result my 'trust' in Air Canada is at an all-time low as they simply cannot be relied upon to reliably meet their contractual obligations. Worse no one seems to care about the stress and inconvenience caused by their unreliability. Wherever possible I would strongly suggest finding other airlines to utilize if and when possible.,18th February 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,4,0,0,2,127
1267,Air Canada customer review,Mo Adama,Not Verified,Flew YYZ-YVR-NRT return. Very disappointing business class service really third rate compared to other international airlines such as Cathay Pacific or Singapore. Boarding the flight from Vancouver to Toronto was disorganized and there was no clear line for business class passengers had to speak up to get on the plane. Deboarding was just as bad and no priority deboarding for the business class passengers. The only reason I'd fly with Air Canada is my belief that they have well-trained pilots and well-maintained fleet. Again that could just be a perception and other Canadian carriers may have the same standards.,11th February 2015,,Business Class,,,2,2,2,3,0,0,2,127

1270,Air Canada customer review,J Pritchat,Not Verified,I fly Air Canada quite frequently for work between YVR (Vancouver) and YYC (Calgary). I switched over from WestJet after I had a bad experience of multiple late and delayed flights and I could not be happier! Flying with Air Canada in Canada is much better then flying with WestJet (from my own personal experience). I enjoy flying on the smaller ERJ 190s compared to a 737 on this route; less cramped and not as many people on board. I find that domestic check in with Air Canada moves quite smoothly with no real issues or problems. I have also noticed that Air Canada's prices are sometimes cheaper then WestJet (surprising I know). From my own personal experience I have to say the overall customer experience with Air Canada has improved quite a lot in the last number of years.

We have booked another flight on WestJet at a cost of $740. I doubt if my husband will ever fly Air Canada again. We were not the only people complaining about the lack of leg room.

1273,Air Canada customer review,Mehdi Tahuri,Not Verified,Flew AC015 from Toronto to Hong Kong. Prior to travel had to wait 25-35 minutes on long distance call to add special request. On board: They failed to provide the special meal. They were trying to blame it on me since I paid $120 for preferred seat. The flight attendant said she'll see what can be brought from Business class leftovers. They even failed at that so they brought me the side items of the meal (without the entree) which was awful. This was way too inferior to another European airline which I flew with last month. If that wasn't enough they ran out of water half way and at least one toilet got clogged. You couldn't wash your hands in the other ones! The Captain came on the speakers apologizing and explaining that the alternative would have been to land in USSR six hours ago but that they decided to carry on for many reasons. None was mentioned. Horrible experience overall. I'd avoid Air Canada on my future travels whenever I can.,21st January 2015,,Economy Class,,,4,2,1,1,0,0,1,128

1276,Air Canada customer review,W Jacob,Not Verified,Living in Canada one must either fly with Air Canada or West Jet domestically and have to use one of them for the first part of any international flight. Air Canada never fails to disappoint with their service it is dismal to say the least. They charge for everything from earphones to food on domestic flights. Food on international flights is also poor. I recently had breakfast on Thai Airways Singapore Airways and Air Canada. The meal was almost identical in all three instances but the portion size and taste was significantly better on Thai and Singapore. The dinner meals on Air Canada were also less than impressive compared to the Thai and Singapore. On more than 1 occasion my personal TV didn't work properly and flights nearly always depart late. I have flown nearly all types of Air Canada aircraft (787 777 767 A321 (A320) A330) and while their larger aircraft are comfortable their older smaller aircraft are uncomfortable. In the event there is a problem and you need to contact someone be prepared to be put on hold for at least 1 hour.

1277,Air Canada customer review,D Mauer,Not Verified,Weather delayed Montreal to Toronto flight on 01/04/15. Air Canada did nothing to rebook missed connections for people. My husband spent 2 hours on hold finally got to speak with an agent and walked her through the booking process because he had already found a flight with an open seat she was amazed there was even a seat on the plane. He started the 3 hour drive to Minneapolis where the Toronto connection was bound. 2 hours later Air Canada cancelled the flight from Toronto to Minneapolis with no explanation - and it wasn't weather. Worse yet they made one or two garbled announcements and that was it. My wife and the elderly lady she tried to assist were finally told they could only leave the secured gate area with an escort through locked doors gee guess Air Canada gate agents should have mentioned this when they cancelled the flight and told everyone waiting they would have to leave the gate area. Rude gate agents no directions on what to do to rebook just left their stranded passengers to figure it out for themselves.,19th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,128
1278,Air Canada customer review,Ahmad Nadim,Not Verified,In July last year my wife and I travelled from Manchester UK to Toronto. Queuing for check in: I am a wheelchair user. I don't demand it but most airlines let wheelchair users join a fast queue for Check in. I don't demand it but have to say that it is a polite gesture this polite gesture was missing with Air Canada. Check in: was chaotic with long queues and check in staff seemed all over the place. It took us almost 1.5 hrs to reach the check in counter only to see that half the check in counters were not even open. Boarding: As we arrived at the boarding gate and were showed boarding passes we realised that me and my wife had been allocated seats a few rows apart. To the credit of airline staff they quickly sorted this out and put us in premium economy. Although they told us that we will have to pay for the entertainment and food but once we were on board they did not charge us. Arrival in Toronto: Because I need assistance to get on and off the plane I have to wait until everyone has gone. Usually it takes 5 to 10 minutes but this time it took over 45 minutes for assistance to arrive because no one knew that a passenger needed assistance to disembark the plane. Please note that I had requested the check in staff in Manchester twice to make sure that people know in Toronto that I will need assistance. Luggage collection: Upset and frustrated we arrived in the lounge to collect our suitcase. Everyone from our flight had collected luggage and gone. No carousel information was available. First we tried to look for our suitcase and then I found Air Canada customer service counter and queued to ask which carousel our suitcase would have arrived at. All of this took another hour and half almost but still no staff was available to help. Eventually we found our suitcase near one carousel. This was the first time we travelled with Air Canada and will be the last.,19th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,2,3,2,0,0,1,128

Return trip was just as awful with the standard cramped seats and to top it off they messed up my meal (dietary requirements) not once but twice. The meal was given to the wrong passenger and when I spoke to the flight attendant all I got was an apology that they did not have anything else to offer. Then they repeat the mistake again during snack time.

1282,Air Canada customer review,P Yu,Not Verified,Flew from Calgary to Narita before Christmas 2014 on a 767 economy. Food was horrible! Came back on a 787 to Vancouver. After 10 days in Japan I actually found the food on 787 to be good. Controls on the armrest are sensitive to the point of annoying. Slight elbow movement may trigger the entertainment screen to shut off or the overhead light to turn on or off. I usually put my carry-on with fragile stuff in front of me after seeing how they shove in the huge carry-ons with force. Should consider restricting the seat incline to a smaller angle. It's not fun have a seat in front of your face during a 10-hour flight.,14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,4,0,0,4,129
1283,Air Canada customer review,M LaPrairie,Not Verified,YOW-DCA on an RJ. Seat 1A (single cabin). No lounge access in YOW for US-bound passengers but was allowed to go through security to the AC domestic lounge. Very nice lounge with great view of the airfield good drinks and food (salads soups rolls snacks). Check-in agent for US departures for Star Alliance gold could not have been nicer or more obliging phoning around to see if I could use the domestic lounge. Flight delayed about 50 mins due to late arrival of the aircraft. On board the one FA was very nice and efficient. Captain kept everyone updated.,14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,3,0,0,4,129
1284,Air Canada customer review,G Patton,Not Verified,Yesterday I flew from London to Toronto on a Boeing 767 which is basically a lovely plane. My complaints about this flight which apply to every Air Canada flight I've taken in the past few years are principally about: a) terribly uncomfortable seats and b) the lousiest food anywhere in the air. a) Seat comfort. Who on earth designs a seat that is so short that it puts unbearable pressure on the middle of the back of one's thighs? And this wasn't a Rouge flight either but a mainline experience. Why do they torture us with seats that are so close together that our knees are grinding against the seat in front? I'm a very average sized person - 5'10 and 170 pounds - so there is no excuse why the seat should not be comfortable. And let's not even mention the fact that the available tilt is about 4 inches from front to back with zero lumbar support. b) Long ago back in the 70's when I was a university student I used to wonder why the cafeteria food was so terrible when Air Canada could server a very decent meal at 35000 feet in a pressurized aluminium tube. In those days I routinely asked if they had any leftover meals on transatlantic flights because the food was actually quite enjoyable. Not any more. It's just awful. Virtually inedible except when one is starving. And yesterday's flight was the very worst. Recently I had the opportunity to fly to from and around Central America on the Colombian airline Avianca. Although the aircraft themselves weren't new the in-flight experience and especially the food was exceptional. The difference between the food service on Air Canada and Avianca is night and day. Avianca has delicious food and interesting menus served with a smile. Air Canada has heated cardboard served reasonably efficiently but without any enthusiasm by flight attendants in dowdy uniforms. I'll be looking for alternative carriers to Air Canada from now on. Among North American airlines Delta gets my vote at the moment.,14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,2,0,0,1,129
1285,Air Canada customer review,R Hoare,Not Verified,"Flew to the UK on a new ""Dreamliner"". Should be renamed a Squashliner. Air Canada has to be congratulated for cramming more seats into this aircraft than ever before. I paid a premium for the extra legroom seats behind business class. The aisle seat is placed right in the centre of the entry to the aisle of business class. This results in constant crashing of the food and beverage carts into the seat even though the new carts are narrower than those used on other aircraft. If the video screen which is in the armrest is used the situation is even worse. everybody trying to negotiate their way through the aircraft hits the screen. The crew were excellent and very aware of the problem of overcrowding on this aircraft. The 787 is a nice aircraft quiet but not comfortable in the Air Canada layout.",14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,5,4,3,0,0,2,129
1286,Air Canada customer review,Tim Piper,Not Verified,"My wife was scheduled to fly from Montreal (YUL) to Toronto (YZZ) and then connecting to Minneapolis (MSP) on 01/04/15. Weather and de-icing delays kept passengers in the plane for over 3 hours waiting to depart from Montreal. She missed her connection in Toronto. Air Canada took no action during the 4 hour delay to rebook anyone who was going to miss their connecting flights. In the meantime AC's ""customer service"" number was continually busy. Stayed on hold for another 2 hours and finally got through to a booking agent. Got my wife rebooked for a later flight out of Toronto to MSP and wondered why this wasn't being handled internally by Air Canada. I notified my wife and she was able to check in and get to the gate in plenty of time for the later flight. I had a 3 hour drive to Minneapolis to pick her up. Just as I was getting on the interstate she text me saying that AC said there would be a slight delay but that it would be short. Halfway to Minneapolis I got another text saying that AC had cancelled the flight without explanation and were providing no assistance to stranded passengers. The gate agents were rude and simply told people they couldn't help them and that they would have to leave the gate area. What they failed to tell the stranded passengers was that they couldn't leave the secured area without assistance from AC or security. It was just by pure luck that my wife stopped an agent from another airline who explained that the passengers would need to be ""let out"" through a locked door so they could return to the ticketing area and start the entire process of booking a flight over again. Flights get delayed and cancelled that's just the way air travel has become. However Air Canada's total lack of regard for their passengers well being after a flight is cancelled was echoed by everyone flying Air Canada. The rudeness of the gate agents after the flight was cancelled and the empty promises of booking agents to assist stranded passengers was unparalleled. When the passengers were finally able to get to the ticketing area for Air Canada there were five queues with five functional computer terminals there were hundreds of people waiting in the five lines - but not a single Air Canada employee to be seen despite Air Canada's promises of assistance.",14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,129
1287,Air Canada customer review,K Kumar,Not Verified,LHR to YYZ on 12 Dec. The flight was 4.5 hours late food was awful and then to top it off my luggage was left behind at LHR. Return trip was just as awful with the standard cramped seats and to top it off they messed up my meal (dietary requirements) not once but twice. The meal was given to the wrong passenger and when I spoke to the flight attendant all I got was an apology that they did not have anything else to offer. Then they repeat the mistake again during snack time. If it weren't for the virtual monopoly on the LHR-YYZ I would not be travelling with AC ever again.,14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,0,0,1,129
1288,Air Canada customer review,C Napier,Not Verified,Belfast - Montreal return. A rather unpleasant experience from start to finish. Best part of the trip was the flight to London only because that was on a codeshare flight with another airline. Air Canada flight from London to Halifax was on an old and dirty 767. Crew were rude and didn't have time for customers. Entertainment system dated and food was well below par of other airlines. Halifax to Montreal on a E175 and crew did bare minimum to pass their time onboard and again were just as unpleasant as the previous lot. My luggage got left in Halifax even though I had a 3 hour layover was reunited with my bags 2 days later with no apology offered when I returned to the airport to pick up lost luggage. Return flights were no better. Customer service and even customer interaction at the airport and on the aircraft isn't their strong point. I am heading back to Montreal in a few weeks time Air Canada are the cheapest but I have booked more expensive tickets via another airline so I can avoid flying Air Canada.,11th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,2,0,0,4,129
1289,Air Canada customer review,S Constance,Not Verified,Air Canada continually disappoints. Their loyalty program is worthless unless you want to cash in your points for a flight with 3 connections and even then you still have to pay $500 in taxes and fees along with your points. Flew to Jamaica on AC Rouge as part of a vacation package. Worst plane ever nice flight attendants that had to deal with the airlines inability to properly stock food and beverage (they ran out of everything about a half way through the service so half the plane had nothing to eat). Both outgoing and return flights were an hour late in arriving. Other than some of their non Rouge planes being nice and the entertainment in those planes being pretty solid there is not much good to say about this overpriced airline and their ability to deliver flights on time and in a satisfactory manner.,11th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,3,1,3,0,0,1,129
1290,Air Canada customer review,M Lawrence,Not Verified,Our fight at YYZ was originally delayed 35 minutes. However when the plane never arrived it was bumped to a 1:25 minute delay. After everyone boarded the plane there was an additional 25 minute delay to upgrade the computer system with landing information about our destination. We were offered free $3 earphones for the inconvenience. I normally wouldn't write such a negative review based on one experience but this is after being silent for several similar past experiences.,5th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,130
1291,Air Canada customer review,Christopher Walden,Not Verified,Flew YVR - LHR - YVR in Executive first. The so called new suite on Air Canada's Boeing 777 on select routes only must be one of the worst business class seats ever designed. I was seated in 2D. When you first arrive at your seat you think that you have plenty of space. However once seated you soon feel very claustrophobic. The large arm rest on the left is made up by the very small armrest on the right which puts you very close to your neighbour. Just sitting normally ones left arm/hand naturally rests on the seat controls so without warning your seat starts moving. The tray table has a 3 phase deployment which could only be done by cabin crew. All passengers battled. Your seat can only be upright or flat with no in between settings. When flat the massage function on my seat would not turn off. It would only turn off when upright. When flat your feet go under the seat in front leaving no room to move your legs around. It's like laying in a coffin. There is no ground area for any luggage and no space for your duvet or pillow (which you are not allowed at your feet for take off / landing). All in all a very badly designed seat. I wasn't a great fan of the previous pod system but it is far better than this current design. I would rather have flown BA even with the backward facing seats. Service was good and the staff cannot be blamed for the tools they have been given to work with. I have had better comfort and sleep traveling in Economy.,5th January 2015,,Business Class,,,1,5,4,3,0,0,3,130
1292,Air Canada customer review,V Pinones,Not Verified,This is the worst experience I've had I understand it's New Years and its busy which is why I think they should be a little more organized. I will never fly Air Canada and would never recommend it. We came at 3 am to check in for our 6am flight yes we don't get served. Still waiting while they take the Toronto flight. We have been standing and still standing here to check in our luggage. They have no customer services. We have a big group with boxes and carts. We have been told to go in 3 different lines since 2 hrs ago yet still waiting. I would never fly this airline ever again.,5th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,130
1293,Air Canada customer review,Lien John,Not Verified,B787 AC004 NRT to YVR Dec 22nd 2014 seat 3G. Offered menu choices soon after take off by meal time we were informed that they had run out of the beef option. In Business class no less! My wife didn't want the alternatives and therefore declined to eat. I told the attendant to give the beef to her and I'll have the salmon. The service director explained that even though we were full paying passengers there is a priority system there in terms of menu items. They had to take care of their Elite Super Elite and Million Milers before the others. We found this unbelievable in terms of a company policy. How much can it cost Air Canada to provide sufficient meal choices in J class? As it turned out the beef tenderloin was anything but tender or tasty. The rest of the flight was uneventful the seat was fairly comfortable and converted to flat bed easily. Turbulence prevented hot drinks service but that wasn't anyone's fault. The movie and TV choices were pretty pathetic compared to having just come off a Singapore Airlines business class segment from SIN to NRT. There was no comparison in the level of service the comfort and width of the seat and the meals. In fact when I mentioned this to the AC service director she candidly admitted that she was aware that they did not match up to SQ or Emirates in J class. I felt sorry for her as she was attentive a hard worker and did her best but had to comply with a restrictive mandate working for an airline that has a lot of room to improve.,31st December 2014,,Business Class,,,4,4,2,3,0,0,4,130
1294,Air Canada customer review,Christopher Neep,Not Verified,Flew on AC 855 from LHR to YVR on December. 22 in economy. Crew attentive throughout flight. Lots of water juice and ice cream between meals. Lunch better than many offerings in other airlines' economy cabins. Wine quality well above average. Air Canada seem to have finally fixed their often faulty IFE system. Plenty of music and film choices though latest film selections could have been better. The downside? Like other airlines Air Canada has reconfigured economy seating with four seats now in the centre section. As a results seats and aisles are very narrow. Not too uncomfortable for a daytime flight but I'd find it impossible to sleep on an overnight flight.,29th December 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,4,0,0,4,130
1295,Air Canada customer review,J Markoff,Not Verified,Flew from Toronto to San Jose CR via Houston. Trying to leave YYZ Air Canada could not provide more than one person at the gate and then did not have a flight crew available. The delays were not notified in advance and we could not cancel hotel reservations. We missed connecting flight in Houston but were informed that United was holding flight for us. When we arrived at United counter they informed us that they told AC that flight was not held so we returned to AC counter only to find it closed. We then went looking for baggage and were told that the baggage was never included on flight out and then hung up on us. We have now spent five days waiting for baggage with no information provided to us or partner carriers very unusual. Typical response is apology with no further information or update nor return call of any sort. Complete incompetence exhibited by AC throughout this process and direct and outright lies in regards to continued correspondence with the firm. I will never fly with this airline again.,22nd December 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,130
1296,Air Canada customer review,Janet Johnson,Not Verified,Service has deteriorated every year in the last 5 years. The staff at the airport representing Air Canada treat customers with disdain and do nothing to communicate delays etc. We are always left to guess about delays since no announcements are made. There is absolutely no courtesy shown towards regular customers. We are treated in a way that shows that our business is not valued at all. I only fly Air Canada because I have no choice where I live. I am happy WestJet will finally be providing service out of my local airport. At least then I will be able to experience some courtesy and satisfaction when I have to fly anywhere.,22nd December 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,3,3,0,0,1,130
1297,Air Canada customer review,Zach Zmuda,Not Verified,"Decided a few years ago to commit to flying with Air Canada (live in Toronto) as I knew I would be traveling quite a bit to London for work and for consistency of booking and to take advantage of the loyalty program I wanted to stick with one airline. As a disclaimer for these flights I was not ""overly"" concerned about pricing but rather timing and comfort. That said I definitely wasn't willing to pay insane prices. In my opinion and for how I was traveling Air Canada has been by far the best airline I have traveled with (I have not flown airlines such as Emirates as they don't offer the routes I need but of course I have heard good things). There is no question that a direct AC flight to your destination might be more expensive than flying with another airline with one or 2 connections. If you are not too worried about spending more time traveling and in result save a few bucks - then go for it. That said where AC really shines is comfort and from my experiences service. The no. 1 reason I fly AC is comfort. In economy there is a good amount of leg room. If you disagree try flying United in row 30 and then report back. Secondly there is free in-flight entertainment in every seat. The flight from Heathrow to Toronto will fly by with a movie and some TV shows. Thirdly the first class cabin on the YYZ-LHR route was incredible. I am a light sleeper and also 6'2"" and even with the decent economy seats in AC economy I still have trouble sleeping. As most of the YYZ to LHR flights are red-eyes and I need to be rested for meetings when I arrive - I often spent the extra money (or later on upgrade credits) to fly in business. I don't care if Emirates gives you a hot towel to exfoliate your face halfway through the flight what AC provided was a great lay-flat bed in a semi-private pod and I got a good 6 hours of sleep. It was invaluable. Where the true service came through was on the return. When getting a ride back to LHR there was crazy traffic on the M1. Airlines recommend arriving to LHR three hours before your flight. I arrived 45 mins before the flight. The AC staff were so helpful in getting me checked in and somehow got me on a golf cart and I was driven through the bowels of the airport escorted through security back on another golf cart that drove through random hallways passed luggage belts arriving right at the gate just before they closed the doors. Sure maybe some of that treatment was because I was booked in the first class cabin but I have had equally great experiences when booked in economy.",22nd December 2014,,First Class,,,5,4,3,5,0,0,4,130
1298,Air Canada customer review,Jan Cafferty,Not Verified,From start to finish my experience of Air Canada was one I don't want to repeat unfortunately. From them changing planes and not notifying me so the exit row seat I'd paid for to accommodate my 6ft 5 son was no longer available to the poor quality food on the plane (the vegetarian tea time snack consisted of a banana plum and Satsuma) and the functional but not welcoming staff and the very narrow seat on the 787 all in all a very disappointing experience. The only plus points I could find were the online check in and bag drop and the entertainment system on the 787.I would best describe Air Canada as a transatlantic budget airline but maybe I've been spoilt by travelling with far superior airlines in economy class in the past.,22nd December 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,3,0,0,1,130
1299,Air Canada customer review,V Gligorov,Not Verified,Just flew Paris-Montreal round trip for work in economy on 777-300ERs (both ways).

1300,Air Canada customer review,A Mark,Not Verified,London Heathrow to Vancouver via Toronto. Was looking forward to trying the 787 Dreamliner. Well what a disappointment. Firstly Air Canada somehow managed to offload us from the flight in London and this was only realised when they scanned our boarding cards at the gate. In the meantime Air Canada had sold our assigned seats to someone else and after much stress we were eventually given seats right at the back of the plane. No apology from any of the crew on board for the stress caused by a problem entirely their own fault. Underwhelmed by the 787 looks like any other new aircraft on the inside the seating is narrow due to the tight 9 across seating and the plane seemed quite noisy. This accompanied by the typically forgettable Air Canada service meant I left that plane with nothing good to say about Air Canada. Connection at Toronto was tight due to our late running inbound flight. Our 777 to Vancouver had been swapped from a high density one to a standard one with less seats you can imagine the chaos at the gate as the flight was now oversold. Again more seating changes for us and we were now seated in economy middle aisle instead of Premium Economy. Overall a totally unpleasant experience made more stressful by Air Canada at every stage. I don't need this when I fly and will now take my business elsewhere.,18th December 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,3,0,0,1,131
1301,Air Canada customer review,Annette Schmidt-Schweda,Not Verified,On Dec 6th our scheduled flight from Vancouver to Nanaimo took off as planned. We had been informed that Nanaimo Airport has a critical density of fog but that they would try to get everybody across. The landing could not be done due to the fog so they flew us back to Vancouver. By that time it was close to midnight. All passengers were asked to go to a nearby service desk. Every single party received a voucher for the Fairmont Airport Hotel and everybody was re-booked for the first flight to Nanaimo the next morning. Very smooth!

1303,Air Canada customer review,Cheryl Buchiw,Not Verified,Travelled on flight AC033 Vancouver to Sydney on October 31. Again staff were rude and unhelpful. Inflight entertainment did not work in our row of seats for entire flight - 16 hours is a long time to listen to aircraft noise and read a book. Seat belt sign again used to excess and it did mean that tea and coffee were never served as no hot beverages when seat belt sign is on. Staff kept one toilet for their own use by claiming it was 'out of order'. One member of staff was extremely rude and loud actually shouting instructions at passengers.

To leave at 11.50 pm boarded at 12.One hour delay while computer is programmed for Heathrow then 30 minute delay because of shift change. New seat cut off circulation in the back of my legs and I had the sensation of being crammed in to make more money. The entertainment centre controls are in the arm rest right where one would put their elbow. All night the passenger beside me was turning on and off his and my system and overhead lights. If I put my elbow on the arm rest I would do the same to the passenger beside me. Try sitting for 8 hours with no place to put your arms and light flashing on and off as you tried to sleep.

1313,Air Canada customer review,G Cassie,Not Verified,"YVR to NRT. First off you can fly YVR to Haneda on ANA. I recommend that route. Narita is such a hassle even on the ""direct"" NEX train it takes an hour into Tokyo and that is after the long haul flight after Customs after waiting for a train before you transfer again in Tokyo or even if your hotel is near a station make the 900 meter walk out of Tokyo Central or Shinagawa. (I am not exaggerating. The time it takes to wheel your luggage from the NEX at Central to the lobby at the Shangri-La is nearly 20 minutes and that's when the station is relatively quiet.) AC was using an older aircraft on this route and it wasn't really too noticeable until we flew back on something much better (Cathay). The biz config in AC with their very comfortable if a tad firm lie flat seats afford privacy and ensure a good rest. The AV system is good although the screens aren't too big. Crew was extremely attentive and very friendly. One even had a sense of humour! The first meal was half decent quite good. The second a breakfast was mediocre. I find the ""second"" meal on AC long haul flights is always a letdown. The wine on AC could be better. On Cathay they were serving better champagne a wonderful Saint Veran a superb Gruner Vetliner and a lot of other wines that had obviously been tested at 39000 feet. Most AC wines just don't make the cut at the altitude. This was a points flight but if I was paying I would definitely choose ANA.",20th November 2014,,Business Class,,,4,5,3,4,0,0,3,132
1314,Air Canada customer review,J Waterman,Not Verified,Toronto to London - I booked 3 seats and had them pre-assigned so we could all sit together. This was confirmed and the seats allocated. When I arrived at the plane the crew had split our seats up and would not change other seating so we could sit together. My 4 year old was initially sat alone next to a stranger. The result was that I could not go to the bathroom with my son without leaving my baby. I could not change my baby without leaving my son alone - my wife was 30 odd rows away. The stewardesses would not help us get food from bags (which were all with my wife because we were meant to be sat together). When I complained through customer relations I was told that it is always challenging travelling with children.

I'm 5'4"" and 135 pounds so if I can't fit in a seat - something is drastically wrong! And I couldn't get comfortable - the flights to/from Europe were each 12 hours of misery. How greedy could AC be as to try to fit in that many seats? The plane is already super-efficient - so having an aisle seat is awful - you will constantly get your elbows arms and feet banged by the flight attendants. Add to that - the washrooms are so small I couldn't even fit in. And the toilet seats refuse to stay up!

What a contrast - a first class carrier and a no frills one. All Air NZ flights treated passengers as if they were valued and always gave them something (even a 75 min flight got wine and cheese). A 5hr one with AC got you a cup of lukewarm coffee. ANZ staff chatted and joked with customers. Air Canada's just went through the motions. It really felt like a ""bus run"". It was was so disappointing to see how far Canada's national carrier has sunk. I will avoid them at all costs in the future - too bad ANZ doesn't fly everywhere from Canada.",17th November 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,3,0,0,1,132
1317,Air Canada customer review,C Roberts,Not Verified,Vancouver-Beijing in Business Class. Plane had the older pod seats which are comfortable but starting to show their age and could use some touch-up. Outstanding crew with every member very friendly and professional along with superior catering and generous amounts of good wines. Lights dimmed perhaps a bit quickly to encourage us to go to sleep but on the whole a much better business class experience than most other airlines.,17th November 2014,,Business Class,,,4,5,5,4,0,0,5,132
1318,Air Canada customer review,M John,Not Verified,"I recently travelled on AC from Vancouver to Heathrow and back. I had a premium economy seat booked on the outbound leg and an economy seat for the return but had purchased a preferred seat. I upgraded to business class on both legs on check in for $900 on the way out and 900 Pounds on the way back! AC have managed to hide their business check-in at YVR and LHR I had to ask both times where it was. At YVR its basically in the Domestic check- in section of the airport. The check-in agent mentioned that I had a good seat (4A) which is a single seat by itself. My heart sank a little when she mentioned that the aircraft had a 'high density' configuration. Airline speak for a plane where they have crammed in more seats. Onboard I found the new business seating terrible clearly designed for short narrow people. Once the seat is in lay flat mode your legs go into a narrow gap under the seat in front of you. I'm 6' and 230lbs and had a few centimetres of room to the side and above before my lower legs were hitting the sides of the available space. The seat feels narrower than before making the whole thing coffin like. The pods were much better and offered more privacy. This particular seat had excessively large armrests some of that space would have been better used to widen the seat. Where the seat controls are positioned you will hit them when you use the armrests in the regular fashion causing the seat to move when you don't want it to. When I mentioned to one of the cabin crew about the seat comfort he said ""I know we're ripping them out'. Clearly gone are the days of the $600 or less last minute upgrade to business. I don't think that the new charges justify what you get. Otherwise the staff were friendly enough the food was ok and the cabin was too hot. If you happen to do an upgrade to business from economy and paid for an economy cabin preferred seat email them to get your $90 back otherwise you wont get it. Finally I had a look behind the curtain at Premium Economy certainly didn't look like the pictures on the AC website which gives the impression that its somewhat separate from regular economy it isn't. Although I make an internal connection within the UK from Heathrow I will be giving KLM a try next time to Amsterdam where onward connections are still good. Their business upgrades are typically $500.",17th November 2014,,Business Class,,,2,3,3,4,0,0,3,132
1319,Air Canada customer review,Corner Geo,Not Verified,A return flight from Vancouver to Heathrow was very disappointing in many ways. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. During the long overnight flight the cabin was ridiculously and uncomfortably warm making sleep difficult there was an unsettled noisy baby on board to whose parents the flight crew offered no help and due to the stupid design of the seats incorporating lights and volume controls in the top of the arm rests it was quite impossible to rest ones arms or support oneself on these armrests. The delay however then created the greatest problems. Passengers with onward connections were told to contact Air Canada ground crew. We were assured we had been rebooked on a later BA flight to Edinburgh. There was not actually enough time to transfer to the flight in Terminal 5 but that in itself did not matter as we (and many other passengers) had been misled. None of us had been rebooked. Fortunately BA did sort out the mess without any assistance from Air Canada who had gone incommunicado and would not answer calls. We were fortunate that we were able to complete our journey that day. I am not certain all our fellow abandoned passengers were so lucky. I am afraid I could never trust Air Canada in the future.,11th November 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,2,2,0,0,3,132

1321,Air Canada customer review,Patrick McHugh,Not Verified,Today I was on a connecting flight with Air Canada from Boston to Vancouver through Toronto. The flight to Toronto was delayed and I asked whether I would be able to make the connection which I was assured I would. On landing in Toronto I made it to my connecting gate 20 minutes before takeoff and they had already removed me from the flight. Colleagues who arrived at the gate behind me were not removed from the flight. The explanation from customer service was that they were in business class and I was flying economy.

1322,Air Canada customer review,Mitchell Gordon,Not Verified,Toronto to Fort Lauderdale on October 27 with October 28 return. All flights on time. Aircraft clean and attendants do their job. Several water runs in addition to the usual beverage service. IFE quite decent. Not sure why Air Canada typically assigns a middle seat hoping to coerce you into buying an upgraded better seat.

1323,Air Canada customer review,P Rubenstein,Not Verified,AC through its contract partner Sky Regional YUL-YTZ (RT DH4 service). Although the equipment is old and the seating is cramped the overall flight experience was good. Advance check-in eliminated the hassle of YUL check-in and aside from a change in gate at departure everything went smoothly. Changing my departure on the return was easily done at the airport by a pleasant agent. I used the MLL in YUL courtesy of my Elite status. Although the lounge was crowded I was surprised by the improved range of food available. The MLL agent was polite and smiling (in the past they have been grouchy). Significant improvement at the YUL MLL in the last year. The departure area at YTZ is shared with Porter and is run down shabby and crowded. Both flights were nearly on time despite weather conditions. This was my first use of AC at YTZ in many years as I have been a loyal client of Porter. I gave AC a try because of my displeasure with my past Porter flights specifically the deterioration in service and on time performance. AC is just as good if not better than Porter on this route and with my FF status the AC experience was superior overall. AC is excellent when there are no IROPS no baggage and it is a short haul flight.,31st October 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,4,3,1,0,0,5,133
1324,Air Canada customer review,V Grewal,Not Verified,"I've flown AC before but luckily with folks that work with the airline thus a very favorable fare (tax only). Our most recent trip to Europe included a one-way flight from YVR to LAX for a 3-day layover for some fun in the sun. We asked to be moved up to an earlier flight as we were meeting some friends in LA so I contacted AC reservations three times and got three different stories. I decided to go to the airport the day off early and asked where I could change my flight. This is where the unfriendly cold staff interactions begin. When I asked where I could go to change my booking the lady proceeded to hold up a finger telling me to pause while she scrutinized carry on bag sizes for passengers then when she ""had a moment"" pointed in the general direction of a service desk and said ""there!"". A short walk and 10 minute wait in the line led me to another miserable lady who told me I should be in the international terminal since I'm flying to LA but in this case ""she'd make an exception"". I proceeded to ask her if there were two different operating companies for domestic versus US flights knowing the answer. The lady gave a short and concise ""no"" response and proceeded to tap away at her computer for minutes without looking up or saying a word. Her next words were to give me the outrageous ""change fee"" costs which I paid to get the ordeal over with. When I asked about the policy change she said didn't give any explanation other than ""that's the way it is now."" Inflight the staff were even worse. We flew on a ""Rouge"" flight which I guess is their budget full-staffed sub. Long story short the worst airline I've flown! From their front-end service staff to in-flight crew all around miserable people. I'm never flying with them again.

I was stuck with a large woman next to me a seat leg directly in front of where my feet needed to go and the leg had an entertainment control box on either side of it in effect requiring me to have no legs as there was nowhere to put my feet. If I had been a 6 foot+ man I would have been miserable. The new leather seats are harder than the old ones and are very uncomfortable. The screen can no longer be angled. The service was the one thing which has not changed it was as dreadful as it has always been. We will after 25 years of flying with AC be looking for a new carrier. The two 9 hour+ flights were pure misery.,31st October 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,2,2,0,0,3,133

1329,Air Canada customer review,D Boothroyd,Not Verified,AC 1173 to Vancouver on October 12 and returned to Toronto on AC 152 October 19. It appears that AC flight attendants hate their job and are only too pleased to show this to the passengers. On the first flight one of the attendants was barely civil. Return flight a repeat performance with a different attendant. At boarding time I wondered why no attendant was welcoming passengers or being helpful at the rear of the plane where we were seated. An attendant was there alright seated in her position and doing absolutely nothing. During the flight she managed to serve the drinks before sitting down in the last row to read eat and watch a movie. Her colleague was somewhat more professional. I am wondering however what has happened to civility to say nothing of service. These people don't seem to understand that they are there for the passengers not the other way around. One sees nothing like it on the other major Canadian airline in Europe or in Asia where flight attendants still consider friendliness and service as part of their job. Appropriate training and supervision is definitely in order.,28th October 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,2,0,0,2,133

On my way to the airport I got a text saying my connecting flight was cancelled and they had to re-route us. I was to arrive at my destination at 0930 in the morning and didn't get there until 5 in the evening. I had a 2 hour wait in one airport and a 3 hour wait in another. This was not acceptable to me as I was travelling with my husband who is a dialysis patient and had meds with him that had to be kept cold also my 75 year old mother who has problems walking. Not once did we get an apology or even a food voucher to eat. Thankfully we were only travelling from Deer Lake to Toronto - usually a 2.5 hour flight but took us 11 hours.

1332,Air Canada customer review,McKelvie Donald,Not Verified,Having had two bad experiences with Air Canada I will never fly with them again. First issue: Booked to depart Vancouver at 0800 on 1 Aug 14 on a flight to Toronto we arrived at the airport early. Checked our bags and got our boarding passes however on the boarding pass it did not have a seat allocation but indicated that this would be done at the gate no problem. As we had cleared security and it was now only 0620 we casually got a coffee and wandered up to the gate. On arrival at the gate my wife went to the desk to get our seat allocation only to be berated by the desk person who told her they had been paging us we didn't hear anything. He then informed her that our flight was boarding. We said that our flight wasn't until 0800 he then told us that our original flight was delayed until 1000 and we had been placed on the one now departing. Obviously had we not arrived early we would have been waiting around until 1000. All well and good but why weren't we informed of the change when we check in? Arriving early in Toronto messed with our booked transport which caused a few anxious moments and we had to get a taxi however thanks to Viator we got a refund on our transport booking. Second issue: The next flight was from Toronto to Seattle (E90) 3 Aug 14. On this fight the cabin crew showed a complete disregard for the comfort of the passengers. We were seated in the second last row of seats and were very conscious of people using the toilet no problem. However the flight had a number of turbulence issues and at one stage the line up for the toilet was half way up the cabin. On a number of occasions people asked if they could use the toilet at the front of the aircraft and this was denied. It did not help matters with the seatbelt sign going on and off. At one stage a young girl who had been waiting a long time got to the front of the line only to be told to go back and put her shoes on. I have never been told to put my shoes on. Anyway all that said I will never fly Air Canada again. The first impression is always the best and lasting impression.,22nd October 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,1,1,1,0,0,3,134
1333,Air Canada customer review,Tania Rindel,Not Verified,Arrived at Halifax Airport on Saturday morning 04.30 for our family trip to Cancun. Check in was slow with only one attendant taking her time. After scanning our passports the Air Canada attendant told us that because my husband and son has the same first names it causes problems for their system. She was very rude about the whole situation! Arrived in Toronto where the attendants were more professional and friendly. Inflight was uncomfortable and tight which can be expected with economy class. Overall flights were OK but we will avoid flying Air Canada again.,12th October 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,0,0,2,134
1334,Air Canada customer review,Golding Jenny,Not Verified,I travelled from London Heathrow to Calgary return. Check in was speedy. There wasn't a queue to get through security so the Fast Track didn't make much difference. The lounge at Heathrow was spacious and comfortable and the food selection was fine. The 1:2:1 seat formation ensured privacy and the lie flat seat was comfortable and just wide enough. I'm 5ft 7in but if you were much taller or bigger it would be a tight squeeze. The food selection was ok fish meat or veggie but all choices were available. My salmon was well cooked and the vegetables were hot and not overcooked. There was a choice of 2 white wines one of which was not available due to all stock being used on the incoming sector! Come on I'm sure LHR has a pretty good catering set up. I don't drink Chardonnay or red wine (3 choices) so I had to drink beer instead. This really is unacceptable in Business Class. And why no Canadian wines? The service on both sectors was efficient and friendly so no complaints there. I can't comment on inflight entertainment as I didn't use it. The WC's were shocking. They smelt like a public urinal with wet floor and paper stuck to the floor - and this was 1 hour into the flight. They obviously hadn't been cleaned at the turnaround. The lounge at Calgary is being refurbished so it was crowded and not very comfortable. All the chairs had rips or worn arms so the refurb is well overdue. The flight back was ok I got my wine this time! The toiletries supplied were an unknown brand and not worth bothering with very basic. For the amount of money paid for Business Class they could do better. It's more like Premium Economy except for lie flat beds. If the LHR/Calgary sector had Premium Economy I would have taken it. Next time I will try Canadian Affair (charter) Premium Economy. This was a leisure trip so expense was very important as I was paying! If Economy is well priced on Air Canada it may be worth it but not Business Class.,12th October 2014,,Business Class,,,4,4,3,1,0,0,3,134

I requested a pillow and a blanket for my son who was very sleepy as we had transited from UK the air crew rudely said to me that we have to pay for it I didn't mind paying but it is something unheard of. I travel so often but never asked to pay for these things even in the cheapest airlines in Europe like Ryanair EasyJet etc. I will never recommend Air Canada to anyone and will never fly with them again in the future.

1338,Air Canada customer review,D Bodtker,Not Verified,Over priced by a long shot. Due to the protection they get from the government they feel that it is their right to charge 1/3 more for flights.

1339,Air Canada customer review,R Tilling,Not Verified,"B777-300 Vancouver-London Heathrow 2 Sep 2014. The new business class seat is terrible - narrow short ridiculously sized and shaped. It's okay as a seat but I paid for a good night's sleep. Forget it! I'm 6ft 4 and when the seat turns into a bed it slides the lower half of your body into a tiny plastic coffin-like box with no room to move your legs at all. It wasn't long enough for me - so it wasn't humanly possible to lie down! As a result I arrived at LHR tired and irritable lacking the sleep I had needed and paid for. The cabin crew were brilliant but they told me that a lot of other business class passengers had complained about this new seat. It's also difficult to get the seat back up again from a thr ""bed"". My seat 2A on C-FIVO was also missing a flexible reading light. It is a reasonably new aircraft so why on earth was that missing? Basically Air Canada has decided to shove more seats in every class onto this aircraft at the expense of comfort and space and every passenger is short-changed as a result. The B777-300ER that normally takes 359 passengers is being converted to 458 passengers - mine was one of them. The passenger loses. I have read that it is a plan to reduce cost per seat by 15%. It is a total disgrace - avoid this aircraft at all costs. Air Canada used to be a great airline but it is heading downhill.

1341,Air Canada customer review,C Wu,Not Verified,"I assumed that a large country like Canada would be a safe bet for my trip to New York. On the way out staff were a slow and unhelpful but our main complaint was the food - we boarded at 12 so assumed lunch would be provided instead a 'light snack' was served at 2.30 and there was no meat option because they had already run out. Before landing we were served another 'light snack' which was the smallest wrap I have seen. On the way home our flight was delayed at LGA for over an hour with barely any communication until we could board. Onboard my sister asked the attendant if we would make our connection - he looked at our ticket and said probably not without any sympathy or conciliatory expression. When he gave us immigration cards my sister told him we didn't need them as we were only transferring. He said ""you might if you have to stay overnight in Canada"" - a possibility that had not yet been suggested to us and which was delivered in an incredibly flippant way considering we had told him we had important work engagements we needed to keep the next morning. When we got to Montreal we rushed to the connections gate where Air Canada staff who were supposed to guide us told us the plane wasn't waiting for us despite there still being time to make it. The rest of the evening was spent walking from end to end of the airport as Air Canada staff constantly referred you to different colleagues for help. In the end we had to stay overnight in Montreal wake up at 3 to fly back to Toronto and then on to New York arriving in London 12 hours after planned.

For Economy the leg room was OK compared to other airlines albeit still cramped. The staff were friendly and helpful. Entertainment system also OK. But the food! It is simply the worst quality I have ever encountered on a long haul flight and was so bad that I bought food from Subway in the airport to eat on the return flight. That turned out to be the right decision considering the quality on the return flight was as bad as on the outgoing flight.

1345,Air Canada customer review,D Mayoh,Not Verified,Flew from Honolulu to Vancouver economy class. Ground staff were helpful and reasonably friendly. The plane was a 767-300 and the seat was very uncomfortable as the padding in the middle of the seat had vanished over the years. The four stewardesses in my area must have been 60ish and not up to speed. One stewardess asked a passenger to get out of his seat and close the overhead bin as she had a bad back. Knowing that Air Canada did not serve meals domestically I checked online about international flights and it said that meals were served. None provided. During the flight I was offered a decent beverage twice and a couple of times the stewardess came by with a tacky plastic jug and served lukewarm water. I travel to and from Asia quite often and have never experienced such poor service on any other airline. I will absolutely go out of my way to avoid flying Air Canada again.,28th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,2,0,0,2,135
1346,Air Canada customer review,S Simpkins,Not Verified,Montreal YUL to Boston BOS on Air Canada Express CRJ100. Checked in online but still needed to use airport machines to print boarding cards and luggage tags assisted by pleasant AC staff. With this small aircraft you have to leave cabin cases at the door and they are returned to you on landing although there were the usual few passengers who decided this reasonable rule did not apply to them. Announcements in the air virtually inaudible because the FA held the microphone too close to her mouth and then shouted into it - training issue here. Drink and snack served on this short flight. Being a small aircraft it twitches a bit in flight so nervous flyers should be aware.

Air Canada staff were pleasant and efficient both in the air and on the ground although the boarding official was a bit sniffy when he found we were not business class passengers (in an all-economy aircraft!) and the flight left slightly late but arrived 30 mins early. Good service from AC but I will try to avoid that aircraft in future.,28th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,1,0,0,4,135
1348,Air Canada customer review,R Wu,Not Verified,We recently returned from New York La Guardia airport to London Heathrow. Our first flight was delayed which meant we missed our connecting flight to London. Both my sister and I missed several appointments - work for myself and registration for her PhD and meetings for my sister. It was also my sister's 25th birthday which is an extra detail but made the subsequent experience much worse to take. Our return flight included a connection at Montreal - the plane from New York was delayed and from the offset the staff on the plane were incredibly rude disengaged and unhelpful when we asked for advice and reassurance. The whole process was terribly managed - we arrived at the boarding gate in time to see our plane pull away from the gate - some better communications and we definitely could have boarded that flight with a five minute delay for the other passengers at most. We were then sent around the airport with cursory explanations and a lack of basic guidance - for example no one explained there was a shuttle bus to the hotel or even pointed us in the right direction. There was a lack of staff in the airport due to it being a bit later in the evening and we felt completely unguided in the process. I was stunned that a customer-focused service could have such a poor grasp of good communications and moreover just didn't seem to care about it's customers as well. We arrived in London 12 hours after our scheduled arrival time. Overall the process was poor in itself - bad food stingy amounts. When my sister asked if we would be served another meal the attendant smirked and said 'You could loosely call it a meal'. I'd never fly with Air Canada again.,24th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,1,0,0,2,135
1349,Air Canada customer review,Richard Moller,Not Verified,Flying from London Heathrow to Kingston Ontario is a tiring trip at the best of times flight delays on both legs due to “the late arrival of the aircraft from its previous destination” only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston.,24th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,4,2,3,0,0,2,135
1350,Air Canada customer review,P Magda,Not Verified,The worst long haul airline and I travel a lot but I am doomed and have been for last 15 years as it is the only direct connection between London UK and Halifax Nova Scotia. The price is outrageous the service is generally poor (even in business I don't find it super friendly) and it is the only long haul airline where I have to bring my own food when I fly economy. Also completely inefficient and useless systems if you want to book an end to end flight using different members of Star Alliance for different legs of the flight (if not in the same class). Every time I have to deal with them I have to grit my teeth.,24th September 2014,,Business Class,,,4,2,1,4,0,0,1,136
1351,Air Canada customer review,H Stephen,Not Verified,AC034 20 September. Just got off a 14 hour flight from Sydney and thought the crew was excellent. They were attentive continued cabin presence and friendly. I also thought the seat (even though a little warn) was better than other airlines like Malaysia Airlines A330. Very pleased with everything and well worth the price. Definitely a 7.5 out of 10.,24th September 2014,,Business Class,,,4,5,3,3,0,0,4,136
1352,Air Canada customer review,Richard Moller,Not Verified,Flying from Kingston Ontario to London Heathrow is a tiring trip at the best of times delays at the start when a plane needs additional time and maintenance to be flightworthy only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston. Due to maintenance issues the entertainment system on the Toronto to Heathrow leg had to be completely rebooted mid-flight making it unusable for about an hour. Luggage handling was slow and bags marked “Priority” were some of the last ones off. Since they are the only airline that flies out of Kingston it used to be worth the extra 30% on fairs for flights going outside of North America to fly Air Canada for the convenience but with chronic scheduling problems because of aged aircraft it is becoming less so.,24th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,4,3,1,0,0,2,136
1353,Air Canada customer review,Jim Mitchell,Not Verified,Over the last two years we have taken 31 flights. Of those flights 11 were on Air Canada and on 8 of those 11 there were either delays of more than two hours or cancellations. My most recent was on Air Canada YVR to YEG - the flight was cancelled and it created a great deal of confusion for Air Canada. First they would let us know about putting on other flights in 15 minutes half an hour later they were still confused and lost. They said they would give a lunch voucher but couldn't get them to print and that took 45 minutes. Finally a lunch voucher that would buy an airport pre-made airport sandwich. Back after lunch and sched on flight in another hour (now 2.5 hours later). This is very typical or even quite good service for this airline. Food and beverages - if you like a mini bag of pretzels and some juice or water or coffee then great. I only travel Air Canada when absolutely necessary.,19th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,3,0,0,1,136
1354,Air Canada customer review,Shannon Steve,Not Verified,Toronto - Tel Aviv - Toronto B787 Dreamliner. Executive First. Aircraft is superb and is now my favoured choice over the B777. Innovative numerous improvements in passenger comfort and convenience. Cabin staff really proud of the aircraft and it shows in their service. Flights left on time and arrived early. Concierge at Tel Aviv personally accompanied me to my seat (a first). Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience on both flights.

1355,Air Canada customer review,M Tan,Not Verified,I flew from Toronto to Tokyo on my way to Manila on 22 Oct and had the worst service experience I had in a long haul flight (12 hrs). I was seated at the window seat on several occasions I had a request for food water in the middle of the flight I pressed the attendant button waited more than 20 mins then an attendant went by and just went past no stopping on our side of the aisle and asking if anybody needed anything this happened in the middle of the flight when everyone was asleep so I didn't want to call out loudly but was waving my hands. This went on for 3 more attendant passes me before I was able to get the attention of an attendant. On the way back flying from Tokyo to Toronto I opted for an aisle seat thinking it was easier to get their attention it was but they were not the friendliest or most cordial I was asking for snacks in the middle of the long flight I was asked to go to the back myself to get pretzels and cookies. No more long haul Air Canada flights for me if I can avoid it.,18th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,136
1356,Air Canada customer review,Friesen Robert,Not Verified,I am a Star Alliance Gold Card holder and fly business class frequently. I just returned from a trip to Thailand and flew the Vancouver to Hong Kong leg (return) business class in their newly configured 777-300 series aircraft. The new business class seating arrangement on this aircraft is an unmitigated disaster. Where do I begin! It is primarily a 2-2-2 layout with 3 rows being 1-2-1. This single seat is only available to AC super elite members. So AC has decided that any other full fare business class travelers on this aircraft are not entitled to a single seat. Ridiculous. The tight seats are far too firm and narrow footwells make it impossible to properly stretch out and have a relaxing sleep. There is no storage area and materials used are cheap and do not even belong in a Premium Economy section. Window passengers do not have a clear access to the aisle. You have to climb over the other passenger. This is unacceptable in a business class in today's airline industry! I browsed through the Duty Free Magazine located in the seat pocket in front of each seat and asked the Flight Attendant if I could order something. She advised me that the configuration of this aircraft did not permit any duty free sales on board. No duty free on board when there is a duty free magazine located in every seat pocket! I will never fly on this aircraft again and my frequent flights to Asia will be on other Star Alliance carriers which are improving their business class product not reducing it to cattle car status such as AC.,18th September 2014,,Business Class,,,1,3,3,1,0,0,1,136
1357,Air Canada customer review,Jones Ian,Not Verified,Flew LHR to Vancouver Premium Economy on newish plane with different layout premium economy is no longer separated by a bulkhead and curtain so we had to put up with kids running up and down the aisles and noise. On top of this they messed up on our return flight from Calgary. No premium economy available so we chose the front two seats in economy they changed the plane last May didn't tell us so we lost the seats after a few calls to the call centre in India they refunded the charge for the so called premium seats but it's not a money issue we wanted the seats. Arrive at the airport and now we have to pay $70 for our third case that was FOC on the way out. We explained we would have booked it if we could but no joy they charged us. The only way to complain is to write to them apparently which we will for sure. Based on these issues I wouldn't recommend this airline.,18th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,2,3,3,0,0,3,136
1358,Air Canada customer review,D Gallant,Not Verified,On 14th Sept flew Air Canada express - Saskatoon to Vancouver on AC Express. Excellent service by flight attendants. The plane is starting to show its age. We then flew AC 47 to Honolulu. Here again the aircraft is showing its age. Our preferred seat 12 A and C has no window. Service was excellent. The flight attendants were older and were very professional. We learned that Air Canada Rouge is taking over this route in Mid Nov. and we will be returning on that flight in Dec. Our flight departed late however arrived in good time. We had problems stowing our carry on bag as bins were completely filled. Flight attendant did put our bag in a bin in Business Class.,18th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,5,0,0,4,136
1359,Air Canada customer review,Harrison Jason,Not Verified,A trip from home from Greece to Calgary resulted in arrival 41 hours after the scheduled time. Air Canada did not contact me once during this time only provided vague updates through the hotel staff. On the ensuing flight from Greece customers were still charged $10 rental fees to use the in-flight iPads despite being delayed more than a day and a half. Disgusting customer service and clearly poor plane maintenance practices. A good way to ruin a vacation is to fly with Air Canada.,17th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,136
1360,Air Canada customer review,Tangye Graeme,Not Verified,We had three short haul domestic flights with Air Canada - YVR to YYJ YYJ to YYC and YYC to YVR. One flight was on time one was 25 minutes late and the other was over an hour late. Minimal information was provided about the delays and most of that was obviously incorrect. Check-in at YYJ and YYC was simple and efficient but at YVR was terribly slow with only 2 bag drop desks open and huge queues. The overhead lockers on the YYC to YVR were inadequate leaving everyone a scamble to find space anywhere they could. I would give any other airline a try next time - Air Canada performance leaves much to be desired.,17th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,3,0,0,2,137
1361,Air Canada customer review,Tangye Graeme,Not Verified,LHR to YVR 777-300ER. Fairly new aircraft with everything clean and working as it should. Cabin crew were okay without being anything special. I found the staggered beds to be quite comfortable although if travelling alone it is better to avoid the pairs of seats near the window unless you want to climb over/be climbed over by a stranger. Food was okay but nothing special. Air Canada lounge at Heathrow was nice but the check-in process was poor. The premium desk was far removed from the economy kiosks with poor signage and the Air Canada roving ground staff lady that we dealt with did not help. It was only when we reached the bag drop desk after a long wait that we were told where we should have gone.,17th September 2014,,Business Class,,,4,3,3,3,0,0,3,137
1362,Air Canada customer review,E Wong,Not Verified,"On September 8 I boarded my connection flight scheduled to depart at 6.30pm from Calgary to London Heathrow but after boarding the pilot announces that there was a problem with the de-icing device. They spent hours trying to fix the problem but in the end the flight was canceled. By the time we walked out of the plane it was almost midnight. I understand that due to safety issues there was no choice but to cancel the flight but what I'm extremely upset about was the unhelpful staff and lack of support for the 300 passengers walking out of that plane at midnight in a snowing city hungry and without anywhere to go. After exiting the plane we were summarily dismissed by agents who could do nothing to help us rebook our plane find hotels or even to just to remove our ""checked-in"" status so that we could call the helpline to rebook our flight. Because the desk agents failed to remove my ""checked-in"" status (when I asked they told me it would be done in about an hour which did not happen) I had to call the help line 3 different times before someone there was able to reach the ticket office to fix things up and issue me a new ticket for next evening. Needless to say it was a sleepless night. As a single Canadian adult traveling by myself with all the right gadgets and adequate travel insurance I was lucky enough to sort everything out myself albeit with endless frustrations. I can only imagine how much worse it would have been for foreigner families or elderly people with hearing problems. Because of this experience I will probably take a vacation from Air Canada for a long long time.",14th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,3,0,0,1,137
1363,Air Canada customer review,Cohen Jonathan,Not Verified,"Toronto YYZ - Tel-Aviv TLV. Flew on new 787-8 aircraft in a standard economy window seat. The plane has only been in service since the early summer and it shows. It still looks (and smells) new. The climate control system pumped fresh air into the cabin the AC was very good. The windows on this plane are huge. The ambient lighting changed according to our journey's progress and provided a good general atmosphere. The entertainment system was excellent and fast responding with an extended selection of films TV shows games etc. Every seat came with a USB plug as well as AC power. Flight attendants were courteous professional and between them spoke 6 languages to cater to the various passengers. The overhead storage bins were very large. The cabin in general seemed spacious and pleasing. Before I review the seats and leg space please make note that I have small build 5'5"" (165 cm) and 132 pounds (60kg). Leg room was ok as long as you don't have carry on luggage on the floor. The seat reclined to a relative comfortable position (as far as an economy seat may be comfortable) although I didn't note a major improvement over other/older Air Canada planes including the 767-3 which was replaced by this plane on this route. The big problem with the seating in economy is the 3x3x3 configuration. The seats are narrow. I was lucky that nobody was sitting in the middle seat next to my window seat. The seat felt cramped without a person sitting next to me. It would've been almost unbearable to fly for 10 hours with someone next to me. Remember I'm smaller than the average person and couldn't imagine how an average or large person could last in an economy seat for such a long flight. Air Canada definitely dropped the ball with this seat configuration on an international flight. It might work for a short haul flight but not on a 10 hour flight. Simply outrageous design decision. Another inexplicable design decision was to mount controls on the arm rest exactly where you'd put your arm. There were several incidents witnessed during the flight where a passenger accidentally pressed the flight attendant button. The flight attendants reaction was as if it was a common occurrence. I myself accidentally pressed the seat lighting button a few times and changed the volume on my flight entertainment program. This is a very annoying design flaw especially if a stranger sitting next to you will push the buttons on your flight entertainment controls. Food was horrible possibly the worst meal I've come across specifically the main course for dinner as well as breakfast. One bite was more than enough to leave the food on the tray. The new plane has a lot going for it but is plagued by design flaws in economy that would most likely make the long journey in economy a very bad experience for almost every single person. Disappointing! I cannot recommend a flight on this plane in economy. My suggestion would be to pay the extra money to fly in Premium Economy. The seats looked far more comfortable and had had a better 2x3x2 configuration. I also suggest to eat prior to flying at the airport and/or buy food to eat prior to boarding.",14th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,4,1,5,0,0,2,137
1364,Air Canada customer review,T Law,Not Verified,Travelled from Heathrow to Vancouver we sat for 90 mins on the runway with little info but just problems with one of the engines. The TV did not work and we had to wait for the stewardess to be ready to re boot it! The seats are 3x4x3 and very little leg room although the leather seats were quite comfortable. The worst thing was the rude service we got from the air hostesses they looked like it was too much trouble to do anything for you! The food on return flight was appalling before we landed we were handed a yoghurt and a dry slab of some kind of cake. For the price of the flights I felt the great films did not make up for the bad service poor food and cramped conditions!,9th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,4,0,0,3,137

We first had one stop in Montreal then straight to Edmonton landing at 10.30 pm. After the 4th change Air Canada had added another layover in Toronto after Montreal now returning at 1.30 am.

1366,Air Canada customer review,Rebecca Dorman,Not Verified,Our family flew from Vancouver to Sydney in Business Class on the final leg of an around the world trip. All other Star Alliance airlines were great. Air Canada was shocking! There were no shower facilities in the Air Canada lounge in Vancouver. The aircraft was very dirty. Crumbs of food smeared sticky stuff old rubbish around our seats. We had ordered special meals due to medical conditions for 3 family members. The food was inedible - overcooked. Our business class meal consisted of chicken that was too hard to cut potatoes that disintegrated as soon as we tried to pick it up with a fork. Dessert was a small fruit salad. We were offered our breakfast instead of our dinner in case that was better and the crew were understanding but there were no other food options available for a 19 hour flight. We were hungry for 19 hours (travelling with 2 children). This would have been unacceptable in economy. Upon receiving our complaint Air Canada offered 10% discount off our next flight.

That was no great hassle I had a good book. Boarding was well done. Terminal 2 at Heathrow was hopeless. It took an hour to get through Immigration. Many booths were empty and the fast track computers were ""down"" so the fast trackers cluttered up the ""other passports"" group. Air Canada has some terrible reviews and my son in Calgary warned me of its reputation so I had bought some muesli bars just in case. I was pleasantly surprised the flight was good.

1370,Air Canada customer review,John Brough,Not Verified,26th September 1.5 hours late leaving London Heathrow for Montreal. Knew I would miss my connecting flight to Toronto City where I had family waiting for me. Was assured from the aircrew that Air Canada ground crew were aware of the delay and arrangements had been made to fly Toronto passengers out on two flights. All we had to do was contact the AC agents at Montreal. Suffice to say no one was available to help in fact a less helpful bunch of individuals I have yet to meet. After lots of chasing around from one departure gate to another I was eventually put on a flight to Toronto Pearson which resulted in my sister having to dash across Toronto at the last minute. Furthermore it seems my luggage arrived on an earlier flight isn't that a security breach? All in all a very poor service from Air Canada which has resulted in me vowing never to fly with them again going back to Air Transat.,6th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,3,0,0,3,138

I was greeted by the most caring and compassionate ticket agent who immediately called the medics. They got a wheelchair and ice packs for my face and accompanied me through customs after clearing me for travel with the on call doctor. They gave me extra ice packs for the flight to Toronto and the flight attendants gave me a bag of ice to rest my face in and constantly checked back to check my comfort.

On boarding the plane we were not greeted merely nodded at by a 'gentleman' who barely glanced at our boarding passes and said 'down there'! Not a great start and this attitude and lack of care or service continued throughout the flight. Not one of the cabin crew smiled during the whole flight - for which I was awake the whole time!

1375,Air Canada customer review,Dela Santa Corazon,Not Verified,Our Air Canada flight to Barcelona August 8 and our return from Madrid August 21 were saddled with cancellations delays and very poor customer service. As the 8.50 flight was getting closer to departure time on the night of August 8 passengers were first told that the aircraft had not arrived while the crew had come in. Then we were told that there was no part and it was best to wait and be safe than sorry. By 10.30 additional staff came in and said that the part had arrived. After an hour of waiting close to midnight we learned there was no crew to fly and the flight was cancelled. The station manager came in with security and more staff. The manager said that all hotels in downtown Montreal were full booked thus no hotel for us. He however guaranteed that we would be flying the next day to Barcelona and that we could retrieve our luggage and AC staff will make sure that we are comfortable. There was not a single staff member around after customs so passengers who decided to sleep in the airport went around looking for benches and chairs to sleep on. Vouchers of course were handed over but in the beginning my sister and I were told of the following: no food will be served on the flight but would be available for purchase no re-routing to catch our tour and AC was not responsible if we missed our tour. All these actions on the part of Air Canada were well orchestrated and any questions from passengers was met with Security ready to handle any raising of voices. Our Air Canada saga however did not end in Barcelona. On the way back August 21 from Madrid again the 1.30 pm flight was moved to 3.00 pm. It was not difficult to figure out again the cause for delay. As more fresh looking passengers came in to join the 3 pm flight it was clear the delay was done to combine the 1 pm and 3 pm passengers. The delay caused us to miss the connecting flight in Toronto for Montreal our final destination. When we asked Air Canada customer service if we could take an earlier flight to Montreal we were told that our luggage had been checked in for the 10.30 flight to Montreal. We could not say anything to customer service only to find out that our luggage did not arrive in Montreal in spite of the nearly 3 hour window to load our luggage. As someone enticed to fly Air Canada's direct flight to Barcelona from Montreal this airline gave its passengers a sing song routine when all passengers like me wanted to know what is really happening with our flights. Air Canada should never forget that we paid the fare they asked for be it from a travel agent or online.,1st September 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,2,0,0,1,138
1376,Air Canada customer review,Julian Wyer,Not Verified,London Heathrow to Montreal 28 August 2014 Boeing 777-333ER C-FNNW. One of Air Canada's latest Triple Sevens equipped with their latest interior in economy with black leather seats and a very cramped 3-4-3 configuration. Very narrow seats uncomfortable but just OK for a 6.5 hour flight. The controller for the in-flight entertainment screen is now placed in the arm rest just where you lean your elbows causing lights and cabin call alerts all over the cabin. Little thought has been placed into the design of Air Canada's new economy cabin! Also my light control was turning on the incorrect light (obviously little testing of their systems on a new aircraft). Cabin attendants all old-timers and all very miserable but this is consistent with my experience of AC's transatlantic offering. Food - perhaps it is time they quit the hot food service! Still cannot believe this economy cabin design has actually entered service and other airlines that also employ the 3-4-3 configuration on the Triple are far more comfortable.,1st September 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,2,3,4,0,0,5,138

A highlight on the GP-Calgary (5.00 flt) - a very friendly and funny FA. Two young chaps were using inappropriate language as they boarded and she (young FA with charm and humor and lovely French accent) reminded them of ""language"" around others.

1378,Air Canada customer review,D Yu,Not Verified,HKG-YVR. Each time I take Air Canada between Vancouver and some Asian destination I become increasingly frustrated with half of the staff's attitudes. It seems to me that some of these flight attendants tend to get easily frustrated towards Asian passengers. One flight attendant was lecturing me what I should and should not place in the overhead compartment (I really wish I just ignored her). Another major issue I have with the new seat design is the placement of the earphone plug which is located in front of us. It's extremely inconvenient to unplug it in and out all the time when a passenger next to you has to get up. Plus this is also one of the least comfortable economy seats I have sat on.,1st September 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,3,4,0,0,3,138
1379,Air Canada customer review,Ralph Smith,Not Verified,My original rant today starts because of Air Canada's online flight tracker. Every time one of our friends comes in from out of town we normally follow their progress online to make sure we don't have much of a wait at the airport. Air Canada doesn't seem to care and leave their customer's rides hanging today it was almost an hour. Now my second rant is from personal experience a number of years back and I tell anyone who asks me which airline they should use and shouldn't. I haven't taken a flight myself with Air Canada since we booked a trip using airmiles and never will again. Our flight to Cancun was originally set for 32 hours 5 stop overs and leaving from an airport an hour and a half away. A few days later I received a call from them to change my itinerary to 26 hours when I asked if they could let me use the airport 10 minutes from my home he said since we put you through the trouble OK. Sleeping in my wheelchair inside of the Mexico City and Guadalajara airport we arrived in Cancun utterly exhausted and me with a diabetic low blood sugar. On the 6 hour flight home with an overnight in Calgary my wife left me ahead to grab our luggage. When they came to get me I told them my supplies were all in the overhead compartment. The rude stewardess wouldn't even look and told me that my wife had everything. I get off of the plane and when I saw my wife she didn't have my jacket medical supplies or test kit. After spending the night trying to retrieve my medical supplies in the city we went home exhausted again. They had the nerve the next day to tell me to come and get my supplies. After them making 3 trips I finally got everything back. Even if I was offered a few flight I will never board another Air Canada plane ever again.,28th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,3,0,0,1,138
1380,Air Canada customer review,Jeff Russell,Not Verified,YYC to Narita return: Horrible flight there. Checked in for my wife and I with seats together the night before. Somehow when we showed up at the airport the seats were separated. Managed to change 1 seat with a nice Japanese lady. Both inflight entertainment systems did not work. About 50% of the cabin had the same issues. How hard is it to test the system beforehand? Or upgrade to a system that works. On the way to Narita we were both stuck with the Japanese meal being at the back of the plane. Was awful. On the return flight back we managed to get seats in the front of the plane and had a much better meal. Still 1 out of 2 inflight systems did not work properly only a couple of movies worked. We were both a sleep/dosing when they served the breakfast ~2hrs from Calgary and were both woken up did it look like we wanted breakfast?,28th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,139
1381,Air Canada customer review,A Liberman,Not Verified,I flew Air Canada from BOS-YYZ on 8/20/14 in economy class. FA's were friendly and the seats were very comfortable. Not that many movie choices but it is a short flight. On the way back there was a problem with my name during boarding (probably because I was an unaccompanied minor) and as an apology I got a free business class upgrade. The food was great and the seats were very nice. I recommend it.,28th August 2014,,Business Class,,,4,4,5,3,0,0,4,139
1382,Air Canada customer review,K Fisher,Not Verified,Flight AC 7439 was cancelled in LaGuardia no explanation. Put on another flight to YYZ and connection to Edmonton. Counter clerk printed out wrong boarding pass so had to return from security to get correct pass. Flight was late and arrived in YYZ with 30 minutes to clear customs grab bags drop off bags at domestic go through security and get to gate. No Air Canada representative anywhere in this process to assist in getting through quickly so we missed our flight. The counter clerk insinuated we should have asked for help. I asked the Baggage Clerk the Information Clerk the Customs Clerk and the Security Clerk. There was no Air Canada representative present anywhere during this process. I realize there may be a reasonable explanation for cancellations but we were given none. Worst part is that their Executives could care less so it goes from the top down as to the contempt they have for passengers. Air Canada will never see me or my family on one of their flights again.,28th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,139
1383,Air Canada customer review,S Walford,Not Verified,YYZ-YEG Full flight. Overall a great experience from web check in to early departure and early arrival. Great service by friendly cabin crew.

1384,Air Canada customer review,John Smith,Not Verified,YVR-LHR on the high density 777. Will avoid this aircraft in the future. Seats were filthy when we got on the plane with garbage shoved under the seat and in the pockets. Not acceptable for business class. Service was poor and staff constantly running around frantically. No water runs no one came to collect garbage and there was no snack bar unlike other 777 flights. Food was mediocre at best. One positive about the 777HD is that the IFE is excellent and the TV screen is much larger. If you are seated next to someone consider yourself stuck because it is very difficult to climb over when the seat is reclined.,26th August 2014,,Business Class,,,3,2,2,4,0,0,3,139
1385,Air Canada customer review,J Taylor,Not Verified,I have just recently completed 2 return trips YYC-YYZ in Y class after a number of AC rouge flights and have to say I felt like I'd been upgraded. Flights were comfortable entertainment had a great selection right at my seat and I didn't have to download an App to watch 30 yr old movies. Inflight service was good lots of overhead cabin room and the best part - adequate leg room! I am still a fan of AC but really hope they do away with AC rouge asap. It's bringing the AC brand image down to a very low level.,26th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,5,5,3,5,0,0,4,139
1386,Air Canada customer review,R Lowry,Not Verified,Air Canada Express (Jazz) YYZ - Charlottetown PEI - YYZ August 12-19. Given the strong and well deserved criticism levelled at Air Canada's bizarre Rouge offering I want to compliment those in charge and working in their Express service. Our flights to Charlottetown and back were on time professionally operated with a calm atmosphere completely absent the tension that exists on so many stressful jammed-in flights. The CRJ 705 to PEI was very comfortable you could cross an ocean in those seats no problem. The smaller CRJ 200 on the way back is more snug with a couple of inches less leg room but still adequate for the flight length. The CRJ 200 lacks the entertainment system and catering of the 705 that is the only thing removing some stars from my overall rating. Now that I will not book an Air Canada flight that could be Rouged at a later date it is good to know that there are some services under the Air Canada brand that one can take with a confident expectation of good service and a pleasant flight. Well done Jazz Aviation and AC Express.,26th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,3,0,0,4,139
1387,Air Canada customer review,J Keep,Not Verified,We flew LHR-Toronto outbound via Halifax and return via Montreal. Overall experience was positive with genuinely helpful and kind cabin crew on all legs decent IFE selection and all flights arriving on time even after one was delayed so they could find a bigger plane to accommodate a previous cancellation! All the connections were well managed too by calm and well organised staff. The LHR-Halifax flight is clearly not a prestige route and the older 767 along with some rather informal cabin crew and one bordering on 'doddery' did give the feel of something closer to a motorway diner than an international airline but we enjoyed it anyway. Where Air Canada does have big room for improvement is the food. Meals were given on both transatlantic flights but all were decidedly average with breakfast before landing at LHR a single piece of cake! Many have complained about the 3-4-3 seating layout on the new 777-300ERs and yes it is busy boarding and there are sometimes queues for the toilets but I'm 6'2 and even with my long legs it was manageable for 6 hours if not luxurious. Overall we were pleasantly surprised.,26th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,5,2,4,0,0,4,139
1388,Air Canada customer review,Hayley Peterson,Not Verified,AC8886 I flew from Edmonton to Newfoundland. My flight from Edmonton was delayed 55 minutes the lady at the ticket desk did not even check in my son so that caused a hassle when I went to get on the plane. When I got to Halifax the plane was delayed 3.5 hours. I had 2 cranky boys under 3 years old everything was closed at the airport they gave me a $10 meal voucher and were very rude about it. I do not recommend this airline.,26th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,5,3,3,0,0,2,139
1389,Air Canada customer review,Richard Lau,Not Verified,I will definitely not fly with Air Canada again. Had a previous bad experience with them and thought maybe give them another chance. Wife and I flew out of Paris from CDG. Boarded aircraft along with other 398 passengers and waited for over an hour for the plane to depart. No apologies nor explanations other than a brief P.A. about waiting for one late baggage. Plane arrived at Montreal one hour late and all passengers were not allowed to disembark due to some medical problem with one single person with another further delay of 20 minutes or so. We rushed to baggage claim to retrieve the check-ins then to an Air Canada connections kiosk. The clerk was extremely slow and seemed unsure how to process the transfer and became irritated when told that we were in a hurry to catch the 4 pm connector in 45 mins. She eventually told us that she would be placing us on a 8 pm connector instead. She became even more irate when asked for an explanation and merely told us to move on and just place the luggage on the conveyor. Another agent then came over and demanded us not to place the luggage on the conveyor as the flight was not until 8 pm and we were required to lug them around until further notice. While waiting for the connector - we spoke with a supervisor at an Air Can ticket counter and she explained that all passengers must be checked in 1 hour to departure hence we were placed on an 8 pm connector. At no time did any Air Canada staff members offer any apologies or help to alleviate the problem.,26th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,3,0,0,1,139

1391,Air Canada customer review,J Taylor,Not Verified,LHR to Calgary: Check in at brand new T2 was a complete shambles - not sure if this is AC's problem or T2 teething troubles? Not enough staff around to deal with self check-in problems and only 2 check in desks available - the queue was long and slow! On board in Economy seat pitch and leg room was pretty good for 2 adults and 1 child. Everything else distinctly average. Return leg Vancouver to LHR Premium Economy: Self check in worked fine but bag drop slow and everyone in the same queue with not one AC rep on the airport floor in sight. Seats in Premium OK. Flight delayed for around an hour due to them being unable to get the door closed. Inflight service really poor - food was absolutely dire and meal of choice had run out even before we'd left the ground. Flight attendants completely lacking in attentiveness - no rubbish collection despite me having a nice tidy little bag full of bits which I deliberately left in sight. Even as we came in to land it got missed on their final cabin check. Missed drinks/coffee runs - there was definitely a preferred customer system in operation - fine we may not be frequent flyer members (and never will be!) but we've still paid a premium fare and shouldn't be completely overlooked. Baggage reclaim at LHR T2 a mess - again not sure if this is AC's problem but surely LHR should know what they're doing by now? All in all both Air Canada and LHR's shiny new T2 have disappointed. Not sure we'll be able to avoid using T2 again in the future but certainly we will not be choosing AC again.,18th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,2,0,0,2,140
1392,Air Canada customer review,J Eric,Not Verified,Our NRT-YVR flight was quite pleasant. The flight attendants spoke English and Japanese and were friendly and accommodating. They helped with the overhead luggage (something rarely seen with US carriers) and worked hard to help with entertainment and tried to provide service during heavy turbulence. There were at least two choices of dinner both quite nice. Kids got their meals first. Slippers would have been nice (like one gets on Asian airlines). The movie selection was good. Overall an on-time well-handled flight.,18th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,5,0,0,5,140
1393,Air Canada customer review,Radda Stephan,Not Verified,"We bought a ticket for Vienna - Toronto - Orlando and back Miami -–Toronto - Vienna online and got tickets for flights AC6167 AC1866 AC917 AC 6166. The first problem was we could not reserve seats for the Vienna-Toronto flight because it was operated by Austrian Airlines. We checked in online at the first opportunity and had an uneventful trip to Miami the Air Canada Plane being a little rugged was an ""Air Rouge"" flight but it was ok. The return flight was a disaster. The Plane from Miami arrived late from Toronto which resulted in missing the Vienna flight. We asked the onboard personnel if they could give us any information on the status of our connecting flight but the same problem again: they told us they had no info on the Austrian Airlines flight and that it was ""out of their hands"" - then they got annoyed when we asked for priority disembarking. Well we ran for it but it had not waited for our party of 8. We were split up re-routed to Paris AC880 and then after 5 hours of waiting to Vienna by Air France flight AF1738. We had to get the Air France boarding passes ourselves offered no assistance like food vouchers or lounge access but told us we could fill out a complaint form online. We had to run around so much (with 2 little children) that we used 3 hours up anyway. When we arrived finally in Vienna the luggage was missing again some confusion which Airline was responsible now. The onboard and ground personnel were indifferent at best. I will avoid air Canada at all costs in the future.",18th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,3,0,0,1,140
1394,Air Canada customer review,Martin Pelletier,Not Verified,"Flight from Ottawa to Fredericton. I arrived 42 minutes before boarding and ""missed my flight"". I Was charged 170 dollars to book a flight later. Customer ""service"" staff made no attempt to get me on my flight. They were rude and had zero empathy. On the return flight I was offered an earlier flight out of Fredericton but had a 6hr layover in Montreal. Weather in Montreal had delayed several flights. Air Canada staff directed me to wrong help booth on the first floor where I waited 45 minutes before being told rudely that they were too busy with people who had missed their flights to help me and I should try the Jazz booth on the other level. The Jazz booth had a two hour wait because of the recent weather with only one staff at the desk. When I arrived at the wait line I asked a passing staff if this was the right booth for Jazz and she told me to ""just wait in line"" whiteout even answering this simple question. I waited two hours and was told that they could not give me an earlier flight. Flights were on time but customer service was absolutely unacceptable.

1395,Air Canada customer review,James Gadd,Not Verified,LHR-YYZ return. I was on a 3-3-3 configured 777 which was quite comfortable however I would avoid the newly configured 3-4-3 777 as I understand the seat width and pitch is less - I have had experience of this configuration before and it is not comfortable. Food going out was great but terrible coming back - I guess LHR has better catering!

1396,Air Canada customer review,Beverly MacPherson,Not Verified,We acquired our tickets on May 2 2014 for travel on July 26th 2014 the flight to Charlottetown PEI was okay apart from being delayed leaving Edmonton International due to overbooking again. We received $50 per person off with 1 free meal each. Travel agent paid Air Canada for our meals however we never received them. I was told vouchers would be provided via Air Canada when our tickets were scanned but that never happened. On the return flight Aug 9 2014 from Montreal to Edmonton one of our assigned seats 33F had no television working so our son did not even have a TV screen to watch on the 4.5 hour flight back to Edmonton.

1397,Air Canada customer review,S Bradley,Not Verified,I will not fly on Air Canada if I can help it. My wife and I won tickets to fly anywhere in Canada in a contest (not through AC). We decided on St. John's NFLD. Somehow the ticket agents and boarding staff knew that we didn't pay for our tickets and from that point on the service ended. The man at the boarding desk actually said to me that I had no right to request better seats (the plane was only half full) because we didn't pay for our tickets. I was appalled at the rudeness we experience and will not fly on an airline that pays employees to treat people like this. We usually go to the border cities to fly out of to save money. But to fly domestically I will use WestJet if possible. Have flown on them twice and the service was excellent.,8th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,5,1,3,4,0,0,3,140
1398,Air Canada customer review,Jonathan Nesbitt,Not Verified,"August 2nd 2014 AC009. We arrived at a very crowded very unruly check in counter in Calgary where it was clear staff had no control of the lineup. When you're travelling with a 5 month old this situation can create a lot of stress. Once we boarded the situation became worse. The seats were dirty and clearly very worn. It was evident that the planes climate control was broken. We sat onboard the aircraft at the gate for what seemed to be a very long time with aircraft engineers trying to fix the problem. The pilot claimed the problem was fixed we began our taxi away from the gate and then the plane just sat there. We went back to the gate and tried to get it fixed. After a lengthy wait (again) we taxied and took off. Of course once airborne the cooling system still did not work and the pilot informed us that we were going to be diverted to Vancouver to potentially switch planes. Told a new plane was being readied and we would be boarding 7pm Vancouver time. When we went to our new check in gate the situation went from worse to downright awful. Ground staff had no idea on seat assignments and couldn't figure out where to seat everyone. We thankfully got our bassinet seats but other passengers were told to board and to find a seat ""anywhere they could"". We finally got in the air 9 hours after our ordeal. I will never fly Air Canada again.",5th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,3,0,0,1,140
1399,Air Canada customer review,A Hall,Not Verified,I travelled premium economy on Air Canada from Vancouver to Heathrow. This product is very good value in my opinion. Seats were similar to AC domestic standard business class about 38' or more pitch two on the sides. The dinner meal was a condensed business class meal in my opinion having travelled in that class previously. The wine drinks service was excellent staff were very attentive. Morning meal more standard fare but fine. Air Canada has come a long way in service over the past few years and I would definitely choose them over any American carrier and many European ones. I thought the dinner meal was better than what I ate on united first class. UA could take lessons from AC.,5th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,0,0,5,140
1400,Air Canada customer review,Hannah Lingrell,Not Verified,"San Francisco - Toronto - Madrid: Poorest plane I have flown in and that's saying a lot as I've flown a lot during my time as a flight attendant and on my own for pleasure trips. Seats in the plane from Toronto to Madrid were very narrow and cramped (and I'm a petite slim female) and extremely uncomfortable (did they purchase the seat foam at the dollar store? I think Greyhound bus seats would have definitely been more comfortable). I had recently called in to customer service to request a bland meal after getting horrible food poisoning days before my flight but unfortunately there was no special meal for me at dinner time. So lucky me I got to eat a bread roll for dinner. No free food was served on the flight from San Francisco to Toronto? It was considered a ""national"" flight. What? It was an 8-hour flight that crossed an international border. Entertainment was one screen in front for the whole economy cabin on an international flight (Toronto to Madrid).

We explained that we had already paid this in San Diego and that it would have been for the entire flight to Vancouver not just part way. The AC ""customer care"" representative was surly and annoyed at our refusal to pay this charge twice.

We had a terrible experience flying Air Canada business class. First of all on all segments' seating was separated for my wife and myself and every time we tried to change seating so we could sit together AC staff didn't seem to care and gave us false info on the aircraft seating arrangement. We had to stop over at Calgary and the flight attendant was not familiar with the US citizen passing through and did not give us a Canadian custom form (luggage must be picked up and sent through US custom at the airport). The Air Canada ground staff were also was not clear about US bound passenger's procedure.

1406,Air Canada customer review,T Eldem,Not Verified,AC 811 from IST to YYZ on B767-300. The ground services in Istanbul are handled by a third party for Air Canada and are appalling. I am a top-tier AC frequent flyer and used the priority check-in which took an extraordinarily long time to process our party of 4 travellers. There were 5 agents behind the desk with only one dealing with the passengers and the rest simply watching. Boarding process was utterly chaotic with 9 agents in attendance and none of them at all interested in answering the queries from the passengers or helping them. I had to inquire 3 times about priority boarding before I was offered a snippy response. In one of those instances the agent made eye-contact and then simply walked away from me completely ignoring my question. The gate assigned for the flight was woefully inadequate to handle a Transatlantic flight. 200+ passengers were processed through a check-in facility more suited for commuter planes. We were eventually bussed to the aircraft adding further delays to a flight that was already delayed by 90 minutes. Once onboard the aircraft showed its age with tired interior worn-out PODS inoperable washrooms and dull lighting. FA's were very attentive and the AVOD selection offered plenty of options. Two meals and frequent water-runs were offered throughout the 11-hour long flight. The meals were mediocre at best but drink selection was good. The only redeeming aspect of the journey was the amazing Business Lounge operated by Turkish Airlines. The flight arrived late but we were lucky to make our connection. Air Canada must take a serious look at their ground service arrangement in Istanbul as it really gets the passengers off to an unpleasant experience.,31st July 2014,,Business Class,,,3,5,2,4,0,0,2,141

1408,Air Canada customer review,J Mainville,Not Verified,Ottawa to Antigua via Toronto (July 20th). The flight between Ottawa-Toronto was lengthened by more than 20 minutes and left us with 35 minutes to catch our connecting flight to Antigua. Not an easy task when you have to run up floors than down while changing to other sections of the terminal. The return flight on July 27th was even worse. Toronto-Ottawa was cancelled due to severe weather. It took us two hours to access customer service on the premises. Not enough agents contradictory advise. We were put on stand-by on the 00.30hr flight with crossed- fingers wishing us luck. I can't understand that with the technology we have today they don't known the number of people who book the flight.

1411,Air Canada customer review,Nicola Origgi,Not Verified,Mexico City-Toronto-Milan Malpensa round trip in business class. Air Canada delivers a consistent and sound business class product with some features that make it more similar to a first class product. For example the seat configuration on the 767 (1-1-1) is really comfortable and give a great degree of privacy that is not provided on other 4* airlines. Staff service very attentive. I had a 12 hours layover in Toronto and Air Canada provided me a room free of charge at the Gateway Sheraton: a detail that was very much appreciated. I suggest an improvement on drinks in Business Class: for instance an upgrade in whisky and a wider selection would be both very much appropriated.,29th July 2014,,Business Class,,,5,5,3,5,0,0,4,142
1412,Air Canada customer review,M Smith,Not Verified,I flew from Toronto to Sydney Australia via Vancouver. The flight was very comfortable. Sure the seat could have been roomier but there was adequate leg room. The leg from Toronto to Vancouver was great no one in the middle seat! And because I was continuing on to Sydney I got free food (a choice of a meal item and a snack). The food on the long haul leg was okay nothing special but edible for myself. Free bar service is nice! Service was good and water was plentiful. I think Air Canada's seat back TV is best in class. Lots to choose from when you can't sleep! The only think I wish Air Canada did differently is get rid of 3x3x3 seating and make it 2x4x2. Yes less seats overall but it would make it a more pleasant flying experience for all!,22nd July 2014,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,142

I paid extra for choice of preferred seats and while there was sufficient legroom the seats were so narrow as to make comfort and ultimately sleep impossible. The food was really nothing more than garbage with a choice of ""gruel"" or a slice of some sort of egg for breakfast. For dinner I chose the beef which was a very poor quality meat all fat and only 3 little pieces. I think next time I will pay more and try to fly with another carrier.",17th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,4,0,0,3,142
1414,Air Canada customer review,Michael Sackey,Not Verified,We flew from Toronto to Hong Kong direct. The seats were fine and the flight attendants were friendly but the food was really atrocious. The sum of the meals were carbohydrate heavy. For snacks we were offered pretzels and later some kind of shortbread-like cookie. The snack on the return trip included a roast beef sandwich which had nothing but white bread and roast beef (no lettuce no dressing nothing!). Oh yes one of the other snacks was cup o'noodles. For main meal one of the dishes was some kind of white pasta pellets with a little bit of chicken. Another main meal was white congee (i.e. white rice porridge) or egg. So again carbs carbs carbs! I'm not anti- carb but the meals were all heavily laden with carbs with very little else to go with it. Not even vegetables!,17th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,4,1,4,0,0,4,142
1415,Air Canada customer review,Thiessen Gerald,Not Verified,Winnipeg to Nashville via Toronto. Was scheduled to fly Sunday morning. Plane was delayed due to mechanical problems things like this happen. The problem was we were not informed that our flight was delayed while standing in the line. The board showed our flight to be on time. Needless to say we stood for over 2 hours in line and were late to board our plane. Then told our plane was delayed. No help was offered while we were in the line only told we would have to wait our turn. Ended up flying into Toronto later that day but missed our connecting flight to Nashville. Thankfully Air Canada paid for our hotel and part of our supper in Toronto. On our return we were on schedule coming into Toronto according to our tickets. But when we had gone through customs and were ready recheck our bags to get the connecting flight to Winnipeg we were told we were too late as the baggage had to be checked in 1 hour in advance of the next flight. No effort to get us on the original flight. Thankfully I had enough time after landing in Winnipeg that I could still drive home. The service we got at the airports was just appalling. Flight attendants were okay. Luckily I was flying for holidays and not for work where time missed could be very costly.,17th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,4,0,0,2,142
1416,Air Canada customer review,K Gelderen,Not Verified,We flew from Frankfurt to Calgary and 3 weeks later again from Vancouver to London. Our first trip was a bit hectic because we had very little time to catch our connecting flight. We had to run to our gate and once arrived there was a big queue. We were assigned 2 seats apart from each other (15 rows in between) so despite the big queue we went to the Air Canada desk at the gate to ask if it was possible to change our seats. The lady was friendly and she did manage to change our seats on this very short notice so that was positive. During the flight the food was good you could choose from different soft drinks (cans not just a glass) and the flight attendants came by with water quite often. The inflight entertainment was good as well (touchscreen). On the returning flight we had a newer airplane but the experience was not as good. The seat configuration was different as they added an extra row of seats which made 3-4-3. Because of this the seats were very small and less comfortable. Also the food was quite bad and the flight attendants were not as friendly and less skilled. The inflight entertainment system however was even better (latest version) so no complaints about that at all. Overall impression of flying with Air Canada was good. Would we choose for Air Canada again? Probably yes.,15th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,5,0,0,4,142
1417,Air Canada customer review,P Smith,Not Verified,YYZ-LHR-YYZ. Outbound flight on new 787. Return on 777-300. The new planes are a very welcome addition and a solid improvement over the dated 767. AC has reconfigured the business class pods for the 787 so they point towards the window instead of away. TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment. AC's switch from T3 to T2 is a good move as the terminal is much nicer and easier to get through security although the walk to the Heathrow Express is a long one.,11th July 2014,,Business Class,,,5,4,2,3,0,0,3,142
1418,Air Canada customer review,Michelle St-Germain,Not Verified,"I had booked a trip from Ottawa to San Diego with United Airlines. The flight I had to Chicago from Ottawa got cancelled due to weather conditions and I accepted an alternate route through Air Canada which I regret doing. The airplane sat on the YOW tarmac for over an hour and the flight attendants could only say that it was because there was lightening storms in Toronto. Only good thing I can say is that they turned off the engine and allowed us to get out of our seats while we waited. On my way off the plane in TOR no one was able to provide assistance on how to ensure I could make my connecting flight to San Diego which was showing ""on time"" on the flight board. After passing customs baggage check etc. the flight was no longer showing on the flight board. The AC flight attendants I found roaming around had no clue where to direct me. I happen to find the service desk and was told to get in line even though I said my flight was leaving in 10 minutes and I simply needed the gate number. As there were 4 people in line my flight had left by the time I received ""service"". So booking another flight to get to San Diego I opted for a layover in Los Angeles that night instead of waiting another 24 hours in Toronto. I was not offered any compensation for either spending the night in Toronto nor Los Angeles even though Air Canada caused me to miss my flight. Staff member told me he could not give me the boarding pass for the next days flight but omitted to say he did not complete the booking and that I was expected to go to the AC ticket counter at LAX to get one. I only got the customer service contact information when I returned to the desk to confirm my flight to San Diego was in fact the next morning at 9.55. After a short night in a close by hotel I returned to the LAX airport the next morning. I went to US airlines who had no trace of my info who redirected me to American Airlines I found out that there was no ticket for me as the booking the TO agent did not complete the booking. The agent in Toronto said he could do nothing for me because the notes on file said I had accepted LAX as my final destination. Told I needed to speak with a ticket agent at LAX to see what they could do for me. I walked from American Eagle terminal 4 to Air Canada terminal 2 and back. I barely made the 11.30 flight. I hate to think what would have happened to my baggage had I any with me on this trip. I received no apologies from anyone at Air Canada throughout this whole ordeal.",11th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,142
1419,Air Canada customer review,T Eldem,Not Verified,LHR to YUL on Boeing 777. Following a somewhat chaotic boarding process driven by the awkward queuing arrangement at the new Terminal #2 boarded the plane only to sit on board for nearly 50 minutes awaiting ATC clearance for takeoff. Once in the air the service was prompt with very attentive FA's. Meal and drink selections were good but the main course I chose lacked flavour. Good inflight AVOD with decent selection of movies and entertainment. Pre-arrival snack was mediocre at best. Despite a late departure the crew was able to make up most of the lost time achieving an almost on schedule arrival. Overall it was a pleasant experience but I must say the new staggered seat configuration in business class is a significant downgrade from the pods. Seat controls are in the arm rest resulting in frequent accidental activation. In lie-flat position one's feet have to fit into a very small space which is very uncomfortable. Swiss utilizes the same seats but provides more leg/foot room. The table is difficult to operate and even the FA's struggle with it. I have been a top-tier loyal customer of AC but if they choose to convert all of their long-haul business class to this seating configuration I will look for alternatives in a hurry.,8th July 2014,,Business Class,,,1,4,3,3,0,0,3,142
1420,Air Canada customer review,D Collard,Not Verified,Vancouver to Victoria on 16 June 2014 a 20-minute flight aboard a Dash8-300 connecting from Lufthansa. As I was leaving the Vancouver immigration and customs hall personnel of the Canadian Border Services Agency directed me to the wrong exit. Hence instead of going through a dedicated security line for passengers connecting to domestic flights I found myself in the main airport arrivals area bringing all my checked baggage with me even though it was tagged to Victoria my final destination. I asked an AC staff member driving an electric cart whether there was somewhere to drop my checked baggage or whether I should head for the domestic check-in queues. The airport wasn't busy she confirmed that my baggage was already tagged to my final destination and she had no passengers in her cart; so she took me directly to a separate counter (with its own conveyor belt) used for wheelchair passengers accepted my already-checked bag and issued my boarding card. Excellent treatment by Air Canada staff. (As it was a 20-minute flight it had no food or entertainment.),6th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,0,0,4,143
1421,Air Canada customer review,D Joseph,Not Verified,I've been a status flyer with AC for decades and look forward to the day when other airlines are allowed to compete in Canada for AC routes. Recent changes to Air Canada's 'reward' system mean it is much more difficult and expensive to achieve and retain status. I often fly YYC-NRT on AC010. Formerly Tango Plus fares were full status points at a reasonable price and upgradable. This has now changed the 'low cost' Tango fare usually gives you a ticket at a higher price with only 25% of the status points of the former fare and is not upgradable. Customers seeking an upgradable fare must instead book Flex which is a substantially higher price (35-45% higher). Additionally Air Canada will now bill you an extra $750 per leg to book the upgrade. My experience on June 8th was this. Pay extra for a Flex fare in order to upgrade. Upgrade not available so I've paid extra $350 for the Flex fare to sit in a lower priced economy seat available at a cheaper price. An out and out rip-off. If I had received the upgrade the extra costs for this leg would be $350 for the Flex fare class plus $750 for the upgrade itself = $1100. Add to this a flight crew that were disengaged and robotic.,6th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,2,0,0,1,143

1423,Air Canada customer review,David Tebbutt,Not Verified,"Very poor quality service for Canada's ""National"" carrier. My wife and I travelled economy class Heathrow-Toronto on 9/6/2014 Vancouver-Anchorage on 16/6/2014 (admittedly this route is now down-graded to their low-cistern carrier Air Canada Rouge) and finally Vancouver-Heathrow on 25/6/2014. No problem with aircraft but cabin crew appeared insufficiently trained in a number of aspects incl. seat and window-blind positions for landing. Quality of food was appalling especially the vegetarian option my wife had pre booked and which was served 20-30 minutes before main service -she had finished what little she could eat before mine had arrived! The crowning glory was the offer called ""breakfast"" served after 8 hours a 9-hour flight and consisted of a small rectangle of dry cake with tea or coffee.

1424,Air Canada customer review,K Lockie,Not Verified,Cabin crew were ok. Ground crew were overwhelmed and just didn't care what happened. Connections agent did not use any information system to inform us that our flight in 20 minutes had already departed. In fact our connection had been delayed 45 mins giving us adequate time to get to the gate. The connections agent directed us to stand on line for flight rebooking and for hotel accommodation. After 1 hour of waiting all the Air Canada agents went home and told us to rebook ourselves.

1425,Air Canada customer review,D Collard,Not Verified,Victoria to Vancouver 4 June 2014 a 20-minute flight aboard a new Dash8-Q400 connecting to Lufthansa. The Dash8 series has never been able to accommodate a full-sized carry-on bag in the passenger cabin either in the overhead bin or under the seat in front. As a solution AC has accepted full-sized carry-on bags aboard the Dash8-100 - 200 and -300 models by having passengers place their bags on a cart beside the airstairs when boarding placed them in the baggage compartment as the last bags by the compartment door and then put those bags on another cart at the foot of the airstairs for passengers to collect upon arrival. With its new Dash8-Q400s Air Canada cannot do this but it only announced that fact at the gate at Victoria telling passengers that their full-sized carry- ons would be taken only as checked baggage to their final destination. Passengers were forced to take out from their carry-ons all the items essential to keep with them during their entire trip (laptops prescription medications anything breakable or valuable). My own carry-on is only two-thirds the standard full size and (just barely) fits under the seat in front so I was able to keep it in my possession for my entire 16-hour journey. Travellers should avoid AC flights served by Dash8-Q400 aircraft unless they use smaller carry-on bags not the standard full-sized ones.

1426,Air Canada customer review,J Edward,Not Verified,LHR to Toronto. Although I had originally seen a suitable flight schedule with Air Canada my travel agent organised for me to fly with Lufthansa as she said they were a more reputable airline. Turned out it was code share with Air Canada meaning no access to meal choice no seat selection and subsequently general anxiety about the booking. I got to the airport 3 hours before each time. At Heathrow I was patronised at the counter with 'everyone knows that showing up early does nothing anymore'. I was given a seat in the last row of the plane that only reclined slightly. No problem I am an experienced traveller and although I was on the way to give one of the most important presentations of my life I was able to relax and keep calm. At Toronto airport checking in for the Heathrow flight I had to queue a very long time and then was told there was no assigned seat for me. I went to Lufthansa to see if there was anything they could do for me. I asked why I could not check in online. They told me because the code was a Lufthansa code not recognised by Air Canada. They then told me that because I had bought a significantly cheaper fare (I hadn't) that I should expect to be treated like this. I did however notice that my class was Y which is usually on my boarding pass when I travel economy. Finally 30 minutes before the flight they called my name and had assigned my seat in the last row of the aircraft where I could not recline. This was the overnight flight from Toronto to Heathrow and I had to go back to work the next day. I was offered a choice of two meat based meals and had to refuse them as I am vegetarian. No seat choice no meal choice. My advice is to give code share a miss. Lufthansa and Air Canada may well be partners but when you travel Air Canada as a Lufthansa customer you are bottom rung nobody who somehow deserves to be patronised by all.,1st July 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,2,0,0,2,143

1432,Air Canada customer review,Pettifer Tim,Not Verified,"Air Canada - Canada's discount airline! I fly 100+ flights on Air Canada every year and have done so for 10 yrs. It's sad to see the decline of our national carrier in recent years. Operations at most US stations are now run by outsourced contractors who poorly represent the airline and generally have no interest in providing customer service. Air Canada has relocated many of its US gates from main terminals with good services and lounge options to 2nd tier facilities serving discount or charter carriers. The mainline now operates very few flights in North America subcontracting most flights to Jazz Sky Regional and now ""Rouge"". The product has become so inconsistent that unless one flies AC very regularly it would be almost impossible to now what to expect when you book a flight. Hint - avoid Rouge like the plague! To offer Rouge as a low cost / low service alternative is fine - to discontinue mainline service and replace it with Rouge is not fine! It's good to see that the airline has become profitable however if the product continues to decline and competitors continue to expand their offering and provide a viable option to Air Canada's long held virtual monopoly the profitability will be short lived.",23rd June 2014,,Business Class,,,3,2,3,3,0,0,1,144

Flew round trip June 5-11. Everything was excellent. Always impressed by AC service. Went to bed as soon as we took off and opted for the dine on demand service instead of the regular meal service. Crew made sure everything stayed warm until I was ready to eat. The food was great for 35000ft up. Bar service always great never have to worry about not having anything to drink. Usual breakfast before landing was so so. Only recommendation would be to time the meals for the time of day. We landed at 5PM continental breakfast at 3pm isn't exactly exciting but its better than nothing. Crew were fantastic always attentive asking if they could you anything else. Seats super comfy.

Again another full flight so I couldn't change my seat in the rear. Thankfully for good weather in Toronto that day the flight actually departed early and landed more than 30 minutes earlier at NRT! Staff service was pleasant. Food was again above expectations: the chicken with couscous was great! Unfortunately the plane that day was out of potable water (only bottled water) hence no hot beverages or cup noodles could be served - disappointment. Thankfully in-flight entertainment was better than on NRT-YYZ: volume or sound system was still not reliable - conversation too soft but background music too loud. But the variety of movies was good managed to catch up on old movies that I've been wanting to watch but missed. Kudos also to a particular flight attendant (should have gotten her name she was also serving us on my NRT-YYZ leg) who provided me with Tylenol for my headache when I asked her at the end of my flight.

You are on window side but there is no window. Leg room is good but the exit door bulks out in front of you. It is by the galley and the washrooms so lots of traffic. It is also narrower than normal due to tray table and TV being in the side of the seat. You definitely feel scrunched into this seat. Food was the usual awful economy stodge all carbs no fresh veg or fruit. So called continental breakfast was a slab of cake!

It is by the galley and the washrooms so lots of traffic. Staff were indifferent rushed and not overly friendly. Food was the usual economy stodge loads of carbs not much else. I had the chicken which comprised a dried out 2 inch piece of chicken instant mashed potato and 2 tiny broccoli florets so overcooked as to be almost unrecognizable.

1442,Air Canada customer review,W Woon,Not Verified,NRT-YYZ on 77W (2-class i.e. older) AC2 on 31 May. It was a full flight I wanted to change my seat from the rear but I couldn't. Thought that AC deserved a little more credit amidst all the negative reviews on Skytrax which did scare me a little. I guess in general where delays or problems don't occur AC probably performs fine. Staff service was pleasant (occasionally a little less friendly). Food was surprisingly better than I expected: food looked and tasted decent (maybe it's catering from NRT) we were rather well-fed (2 meals + instant noodles) drink runs conducted regularly. Seat comfort was alright: standard fare comparable to other airlines cant really complain especially when their new 77W product seems so much worse. Quibbles arise from the in-flight entertainment: mine worked fine but the volume or sound system was not good - volume was at maximum but sound was still terribly muffled (I could only hear half of the conversation while watching movies making movies with heavy narration un-watchable). Other quibbles include the (at least 20 minutes) delays on departure and the very shaky ride we had due to turbulence - I suspect my seated at the rear of the plane meant more shaking. Overall I guess there has to be a reason why they're a Skytrax 4-star airline and winner of Best Airline in North America for 4 years in a row? I sure hope my return journey YYZ-NRT remains like this or better.,16th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,3,0,0,4,145

That is exactly what happened and we and some other passengers were off the plane proceeding quickly to a gate where we were supposed to board AC 876.

1444,Air Canada customer review,J Khan,Not Verified,I booked on Air Canada in January. They sent me a revised itinerary in March. They then sent another revised itinerary in Late April just before my flight. I checked the time and saw that the seats I had reserved and paid for were correct. I ended up being rebooked by Air Canada on Rouge. It was horrible. There was no legroom. You can't recline the seat more than an inch. There was an entertainment system that required you to have your own tablet but when you went to the app there were no first rum movies. My initial flight was on a different type of plane so my original seats didn't match up and my husband and I had someone sitting between us. When I complained to Air Canada I was told that they can bump people to a lower class ticket than you purchased and they hoped to see me soon on another Air Canada flight.

1445,Air Canada customer review,C Shannon,Not Verified,My partner and I have had sporadic good/bad service with Air Canada in the past and until this year I have been fairly neutral about them. However my partners continued poor service through Air Canada for his work trips since February has made me rethink my opinion on them. He has had multiple flights with AC from Toronto to Newark Intl for work and it seems over the last 4 months the service has continued to degrade. AC has continued to overbook flights. On top of overbooking every flight seems to range between late and very late. This level of tardiness could be explained away in February as bad weather but now with not even a cloud in the sky the excuse has gone to continual maintenance issues. As I type this my partner is still sitting in his now 4 hour delay with no explanation why the crew can't seem to get the plane off the ground. I understand things happen sometimes but the way problems are handled is clearly an issue this airline needs to work on. Not all of our service has been bad but all of the recent service has been rather poor. The additional seat area with more legroom is a very nice option for customers and the little TV screens offering movies and music are also very welcome and help with longer flights. However food options are questionable and as I mentioned tardiness and rude attending staff at the terminals coupled with recent check-in issues (like not being able to print boarding passes online) really sour the service.,9th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,4,0,0,1,145
1446,Air Canada customer review,Joe Stephan,Not Verified,Flew Zurich ZRH to Toronto YYZ on new 787 Dreamliner. Good air quality and I felt noticeably great after the flight. Flight arrived in Toronto 1/2 hour early. The food was nothing special for economy but what can one expect. Staff were friendlier than usual but still in their no-nonsense manner. Seats are not wide but comfortable. They have a problem with the position of the controls on the armrest just by putting your hand on the rest activates the staff call button. Was disappointed about the movie selection just a few blockbusters.,8th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,3,0,0,4,145
1447,Air Canada customer review,Simon Reusch,Not Verified,Travelled Copenhagen - Toronto on May 30 2014 and return on June 7 2014. Overall one of the best transatlantic flights I've experienced in economy class. The entertainment system is top of the class. Large clear screen and a lot of brand new movies to choose from. Of course you should bring your own favourite headset for an optimized experience. Food was excellent on the outbound flight and mediocre on the return.

1448,Air Canada customer review,L Rosenkranz,Not Verified,I flew from YVR-HKG and return on the new 777. This is my 3rd time flying this flight on these new 777s. The only reason was to use up my upgrade points for the year and then change to a new airline. This plane is terrible as is Air Canada when it comes to pretty much every aspect (comfort service etc). I am currently in Limbo about which airline to change my loyalty to but there is nothing Air Canada can do to retain me. The prices service comfort etc is absolutely terrible compared to all the other airline choices. I have been Air Canada Elite status for years but have finally come to the point of giving it up for a new airline. I hope many do the same.,5th June 2014,,Business Class,,,1,1,2,3,0,0,1,145
1449,Air Canada customer review,L Beeldman,Not Verified,SYD-YVR and YYZ-SYD in May. The only reason these very long flights were bearable was the extra we paid for Exit row seats. I had read reviews about Exit row seats being reassigned but thankfully our seats were in order except they hardly reclined at all. AC probably charges the highest rate for Preferred seats than any other airline I have flown. The flight staff were mostly friendly another stroke of luck I believe. The IFE was not that good even though we had our own headphones the sound was very bad. The food served on both flights was the worst I have eaten on a flight in a very long time. Unappetising fridge cold bread rolls/wraps quite inedible. We had gone prepared fortunately took some snacks with us otherwise a 15 hour flight without eating could well have been the result. Ground staff in SYD were fine VR and YYZ not great. We had issues with carrying Duty free in our hand luggage on the YVR/YYZ sector because staff had not been advised of the change in rules. We were made to open our suitcases to try and fit the liquor in before the staff concerned realised she had made an error. I can say with all honesty I would not fly AC again. Fortunately in this part of the world we have some great carriers.,5th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,3,1,1,0,0,2,145
1450,Air Canada customer review,A Purr,Not Verified,I was a little concerned about flying with Air Canada after reading some of the negative reviews on here but I should never have been. I flew on flight AC851 on the 18 May 2014 and I have to say the cabin crew on this flight were absolutely great they were helpful friendly and cheerful in their work and nothing was too much trouble. They made our flight enjoyable! Food was good for an airline seat comfort was good and although there were some delays before take off this was due to Heathrow ground staff and no fault of Air Canada.,5th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,146
1451,Air Canada customer review,David Carter,Not Verified,"Great word of caution. AC flight may be ""Rouged"" in whole or on connections. AC regular deserve from my experience as an Elite flyer their four stars. Notable AC improvements in customer care on-time efficiency crew attitude and wine selection in business. Rouge is another issue entirely. Take away 4 inches of seat pitch remove IFE seat back TV put you on seats that are ultra thin and hurt you take a 3 by 3 narrow seat and put a pillow in the middle seat and call it Premium. Use underpaid Disney trained staff who wear odd hats smile and try to put their best foot forward but are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers on the plane fighting for overhead bin space and how crowded and unhappy they and you have Rouge. For us it was like travelling in a nice comfy car on one leg and then being put on a cattle truck for the next and for the same price! Never been so comfortable on one or felt so tricked on the next. Maybe we should bring our own iPads and a nice folding chair? Since this was an Air Canada ticket you are forced to share it with Rouge (look on-line Rouge has either subsumed all flights on some routes or is interleaved on others). For this review all stars have been cut in half because of our Rouge experience. Mixing the two is airlines is comparing ""chalk and cheese"" and confounds the star ratings.",2nd June 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,2,0,0,2,146
1452,Air Canada customer review,A Bigelow,Not Verified,YVR-HKG on 777 High Density configuration. Everyone must avoid this 777! Even if this flight was a few hundred dollars less than competition (which it's not) I'd still avoid it. I am Elite Air Canada and would never fly this plane (trying to see if I can change my return flight). Seats are so cramped that it shames low-cost airlines not only you do you not have enough room but the seats are also very uncomfortable the controls are inaccessible (on the armrests) and recline is very limited. Due to extreme high density service is slow and very poor there's no duty free on a 14hr flight! There's absolutely not enough lavatories for the number of people this plane carries. From what I've heard the business class is also horrendous.,1st June 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,2,2,3,0,0,1,146
1453,Air Canada customer review,Kyle Thiel,Not Verified,Our Detroit to Toronto flight was cancelled after being delayed several hours which ensured we didn't have enough time to find another flight to make our Toronto to Munich connection despite originally having a 4.5 hour layover. Air Canada has no physical agents present at Detroit so after finally getting through to customer service we were able to rebook for the next day with an extra layover. The next day we get to Toronto to find out that they rebooked us on an overbooked flight so we actually found an Air Canada agent there to rebook us on a flight for later that night on a different airline. Coming back from Munich our flight was yet again cancelled after being delayed several hours ensuring we had no time to find a different flight. Of course there are no Air Canada agents to talk to in Munich either and the poor Lufthansa agents were terribly confused. Now I'm sitting here at the airport again wearing the same clothes because they refused to give us our checked bags back waiting for our rescheduled flight watching the agents at the gate try to figure out what to do with all of us who have boarding passes from yesterday currently saying we all need to recheck in which will no doubt delay this flight.

1455,Air Canada customer review,MacMillan David,Not Verified,London to Montreal on Air Canada's new high density 452 seat 777-300ER. Check in was quick and boarding was a bit chaotic give huge number of passengers waiting in relatively small gate but priority boarding for business class was OK. Business class seating is new 4 and 6 across in alternating rows. Some seats much better than others so one has to choose carefully. Mine wasn't great with thin armrest on aisle side and was constantly bumped by crew and passengers. Overall business class ambience not great and the cabin felt very cramped given relatively high density of seating. Very large TV screens and good sound reduction earphones. Seats not as good as LH UA BA or pods on AC's older 777's and 767's. Service good by professional crew. Food and wine OK and decent portions and frequent drink rounds.

1460,Air Canada customer review,S Jensen,Not Verified,"Toronto-DC-Toronto in mid-May and paid the $25 per bag fee for checked baggage. Too many ""economy-minded"" passengers didn't want to pay this reasonable fee so opted to bring over-stuffed bags onto the flight as ""carry-on""s. One woman with such a bag PLUS a large backpack so large it could not fit under the seat. These people were not directed by AC staff to check their bags the consequence being that there was insufficient in-cabin overhead bin space causing a delay in boarding of over 20 minutes. This caused us to queue on the runway for over half an hour waiting for clearance from air traffic control. The result - we left DC around the time we were supposed to land in Toronto. Contacted AC regarding this irritation and received an email that the wait-time for a response is twenty working days (yes that's a month!) If I phone to make a complaint the wait-time in the phone queue is anywhere from 35-55 minutes. This was my second AC flight and the second time I was delayed by inefficient staff.

1461,Air Canada customer review,J Ross,Not Verified,HKG-YVR Boeing 777-300 New configuration. A nightmare that even embarrasses the flight crew to apologise for it. I am a 100K Aeroplan member and this dreadful experience led me to avoid Air Canada since. With other airlines upgrading their already superior products one is left to wonder why Air Canada has chosen to downgrade theirs. I can only imagine the plight in economy where an extra seat has been jammed into each row. On a positive note I have discovered the advantages offered by the competition - of which there is plenty. There may be a short term increase in yields as passengers are crammed into airplanes but the damage to long standing customer loyalty will sadly endure.,17th May 2014,,Business Class,,,1,2,1,1,0,0,1,147
1462,Air Canada customer review,A Ross,Not Verified,YYZ-YVR-YYZ this past week enjoyable flights both ways. I am finding myself flying a lot on the 777. The leg room on this plane is great. On my return flight yesterday the airline had to make a last minute aircraft change and we flew home on the 767. This change was handled in a very professional manner. The counter employees were quick to re-assign seats and tried their best to accommodate every ones request. I have flown Air Canada twice in the last 2 months and have had an enjoyable experience both times. People need to realize that we are no longer in the Wardair days and that Air Canada is doing the best they can.,15th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,4,0,0,5,147
1463,Air Canada customer review,A Graupe,Not Verified,YYC-FRA and back on the two-class 9-abreast 777-300ER. The seat was as comfortable as I've ever had in economy with sufficient legroom for me even in a standard row. Service was hit-or-miss. On the way over we had a very friendly cheerful crew but on the way back the flight attendants were very snappy and unbelievably inconsiderate to passengers that didn't speak English or French. The food was mediocre compared to the meals I got on the connecting FRA-MAD leg on Lufthansa which is sort of disappointing for a 9-hour flight versus a 2 hour flight. The selection of wine was worse than Iberia Regional offered on MAD-GRX no less. It's not a huge deal to me I didn't expect to eat and drink like a king but when you look at what other airlines are offering I can't help but feel embarrassed for my national airline. The IFE system was decent with a good variety of TV shows and movies. Unfortunately the in-flight map didn't work on the return segment but that's a very minor complaint. Overall I was fairly pleased with the experience compared to my previous experience with Air Canada within North America.,15th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,147
1464,Air Canada customer review,David Butcher,Not Verified,Flew YVR-MUC on LH and LHR-YVR on AC in May 2014. Have flown BA long haul many times in last year mainly on old 747s. For a while AC had really improved their product making it better than BA. Not any more. The new AC high density 777-300 on the YVR-LHR route is awful In business the Pods are gone. The seat pitch is much reduced. The seat is poorly constructed and difficult to change position. The table is bizarre - spring loaded and very difficult to put back. The lie flat is not comfortable and has no privacy. You have to climb over the aisle passenger to get out. This is a serious serious downgrade and I cant see how they can compete against CX on the HKG route or BA to LHR. In economy its 3-4-3 which looked awful. Premium economy is 2-4-2. the centre rows look very cramped. I should add that the lounge at LHR is the SAS lounge which has very limited range of food/drinks. The staff however were very professional. Overall the experience was much poorer than LH's new business class on the A330. I wont use this plane again by choice. I'll be on BA or VS to LHR.,13th May 2014,,Business Class,,,1,3,2,4,0,0,2,147
1465,Air Canada customer review,E Gergolas,Not Verified,Quickly loosing respect for this airline who seem to find or create loopholes to punish passengers for any kind of loyalty. I have status (Star Alliance Gold) and have issues every time I fly - from check-in staff being rude and to lying about seat availability for windows / exit rows on flights that have empty seats in both categories when you actually squeeze into your assigned middle seat and the limits for when food is free / paid for never seems to include delays on the tarmac - even when they are 5-6 hours long. They changed the rules last year to achieve status and after it was achieved... they changed the rules and benefits again so upgrades that were free in January cost $1000 for Europe flights in February - it's like they have no respect for passengers.,11th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,4,0,0,2,147

I flew from Thunder Bay to Toronto in the most uncomfortable seats imaginable in the back row while the plane was full with Air Canada staff flying in their aisle seats. In Toronto apparently paying for your seat is not enough. I did not have a pre-booked seat so that meant I was a second class citizen due no courtesy or respect from the Air Canada ticket attendant who didn't even want to speak to me until everyone else was on the plane.

Pros: Seat was very comfortable in terms of cushion width and leg room (though I understand the seats tend to be a bit larger on the A330 than other AC aircraft). Flight was on time aircraft was clean FAs were friendly enough. Cons: Food was downright awful - main meal was very dry pasta with red sauce snack before landing was a completely flavorless chicken wrap. IFE had decent selection but played a 2-minute run of advertisements before playing each selection. Comes across as very tacky.

1468,Air Canada customer review,A Amaladoss,Not Verified,YYZ-LHR was rebooked by BA on to this flight as their flight was cancelled due to a bird strike. Check-in very straightforward. Used the Maple Leaf lounge in Terminal 1 close to the E gates. Spacious comfortable lounge but no hot options for breakfast apart from a very sticky oatmeal porridge. Flight was on a B767 with a herring bone 1-1-1 configuration. It felt both spacious and private. The crew were engaging and very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast omelette was rather nice. IFE of a good quality but using the headphones was fiddly because you had to put on the sponge ear covers yourself! Seats are lie flat and quite comfortable-managed a nap of a couple of hours. The serving of lunch was delayed by some turbulence over the Atlantic. The Captain was very reassuring especially as he asked the FAs to be seated as well for about 30 mins. Good choice of champagne and 2 whites and 3 reds. There was a choice of 3 mains-all looked tasty. Arrival was shambolic because of the immigration computer glitch-baggage was waiting when I got to the carousel.

The beef and the pasta were much tastier dishes. Thankfully fresh salad/balsamic dressing has been part of the business meal for a few years. Tasty desserts/cheese plates ensure that no one will starve. The pods are a comfortable way to travel and we always manage to have 4-5 hours of sleep. There's ample storage for shoes iPads etc plus a big bin overhead. There was a large selection of old and new movies to watch.

1470,Air Canada customer review,J De Boer,Not Verified,Flew SYD-YVR business class on 777-200. The seat configuration is not great for couples my husband and I sat in the middle two seats and were divided by a partition and the angle of the seats meant that to speak to each other we both had to turn sideways and backwards. I could eyeball the person across the aisle more easily but the distance was such you couldn't have a quiet conversation thus still not satisfactory when traveling with someone. Not a lot of room to place personal items in easy reach during the flight. Service was excellent there was plenty of courteous and helpful staff. Food was nice 4 choices of main course I enjoyed my fish also the entree prawn salad. I have to agree with previous reviewer the head phones disposable foam ear pieces were very tricky to stretch over the phones easily torn and easily lost when taking the head phones off.

1471,Air Canada customer review,Gordon Nettleton,Not Verified,"This concerns Air Canada's Business Class Service on its international flights. Air Canada has introduced its new seat configurations on its 777 aircrafts. It is a marked change from the ""pods"" that it uses on its 767s. Regrettably the new configurations are horrible. My complaints are not so much about having to sit side by side someone in the rows but rather its the amenities and the way in which the seats work altogether. The flat bed seats are most uncomfortable. The seats do not accommodate one from moving their feet because once the bed is flat your feet go into an area that does not allow for any movement. You must physically remove one foot at a time to adjust your resting position. Headphones in business class are awful. They provide ear bud style head sets but they are cheap and sound quality is awful. You can request an over the ear headphone which they have on board but do not offer unless asked. Sound quality is better but when they deliver the units to you there are sponge coverings that must be affixed over each ear speaker. This task is incredibly difficult! The sponge coverings do not fit well over the oval speakers and the sponge has a tendency to rip! The controls for the seats are located in two locations - one on the table that is used to rest your arms. This of course means unintentional adjustments are made to your seat settings when your arms rest on the controls. The second set of controls are not easy to find at first and are only usable when the seat is in a flat bed mode. I also had difficulty having the bed go into a flat bed mode. The seats seam to get jammed on settings that would not allow the bed to fully extend and it took some time and multiple pressing of buttons to convince the seat to fully extend. Last beef concerns the tray table. Whoever designed this table should be shot! At first the table seems reasonable: press a release button and pop goes the table. Fold it out and you are in business. Now the tricky part - putting the table away. Folding is ok but then you have to align three very faintly marked arrows and then figure out a way to force the table back into its locked position. I couldn't do it and required assistance each and every time. It was interesting to hear from the flight crew that there have been many many complaints about these new seats. Air Canada however is not taking any steps to address these concerns which is too bad. The crew mentioned that the seating was an after thought and that they were not asked for any advice or input on the selection of the consoles. Too bad. I will be going out of my way not to use Air Canada because of this uncomfortable experience. Other airlines like Cathay and Singapore have far better seats and amenities. Use them.",3rd May 2014,,Business Class,,,1,4,3,3,0,0,1,148
1472,Air Canada customer review,P Butler,Not Verified,"AC138 Vancouver-Ottawa. Usual AC crush on boarding with lots of people with too much carry-on no enforcement of carry on policy and insufficient space in aircraft cabin design for carry-on seems to be a universal feature of AC that you have to fight for bin space. Cabin crew managed to pack everyone's stuff in. 6 row seating and only 2 washrooms for about 160 people no doubt maximizes AC revenue when combined with overbooking - but no room to move in the cabin two people can't pass in the aisles without standing on the aisle seat passenger. Seats cramped. Flight safety briefings are now followed by full volume ads for BMW and credit card products. Inflight service then began by cabin staff selling earphones. Chose not to purchase later realized this a wise choice in view of limited inflight entertainment options. Food service - if you're asleep when they come round don't worry - if the cart doesn't wake you by banging your elbow as it comes by you will be shouted at until you do wake up and a menu card is wafted under your nose. AC wouldn't want to miss a sale just because you're sleeping! Being now awake looked at menu which offers ""selection of wines"" - turns out this means red or white one brand each. Ordered pieces of stiff cardboard and plastic paid full bar prices. In future AC would have to be the only carrier on a route before I'd fly them again and I would never recommend them.

We flew out with Lufthansa - excellent service. On the way back we flew with Air Canada. I had pre- selected seats close to the wing (row 27) the B763 has 2-3-2 seating setup so selecting 2x2 was perfect for us. When we checked in at Miami airport we were told our seating had changed for the flight between Toronto and Copenhagen. Our seating was now: me my wife and my son (age 10) moved to the middle section in row 35 and my daughter (age 5) placed on row 14. I tried to talk to 3 different staff members in Miami airport none was interested in helping us. One suggested we could find a passenger ourselves to swap with. When we were boarding they realized it probably wasn't a good idea to place a 5 year old alone and swapped the seating. I am shocked about the lack of service. What shocked me the most is that I tried to talk to 7 different Air Canada staff members. On top of that (which just is minor compared to all the other): Their ""continental breakfast"" was a dry banana cake.

The business class flight attendant was sure to make sure my drinks were always topped up and even went as far as to refer to me by name a very pleasant surprise in economy. The flight crew were friendly and present throughout the entire flight. Multiple water runs occurred. Legroom was generous in the bulkhead row and the cabin was clean and fresh.

Instead a piece of cellophane-covered yellow cloggy sponge slice that tasted of nothing paired with a small sweetened yoghourt. It was such a sad and disappointing closure to my trip. Regarding the holding pattern over Heathrow it was amazingly beautiful but that only made the unpleasant breakfast experience worse!

Pilot explained that the plane was grounded due to technical problems 2 days ago and ever since they were struggling to find replacement planes. Also the incoming plane was delayed due to technical problems. But no information prior to check-in resulted in no chance to rebook thus missing an important meeting and wasting 19 hours at YTO.

1478,Air Canada customer review,D Tomlinson,Not Verified,Return flights on new Air Canada B777 High Density YVR-HKG and YVR-LHR in last month. With the new high density configuration Air Canada has lowered themselves to a truly awful class of business travel. Seats are uncomfortable and cramped controls to recline are finicky and require a lot of to and fro'ing to get seat into lay down position. There is no storage space around your seat for storage of pillow blanket or your shoes. Staff are clearly not happy with new service nor are other frequent passengers. If traveling alone do not take an aisle seat on either side of the cabin - the window seat occupant cannot leave their seat without having you get out of your seat. Cathay and BA much better choices as they are either less costly (or the same price) and you get a personal pod. Will not fly AC again there are much better options on this route.,22nd April 2014,,Business Class,,,1,5,4,3,0,0,1,148
1479,Air Canada customer review,S Moore,Not Verified,My wife and I booked a trip to the Caribbean in May 2013 to travel in early April 2014. We used a popular online service for our flight reservations. On our return trip back home to Michigan we had to go round about through Toronto switching airlines to Air Canada for our half hour last leg home. We arrived at Toronto to find that We had less than an hour to connect flights and our baggage wouldn't be checked through to our final destination so after waiting 25 minutes for our luggage and a long trek through a huge unfamiliar airport we missed our flight. But instead of putting us on the next available flight the attendant at check-in directed us to call ticket information. After about 20 minutes of being on hold we ended up at an information desk and they sent us back to the check-in counter where we encountered a gentleman who proceeded to blame us for the mix up arguing and threatening to charge us $250US to rebook. This went on for some time then after we had given up and were going to pay (again) for the flight he abruptly stopped rebooked the flight told us he was doing us a favor and we were on our way. What an ordeal after about a day and a half of traveling it was a nightmare.,22nd April 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,0,0,3,148
1480,Air Canada customer review,Tal Atkinson,Not Verified,April 3 flight # 1820. return April 17 flight # 1821. Rouge not good. Please do better leaving a seat in the middle open on each row is a bad fix. April 17 flight from Cancun great staff. Much improved. Seat depth and width are the issue. Proud of Air Canada and the Maple Leaf Logo.,19th April 2014,,Business Class,,,1,5,5,4,0,0,3,149
1481,Air Canada customer review,S Ray,Not Verified,We flew LGA-YUL and back on AC. My finance and I flew out separately and returned together. Staff were polite enough in LGA but displayed a consistently lackadaisical attitude. They didn't start boarding the flights until 10 minutes or less before scheduled departure (even though the plane had been at the gate for at least 30 minutes prior) so predictably both flights pulled back from the gate late. My flight then took a 30 minute tour around the taxiways which granted AC has no control over but they provided no updates or anything until we finally started our take off. On the return trip we first ran in to possibly the rudest person working a service job I've ever encountered at YUL. The second AC employee we dealt with was quite nice and apologized for her co-worker. Again at the gate the staff was lackadaisical fumbling around and not boarding the flight until 10 minutes before departure (even though the boarding pass said boarding would start 55 minutes prior to departure and the plane was at the gate for a good 20 minutes at least before boarding started). Luckily it only lead to 5-10 minutes delay on the YUL-LGA trip. On all 3 flights there were no announcements about how or where to pick up baggage when we landed. Overall I feel like we were lucky that our AC experience was only somewhat bad. The general attitude and competency of the AC staff gave me absolutely no confidence that they would have been able to handle any real problems. I'm going back to Montreal again next year and will do my best to avoid AC for that trip and any others I take in the future.,19th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,2,0,0,2,149
1482,Air Canada customer review,R Smithsonite,Not Verified,Winnipeg to Toronto - this flight was the same as for all prior trips on AC. Staff were at best lifeless and indifferent. Some were outright haughty. At the end of the trip one is left with the impression that AC staff are taking their frustrations out on the passengers. I don't have the same experience when I fly the competition (Westjet). AC management might try some positive motivation with their staff before they chase away more customers.,13th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,2,0,0,3,149
1483,Air Canada customer review,B Weiner,Not Verified,YYZ to SYD via YVR in business class aboard 777-200 LR. Toronto to Vancouver leg was standard domestic business class experience. Ok food good entertainment nice service. Vancouver to Sydney was excellent. Nothing to complain about at all. Service was superb. Great meal service and a well stocked galley for between meal snacks. Tried the dim sum chicken breast skewers and fruit - all good. The pod seating is very comfortable. What really impressed was that the washrooms were so clean throughout the entire 15 hour flight. I used them frequently and they were always spotless. Air Canada really stepped it up on their international business class. To give you a comparison I've flown Singapore Airlines a few times and on this long haul flight Air Canada was even better (in both directions). I hope economy class had a good experience as well.,13th April 2014,,Business Class,,,4,5,5,5,0,0,3,149
1484,Air Canada customer review,J Coleman,Not Verified,London Heathrow to Vancouver 28 Feb 2014 and AC855. Terrible customer service our flight was delayed by eight hours then diverted and we were not even told about the diversion until after we boarded and by then it was too late to get on a different flight. No-one apologised staff were rude to passengers who asked for information I've never flown with such a rude group of staff. Our return journey was on time and we were in a higher cabin class yet the staff were still rude both at the airport and on board.,6th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,3,0,0,1,149
1485,Air Canada customer review,C Tang,Not Verified,Mar 16 2014 YVR-HKG and Apr 1 2014 HKG-YVR - Travel in economy class. In-Flight Entertainment is excellent but the seat is terrible narrow and very uncomfortable. Of all these years I have been travelled with Air Canada this high density B777-300 aircraft is the worst pick from Air Canada. I could tell the crews were not happy about it as they walked by warning us the elbow and leg inside the seat as they always hitting the passengers. I would highly not recommend this route to anyone.,6th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,3,2,5,0,0,3,149
1486,Air Canada customer review,T Little,Not Verified,Vancouver to Hawaii flight delayed 2 hours. Hawaii to Vancouver flight delayed 2 hours we also missed our connecting flight so another 2 hour wait. Assigned the two seats on the emergency exit and froze all the way to Vancouver. We are 71 and 73 years old and not able to operate these doors. I paid to choose our seats but for some reason couldn't do that on this flight now we know why. The seats didn't recline and were uncomfortable. We will never fly with Air Canada again.,31st March 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,4,0,0,2,149
1487,Air Canada customer review,Andrew McCubbin,Not Verified,YVR to LHR return. Both flights quite satisfactory even with 100% full plane on return trip. All staff keen and some put out real effort. Two issues: Very poor food on return trip. Not really edible at all and the plane was a few minutes late in LHR with getting a landing slot. We went merrily to the Maple Leaf arrivals lounge for a shower and a bit of food after the flight. We got there at 12.45 and was told it was closed for showers and limited for food. It says it closes at 1.30 and we thought there was plenty of time for both. Staff were lifeless. Very disappointing.,30th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,5,2,5,0,0,4,149
1488,Air Canada customer review,Judy Rump,Not Verified,We recently were on a flight from Los Cabos BCS Mexico to Toronto. We departed Mexico just after noon for our 5 hour flight. Not long after take off the staff proceeded to sell food. We were seated towards the rear of the plane and therefore expected to have slim pickings from the menu. We did not expect a total sell out of meals. We had a choice of a few snack items such as chocolate bar chips twizzlers and nuts. According to staff they sold out after 1st class and had to even sell off staff meals. I think it's unacceptable that the airline cannot better predict the amount of meals that are required for a 5 hour flight.,30th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,2,1,2,0,0,3,149
1489,Air Canada customer review,Paul Singh,Not Verified,I travelled from Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver. Vancouver to Sydney is the longest journey possible. I had many choices through the US but I decided against it and I bought a ticket that was more expensive than other airlines. My experience was horrible. Food was bad staff were rude and I even tried to upgrade and they said that it was not allowed. Last but not the least I strongly recommend other airlines for long distance travel.,28th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,2,2,4,0,0,1,149
1490,Air Canada customer review,Jaydon Baha,Not Verified,Los Angeles - Vancouver full Embraer E190 was a very pleasant flight despite the time late at night. The service was great and very friendly. Overall the aircraft was good and fairly new with spacious seats arrangements of 2 and 2 and great entertainment system (though the TV's could use a bit of improvement). Onboard cafe was overall normal and the menu selection was good. The terminal's Air Canada operated out of were efficient and my bags came out very fast. Turn around time was fast. Things that need improving the plane needed to be a bit cleaner and the boarding lines need to be organized more. But Overall it was one of the best airline experience I had on a trans- continental flight.,27th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,4,0,0,4,150
1491,Air Canada customer review,Peter Davies,Not Verified,"LAX-YYV-CDG on 14 March. Check in good rapid friendly. Boarding take off smooth appreciated the idea of rear passenger loading first saves all the usual hassle why don't others do it after Business of course! Negative was the fact that the ""domestic"" classed flight from LAX to YYV which takes almost 5 hrs - no food was available most of the snacks neither. Very poor considering I had 3 children and 5 hrs is not short. Later on the YYV-CDG leg food was poor and ""breakfast"" was a slice of banana bread...do they think we are all monkeys? Poor and the main reason I will avoid AC in the future even the Canadian Air Transat does better. Flight was otherwise ok staff not overly friendly or young; have done this route regular with Air France KLM United Delta and Lufthansa.",19th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,3,1,3,0,0,4,150
1492,Air Canada customer review,N Cooper,Not Verified,1.5 hours late in leaving London to Vancouver. Not a great deal of information during this wait onboard. Seat uncomfortable with recline not working. Entertainment system broke down but was fixed eventually after a re-boot. Food virtually inedible slop. Staff uninterested and unwelcoming. Return Kamloops to Vancouver to London. Ate at Kamloops as had a delay which was just as well as the food was again disgusting on the long haul flight. Have used this Airline to get to Sun Peaks ski resort for the last 10 years as it is difficult to travel with any other 'joined up' airline with times to suit. i.e. Air Canada to Vancouver then Jazz to Kamloops. Value service and catering all deteriorating. Will most definitely attempt to travel with another airline if possible. Very disappointing.,18th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,2,0,0,1,150
1493,Air Canada customer review,S Maitra,Not Verified,Outward: LHR-YVR (8/3/2014) and Inward: YVR-LHR (16/3/2014). Travelled Air Canada after 7 years and noticed some significant improvements in aircraft interiors and entertainment. Online check-in was simple as was baggage drop. Leg space is below par compared to a BA (for example). Staff service is brusque (no smiles) and food is woeful. How can you serve one hot meal of pasta and then another after 7 hours of just dry cake on a 9 hour flight is mind boggling. Will not fly them if I can help it.,17th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,3,1,4,0,0,2,150

Friendly ticket agents at the gate smiling welcome on both flights. DH8-100 from Quebec to Montreal - coming from Sept-Iles so people were onboard when I got on - flight was 45 minutes and drink service from a friendly attendant. Departed 15 min late and arrived 10 min late - long walk to US gates. E-190 to O'Hare - got upgraded to Biz Class. Awesome friendly attendants on the plane. Nice chicken wrap was serviced and inflight entertainment really good. Air Canada knows how to treat passengers and deliver a great product.,17th March 2014,,Business Class,,,4,4,5,5,0,0,4,150

Air Canada provided a $10 Meal Voucher as a 'goodwill' token. Cheapest sandwich at Pearson Airport $12.99. Return flight MUC-YYZ AC 847 March 14 delayed 2.5 hours.

Paid for extra room seats picked up tickets 2 weeks ahead of time and when checking tickets found our seats had been taken away. No explanation as to why we lost our seats and were put in the cattle car section and were told if we didn't like it we could cancel.

1498,Air Canada customer review,P Smith,Not Verified,LHR-YYZ. On-time departure with arrival 10 mins early in Toronto. Flight crew was friendly and generally efficient but disappeared to the galley for a long period during the middle of the flight. Food was average wine was good. Business class seat wasn't very comfortable and is oriented away from the window.

1499,Air Canada customer review,E Dean,Not Verified,High Density 777-300 YYZ-YVR treated myself to an upgrade to Premium Economy and I must say I was extremely happy after seeing the cattle-car arrangement just behind me. PE is great! Seats are huge like domestic Executive Class on A320's A319's and A321's on AC but only if the upgrade is offered relatively cheap. My one complaint is that there should be a curtain divider between PE and economy and the cabin doesn't feel separated or intimate and noise and crowds spill over into PE. AC's new EnRoute system is a high upgrade over the old high-rez monitors much easier interface and improved maps. Seats are large leather arm-chairs same as Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic small footrest and small cocktail table in armrest. The economy 3-4-3 is just totally unacceptable to a North American consumer who are typically much larger than in other parts of the world. At baggage claim the complaints were loud people all around me talking of the horrid cramped conditions seats that don't breath and suffering passengers. AC get rid of this product it's horrid!! I will avoid at all costs it's no way to treat a human being. I can only imagine this product on a 13 hours HKG trip.,10th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,5,4,3,5,0,0,5,150
1500,Air Canada customer review,A Eric,Not Verified,I am a Million Miler who flies business on long haul with AC. The angle pod seats were a great addition some time ago and provided business passengers with a feeling of value for money-true lay flats reasonable privacy etc. I cannot understand why AC would want to screw this all up with the new high density layouts in both business and economy-the business seats are resulting in mass complaints and mass desertions to other airlines. They downgraded their product to Hong Kong (in economy there are two or three fewer washrooms for 100 more passengers line ups a mile long the toilets are backing up as they are not designed for this volume of passengers. I have never in all my years heard more angry passengers than the Honk Kong to Vancouver AC passengers in any class. For a crass money grab on these routes AC is risking a big revenue loss to Japan airlines Cathay and other Asian airlines and on Europe runs to British Air and others even Lufthansa. This high density move is a complete disaster on the 777's and AC should reconsider. For those of us in the air a lot this change of equipment downgrade is a real choice maker.,10th March 2014,,Business Class,,,1,5,4,4,0,0,2,151
1501,Air Canada customer review,E Dean,Not Verified,Flew AC 883 CPH-YYZ you certainly get back what you give on AC. I always decide to treat the crew like gold smiles and thank you and you get that back. AC 883 was about half full to very lucky to have two seats aisle and window all to myself. I greeted the crew with smiles and they immediately offered my double food two desserts and about an hour later one member brought me a tray with bread and cookies I immediately went to the back and thanked them again. Flight was an ageing 767 but saviour these old birds as you'll never again get the incredibly comfy 2-3-2 configuration again on the 777's and 787's. My one complained on these old planes is the seating near the exit rows gets extremely cold colder then when these planes were new.,10th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,5,5,3,5,0,0,5,151
1502,Air Canada customer review,F Atkin,Not Verified,Flew from YWG to OGG via YYC. Air Canada Express leg from YWG-YYC. Gate agent paged me and offered an exit row instead of my originally assigned Y class seat which was beside a mother and infant. Loved that the gate agent was so thoughtful. Last Minute upgrade purchased from YYC-OGG at an additional cost of $700. Enjoyed the flatbed for the 7 hr flight. Service was OK. Once meal service had concluded J class passengers would have to ask for whatever they wanted by accessing the forward galley were the crew congregated. No moving map on either flight however both flights operated onetime. Confirmed with crew that this may be the last season Air Canada mainline operates to Hawaii as Air Canada Rouge will take over this flying which will not offer flatbed seating. Flew back on United from HNL-YWG via ORD as AC fares for a Y class ticket one way was in excess of $700.00. Purchased a First Class ticket on United for $860.00 was served dinner and breakfast and had no charge for checked bags. Beverage glasses were never left unfilled and water glasses were even topped up while passengers slept. No need to venture to the galley to ask for anything.,6th March 2014,,Business Class,,,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,151
1503,Air Canada customer review,Dorothy Boothroyd,Not Verified,"My husband and I returned to Toronto from Tokyo on Air Canada yesterday. Our trip to Southeast Asia was with Eva Air. We were fortunate enough to fly Business Class (on points) both ways. The similarity ends there. Eva Air was the height of travel luxury - Air Canada definitely was not. From the so-called Welcome Onboard we knew things were different. With the exception of 2 flight attendants on AC the others were diffident at best one of the flight directors downright rude. It seemed that they couldn't wait to get home. Our flight map didn't work. We were told ""too bad'. One of the BC washrooms was out of service from the beginning of the flight. Of course it was helpful to be able to lie flat but the beds were not very comfortable the quilt looked and felt as if it came from Walmart and the travel kit was just okay. The remaining two washrooms were tiny and poorly maintained. As for the food - the lamb dinner was floating in grease the beans were overcooked and the meal was inedible. As for the so-called Business Class service it needs a major overhaul.",4th March 2014,,Business Class,,,2,2,1,2,0,0,3,151
1504,Air Canada customer review,Ronald Kerr-Miller,Not Verified,The new business class cabin on Vancouver to Hong Kong is a big downgrade. The seats go down under the armrests of the seats in front of you so you lie in a narrow casket-shaped space - your legs can't move up and down at all but the part of the lid over you chest and face is open. When the passengers put their seats back up it literally looks like vampires rising out of caskets. It's very cramped and there's no privacy. The herring bone pods were worth the money to me - you got a smidgen of privacy. The new configuration is back to 2 across (ex for a few singleton seats that are always gone already) so you have someone breathing at you from a foot away that you have to crawl over to get to the aisle. I will look for other airlines where AC uses this cabin.,28th February 2014,,Business Class,,,1,5,5,3,0,0,2,151
1505,Air Canada customer review,M Villeneuve,Not Verified,Just flew Air Canada Rouge (Toronto to Montego Bay) for the first time. Had heard horror stories and read the reviews about them so took nothing to chance. We took our own food to eat (which we have done for years with regular Air Canada) and had movies on our laptop to watch rather than the common movie which was being shown on the plane. I had also downloaded their entertainment app on my iPod in advance so could watch their entertainment system as well. Flight down was delayed leaving for about half hour and flight back slightly delayed. Took advantage of their single cart service when it was offered for soft drinks but other than that didn't ask for anything. The flight itself was no worse than some regular Air Canada flights I have taken and we were fortunately we were able to get the bulk head (at an extra cost) so had sufficient leg room. Overall was satisfied with the flight because I expected nothing from them other than flying me to my destination.,24th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,3,0,0,4,151
1506,Air Canada customer review,Samir Akhavan,Not Verified,YYZ to YYC on Feb 14 and back the following day in economy. Both flights operated by 320 Airbus with plenty of legroom good entertainment and decent enough buy on board. I recognize AC is not everyone's favourite airline but I have rarely if ever at all had any major problems. One thing though: I would fly neither Rouge nor the new 777's with ten abreast seating.,24th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,151
1507,Air Canada customer review,D Carter,Not Verified,I am a frequent AC flyer. Short-haul between YVR and Edmonton or Calgary. From not happy with them - over the last few years they have improved markedly. On-time is very good and so is customer service. I think they deserve the 4 stars. Last flight was Calgary-YVR. Airport is good shape and new massive addition almost ready Gates staffed with well dressed and smiling (YES smiling) staff. Travelled on a business class upgrade. Flight on-time attendant greeted me by name with great courtesy food service just ok (same two light entrees seem to repeat a lot) wine offerings excellent and served promptly carefully and with a little style. Hot towels very hot seats ok took my coat hung it up and returned before landing.,24th February 2014,,Business Class,,,3,5,4,4,0,0,4,151
1508,Air Canada customer review,Mike Tigg,Not Verified,YYZ-LAX-YYZ AC792. Consistently late departure on this route either with excuses of maintenance luggage having to be removed or loaded passengers tied up in customs weather etc.. This time all of the above except weather. 763 with no space pod seating that is really showing it's age and lack of cleaning. Inedible breakfast mash of soggy pancakes and rubber sausage. Crew pleasant enough but given very low grade product to work with. On return the crew were efficient but perfunctory and the food just as awful. When I asked how well the beef was done the attendant replied that they didn't know as all they were told by the company was to put it in the galley oven and cook for twenty minutes same for all the meals. Very poor product for the money.,22nd February 2014,,Business Class,,,2,3,1,3,0,0,1,151
1509,Air Canada customer review,S Summers,Not Verified,EZE-SCL-YYZ. Feared the worst after reading other reviews however must admit I was very satisfied with this flight. Good friendly service regular drinks distribution during the night decent inflight entertainment and acceptable snacks and meals including complementary alcohol which isn't always the case on NA carriers. On time departure and early arrival at YYZ. Glad the older two-class 777-300ERs are used on this route rather than the newer high density aircraft.,20th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,4,0,0,5,151
1510,Air Canada customer review,Michael Carter,Not Verified,YYZ-NRT in Y class. I take this flight several times per year. It is a convenient direct flight from Toronto to Tokyo. This flight left on time (actually departing the gate a few minutes before the scheduled noon departure time) and we were in the air at 12:09 with no lengthy runaway or taxiing delays. Arrived a few minutes early in Tokyo. To me this flight is a notch above the standard AC product. They seem to be a little more attentive on their transpacific flights and the flights generally have a good on time performance. Service consists of full meal shortly after takeoff snack about 6 hours later (noodle cup/sandwiches) and breakfast prior to arrival. Drinks (including alcohol) are complimentary. In summary a good flight with a reasonable price and good service.,20th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,4,0,0,5,152
1511,Air Canada customer review,Vineet Bapat,Not Verified,Zurich to Toronto (Flight 879 on Feb. 13) on a rather ageing tired Boeing 767 - however it was not a full flight so we could easily change our assigned bulkhead seats to two by the window in an exit row - which afforded us great legroom. FAs were wonderful - a senior crew - very welcoming helpful and chatty. Likewise the pilot was great fully informing and updating passengers of a slight delay due to a technical glitch and later alerting us to a great view of the southern tip of Greenland when we flew over it. After an equally long flight from Mumbai in the rather cramped seating on a Swiss A330 this flight was a spacious delight. Food was OK AVOD was good with a wide selection of movies music and TV shows. The FA selling duty free items undertook the extra effort to locate what I wanted to buy when he could not find it on the cart. Not a commonly expressed sentiment but the crew on this Air Canada flight went above and beyond the call in providing a level of service seldom encountered in the economy cabin!,20th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,4,0,0,4,152
1512,Air Canada customer review,Cora Martin,Not Verified,IAH to YYZ to PEK to IAH. Flew economy in January check-in at IAH was fine and smooth so was the boarding process. Only one major delay on the last leg of the flight. But during the first flight from IAH to YYZ the FA was incredibly rude to my family when we asked about the drink offerings. While chewing gum she blatantly told us that all we got is soda juice and water. The flight from YYZ to PEK wasn't all that great either. Flight attendants yelled at one of my family members when we tried to put our bags into the overhead bins. The bags weren't even that large! They fit in the bag size check at the gate we checked twice! The only positive experience on Air Canada was on my last leg of the flight from YYZ to IAH. The plane had been delayed for nearly two hours due to weather which was understandable and downgraded to a smaller jet. One of the women on-board turned belligerent when told by a flight attendant that there wasn't any food available to purchase. The flight attendant offered to give the upset woman her dinner but she refused and remained inconsolable. What to take out of my experience: Don't fly Air Canada unless you absolutely have to and use this airline as a last resort. Avoid this airline at all costs.,18th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,3,0,0,2,152
1513,Air Canada customer review,Julien Marin,Not Verified,Just flew with Air Canada Rouge for the first time. I've been a dedicated Air Canada flyer for many years with Status alternating between Elite and Super Elite. Rouge is a big step down for their regular flight service: reduced legroom uncomfortable chairs inexperienced flight attendants. The lady next to me was not able to be served in French so I had to act as the translator for the attendants this was unacceptable! The Entertainment system changed to an App or browser-based system. I'm not opposed to this but it would be much better if they provided a system on which I can mount my tablet rather than staring down at the table-top the whole flight. Moreover if you have an Ipad you will need to download the app ahead of the flight (or have the Google Chrome browser installed) otherwise you won't be able to view movies onboard. TV viewing will still work through the regular browser (not sure why TV and Movie streaming would be all that different but anyhow). They should offer the capability of downloading the require app (or Chrome) from the plane's entertainment system directly.

1514,Air Canada customer review,J Craig,Not Verified,"Saint John NB to Cancun Feb 7th and will not fly with Air Canada Rouge again. 4 hour delay in Toronto not due to weather and no explanation to passengers for the reasons for delay. 4.5 hour flight with no hot meal available - experienced the same on the way back on Feb 15. Seats were exactly a coke can and a half between edge of my seat and back of next. I am 5'8"" and my husband is 6'0"" and we were very uncomfortable. No TV and music unless you want to download app and watch on your cell phone. You can rent an ipad for $10 but my experience on the way down and the way back was that everyone around me had problems with them. I'll pay more next time and be able to move my legs.",18th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,3,1,1,0,0,1,152
1515,Air Canada customer review,K Yount,Not Verified,I recently spent between $3000 and $4000 for 3 seats on Air Canada for a vacation to the United Kingdom for my wife sister and me. It was important for all of us to sit together. When I tried to get seat assignments their computer system did not work. I had to call instead and spent much time on the phone getting it done. We made the flight to London and were served a small breakfast and I was skipped. On the flight home we were shunted from one departure gate to another. On our third different one the computer system would not work and we were told we would have to be moved yet again when it finally kicked in. As we were boarding our final flight the stewardess pulled my sister from her seat and gave it to another person. I protested and asked how that could happen and we were told that a husband and wife who had not bothered to reserve adjacent seats had asked for my sister's reserved seat and they just gave it to them breaking up our family group to do so. We will never fly Air Canada again.,17th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,2,0,0,3,152
1516,Air Canada customer review,Paxton Kim,Not Verified,Whilst most elements of the flights we took with Air Canada were acceptable rather than outstanding there were two elements that were really poor. Firstly the entertainment system was not working on one 7hr flight and the first stewardess just said she'd look into it but didn't. The second steward admitted they knew it was broken. The real issue though is that the only recompense offered was 5% off our next Air Canada flight. The second issue was the rude check in staff at Vancouver airport - not conducive to generating repeat business. The sooner the Middle and far Eastern airlines get a firm foothold into North America the better.,17th February 2014,,Business Class,,,3,2,3,1,0,0,3,152
1517,Air Canada customer review,Barr Peter,Not Verified,Boeing 777 W (HD) Toronto-Vancouver February 6 in economy. The 10 abreast layout is awful cramped hard and uncomfortable seats I will not travel in this layout again. Leather does not breath. Other passengers in my area voiced opinions that this is not an experience to be repeated. I am a loyal million mile member of AC but this layout and AC Rouge which I have used once and will not repeat for the same reason - too crowded is just too uncomfortable and I will shop other airlines for better seating or just stay home.,17th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,3,0,0,2,152
1518,Air Canada customer review,Vladyslav Alexeyenko,Not Verified,AC151 Toronto - Vancouver. The only good thing was the online check-in through Air Canada's iPhone app I was lucky enough that there was one exit row seat (has extra legroom) that no one purchased off at extra cost or checked-in earlier so I got that. Apart from that everything else was quite bad. The staff were not attentive. You ask them something they promise they will get back to you then they forget. When you click the button to call the attendant no one ever comes even though they walk by. As usual no food on domestic flights only drinks. The plane was dusty as usual.,17th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,4,0,0,3,152
1519,Air Canada customer review,Caldentey Juan,Not Verified,I recently flew SCL-EZE-SCL economy class. Relatively new 777-300. Good flights average legroom and recline.

1523,Air Canada customer review,Susan Marshall,Not Verified,Just returned from Hawaii using Air Canada and never again. We got to the airport in Vancouver to find that the flight was going to be 3 hours late leaving they could have let us know by text or at least by email. The only compensation was that once on board we got the ear phones which usually cost $3 free! The seats I had booked had now been reassigned to someone else no explanation about that so we were cramped up in the last row where my reading light did not work. We took our own sandwiches as I refuse to buy their expensive food. Coming back we did not get anything not even a drink on the flight from LA. Also no blankets or pillows.,11th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,2,0,0,1,153
1524,Air Canada customer review,Sheppard Chad,Not Verified,Flew Air Canada rouge to Orlando from Toronto Jan 25 2014. We will never use this airline again from now on we will fly into Tampa and drive to Orlando. Flight was delayed to and from while the staff whom could use some PR training assured us they hardly ever have delays such as this. Seating was cramped and uncomfortable and the staff on ground and inflight seemed rude and unprofessional unlike anything we have ever experienced. They even tried sending my 5 year old from the washroom at the front of the plane to the rear as not to disturb the people in so called first class. First class meaning they were separated from the rest of us with a curtain falling down and enjoyed a drink of cola while we had water because they ran out of pop part at the back of the aircraft.,10th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,3,1,0,0,1,153
1525,Air Canada customer review,Jake McCall,Not Verified,Jan 18 my wife son and I flew to Sarasota. The trip down was ok although we've never encountered such uncomfortable seats as that flight. The trip back on Feb 1 was awful. We arrived at Sarasota early expecting to catch the flight at 6pm-ish back to Toronto. When asked if the flight was on time the attendants answered 'no it'll be leaving Toronto an hour later than scheduled.' As time went by it became clear that not only was the flight not going to leave an hour late from Toronto it was actually in transit from Orlando to Toronto. Eventually the flight (1881) arrived in Sarasota at roughly 11pm and after disembarking passengers and cleaning left at roughly 11.30pm. The flight eventually arrived in Toronto by now it's roughly 2.30am and everyone is exhausted. Eventually we reached our home in downtown Toronto at roughly 4am. We live in a digital age they had my email and phone contact details. Did they ever have the efficiency or courtesy to send a text? Of course not.,7th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,153
1526,Air Canada customer review,A Price,Not Verified,January 20 out of Victoria to Vancouver. Vancouver to Los Cabos. Return flight January 27 Los Cabos to Vancouver with a connector to Victoria that was cancelled due to fog. It would have been nice for a disclaimer to be printed on E-ticket - no complimentary food. Lovely menu card with only 2 to 3 items actually on the plane. Expensive! Flew Air Canada 12 yrs ago flew again this January 2014 - it will be another 12 yrs before we fly Air Canada again.

1528,Air Canada customer review,S Meler,Not Verified,On 7/1/2014 my connecting flight from Montreal to Brussels was delayed and then subsequently cancelled and rescheduled for the next day. We were made to wait board disembark and eventually to collect our baggage told to sleep in the airport with a thin blanket in freezing temperatures and to check in yet again the following day. As I was in transit this was even more taxing. Air Canada should have provided passengers with meal vouchers/food and hotel accommodation. Before boarding (after 4 hours of waiting) a few parents with young children asked for some water and sandwiches for their children. Their requests were flatly denied. I approached the purser to ask for water and something to eat when we had finally boarded after hours of waiting but I was impolitely brushed off and made to feel greedy even though I had been travelling for 12 hours at that point and was starving. After we were finally informed that the crew were no longer legal and that we had to disembark and spend the night in the airport we were informed that there were no available hotel rooms. I have never encountered such a blasé attitude towards passenger comfort. To add insult to injury there was no vegetarian meal (as I had requested months in advance).,4th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,3,0,0,1,153
1529,Air Canada customer review,Sakuragi Hana,Not Verified,I've flown with Air Canada numerous times and have noticed a general improvement in staff service. That being said my flight from Vancouver to Seoul on New Year's Eve was a little uncomfortable. The sinks were blocked off with aluminium foil and there was no running water. Instead there was a box full of antiseptic towelettes which was thoughtful. However the mere thought of how many unwashed hands went in the box frightens me. Also my inflight entertainment system was not working even after it was rebooted. I could not watch anything during the rather long flight. I understand that technical difficulties happen but this was not the first time.,28th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,1,0,0,3,153
1530,Air Canada customer review,M McLeod,Not Verified,YYZ-YQR-YEG on 1 Jan. An unusual routing but the non-stop YYZ-YEG flights were hundreds more. Got on our E190 took off and they could not retract the slats so we landed after about a half hour flying around over TO. Plane declared unserviceable so they found another which would be ready in a couple of hours which would mean I missed my connection. 34 people headed to Edmonton and Calgary were thrown at Regina with no advance warning to speak of I was first in line at the desk in YQR and got out the next morning on the 0900 flight to YEG but many others were delayed until late that evening because what few flights there were out of Regina west were booked solid for the holiday.,28th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,1,2,4,0,0,3,154

FAs had no idea passengers had to pay for checked luggage were surprised when overhead racks were full when only a third of the passengers boarded. The rest of us were delayed boarding for twenty minutes. I checked in flight movies before trip but couldn't watch anything on my android device and there were no iPads to rent.

1533,Air Canada customer review,Michael Dielissen,Not Verified,I flew from YYZ-YFC on January 9 two days after the shutdown due to weather at YYZ. The check-in was very busy however there were staff on hand to help out. The plan pushed back on time however a teenager felt sick as we were taxiing to the runway and did not quite make it to the washroom on time. We needed to go back to the terminal to get the cabin cleaned. The delay was about 1.5 hours however I have to commend the flight crew on handling the situation with tact and compassion. I hope if I ever fall ill on a plane I get treated the same way. During the delay the flight crew gave out water and gave constant updates and communication. They performed very well considering the circumstances.,20th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,5,2,1,0,0,5,154
1534,Air Canada customer review,Alasdair Clarke,Not Verified,"Flew from London Heathrow to Toronto via Montreal - our entertainment system did not work. When I asked a flight attendant for help they replied sharply ""We are a travel company not an entertainment company"". So I asked another flight attendant who was equally as rude. We were offered a flight with a time of only 50 minutes to connect to our next leg. This is undoable anyway we thought surely? But when our flight arrived 45 minutes late it caused all sorts of stressful complications. On return back to London from Toronto our flight was initially delayed by 4 hours but only pushing in half hour increments. So very frustrating. Short-staffed and totally unhelpful the staff were cleared stressed and it showed. We finally made it onto the plane on which we sat for 3 hours before being told to get off and come back 14 hours later as there was a problem with the plane (they had put water into a freezing cold plane which froze in the pipes expanded and burst). No hotels or food available. Shocking service. I understand that the weather was bad but all these problems could have been simply avoided.",20th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,2,0,0,1,154
1535,Air Canada customer review,Hottola Petri,Not Verified,In Dec-Jan 2014 I flew 4 legs on Air Canada Munich-Toronto-Miami and Miami-Montreal-Frankfurt each of them delayed with a total of 35 hours. All delays were controllable apparently being caused by shortage of staff in airport operations. Being stuck in Montreal airport for 24 hours I got a Holiday Inn voucher but the meal vouchers did not actually cover meals unlike with other airlines' passengers staying at the hotel. Had to stand three hours in a line of five people to get the hotel voucher at the Air Canada counter at the Pierre Trudeau. For a lunch voucher I got a small cup of Pepsi from a tap and water no food. The way the airline struggled with computer maintenance (delay of 4+ hrs from Montreal to Frankfurt) was frightening in terms of flight security. No compensations no apologies but major loss of time and money. Had to buy new tickets for the last leg home.,15th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,1,0,0,1,154

1537,Air Canada customer review,O Wood,Not Verified,My first time flying Air Canada in a while YVR to LHR and back. First of all my ticket price was the cheapest out of other possible competitors. The seats had comfortable leg room and I didn't feel cramped. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. Also the food wasn't bad. I was pretty happy to have got ice cream for the first time on a flight. Drinks were served 3 or 4 times throughout the flight as well.

1538,Air Canada customer review,K Otto,Not Verified,Santiago - Toronto. There was a problem with my ticket but the airport ticket office agent was sincere and thorough dissolving the stress and resolving the issue with a smile. Air Canada uses American Airlines' Admiral's Club in Santiago which is very pleasant but quite full at night. The gate was crowded and announcements were difficult to hear but boarding was orderly and efficient. The cabin crew was outstanding on this packed overnight flight. And this makes all the difference. Welcoming friendly sincere. We pushed back within 15 minutes of departure time. I opted for the full dinner. While the food itself was average the service was very attentive (this crew hustled!) and the wine selections were surprisingly good. The IFE system had a wide range of choices and was fairly intuitive to use. The bathrooms appeared worn but were clean. The lie flat seat (3D) is very comfortable. Breakfast was a disappointing rubbery omelette but I appreciated being able to sleep until shortly before landing. The breakfast buffet in the Maple Leaf Lounge was very pleasant the receptionists were gracious and there was no wait for a shower room to freshen up before my connecting flight. Bottom line: a very pleasant cabin environment warm crew and comfortable night's sleep.,13th January 2014,,Business Class,,,4,5,2,4,0,0,4,154
1539,Air Canada customer review,M Tushishvili,Not Verified,I had flights Paris-Montreal-Paris. This is the worst experience in my 14 years of travelling. The leg room and general scope of the seating is just awful and unacceptable. The plane is B777 with new seating capacity 3x4x3 instead of 3x3x3 (previous configuration) with a new black cover. The seats are so narrow that it is impossible to move even fingers. It is so annoying that the trip becomes nightmare. Air Canada has introduced these seats into three B777. I hope that they will re-consider these inhuman upgrades. The food as usually is not eatable. Staff was excellent.

1541,Air Canada customer review,J Chang,Not Verified,YVR to YCG (Vancouver/Castlegar) return at Christmas/New Year on DeHavilland Dash 8. Both our flights to and back were cancelled twice not because of Air Canada but due to snow and fog in Castlegar. As a result we missed Christmas there as originally planned. Both flights were surprisingly pleasant with lots of legroom on the plane and fantastic on board service. In fact the service on board this little plane was more attentive than my executive first class flying YVR/HKG return three months ago.,10th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,3,0,0,4,155

For breakfast we thought we would order the pancakes as it would seem that this would be impossible to mess up. These were inedible. When I checked into our return flight to Sydney I requested an extra bag and provided all my credit card details at the time. Despite this we were charged for an extra bag at the airport. In essence these flights both to and from Sydney to Vancouver were the worst customer service experiences I have received flying anywhere in the world.,9th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,1,1,3,0,0,1,155

The seats were comfortable and the food was good but nothing to rave about. Flight 2 hours delayed leaving BRU due to heavy thunder and lighting and I missed my connection in YUL before even leaving BRU. I mentioned this to the FA and when I went to recheck my bag in YUL after customs my boarding pass for the next flight to YVR was waiting for me. On the return YUL-BRU leg the service was a bit rushed and it seemed like the FAs just wanted to get it over with and hang out in the galley. I also noticed a certain haughtiness among Air Canada's FAs on international routes. They're the top of the heap seniority-wise in the company and they know it.,7th January 2014,,Business Class,,,4,4,4,5,0,0,5,155
1545,Air Canada customer review,W Pura,Not Verified,"I just returned from a a month long trip throughout east Asia with the major part of trip - across Canada to Vancouver and then across the Pacific with Air Canada. I have done this trip many times in the last few years but this year was particularly bad. I am a tall person and the tiny regional jet to Vancouver was bad enough with cramped seating and small overhead storage but the long haul across the Pacific was particularly uncomfortable. Clearly AC can order their planes with the seating configs they prefer so with 40-50 seat rows they can easily squeeze in another row in by trimming off a 1/2"" from each row making leg room just that little bit less. Heading out from Vancouver the food was decent but the movie selection was pretty poor. No major current releases and a lot of older stuff. As a result of travelling extensively in the Asia region I must have been on 6 or 7 airlines and when it came time to head home to Canada I had plenty to compare Air Canada to. When it comes to national carriers like Egyptair (Jakarta to Bangkok) or Thai Air (Bangkok to Shanghai) Air Canada doesn't even come close. On the return flight to Canada the plane was an older B767 with the same cramped seating as before. When I checked out the movies they were the same ones that were listed over a month earlier. This time the food was really bad. I usually eat what the airlines provide given it was such a long trip but this time I had to push it away unfinished. Somewhere during the night they passed out some tasteless sandwich rolled up in a plastic wrapper. It is shameful for Canada's national carrier not to have the best on such a crucial route for international business. I expect to be making this trip again and I will make every effort to make my connections with another carrier.",6th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,3,1,2,0,0,2,155
1546,Air Canada customer review,J Bennett,Not Verified,Arrived at Toronto and was told onward flight to Sudbury was ok so proceeded to hand in baggage for connection. Later we found that the flight was in fact cancelled and they then refused to give our bags bag. We were told by Air Canada to go to Section N. There were people here who had been in the queue for 4 hours not having an idea what they were queuing for and later finding out it was in fact for hotels not flights. After calling redial for 2 hours we gave up got a hotel ourselves and proceeded without our bags. When I rang air Canada they told me to go back to the airport if I needed them urgently. Our return flight from Sudbury was also cancelled and flight to London delayed heavily both without any notice or customer communication from Air Canada. We had also been told that if we required a special meal there was only one meal available on the first flight. I rang once being on hold for an hour the second for two hours and both without response. When I got to Pearson airport I immediately asked if something could be done about it the Air Canada person told me it's too late it has to be 24 hours before. When I told her I had been on hold for the amount she said there was nothing she could do about it. There was not even an incline of understanding from her or an eagerness to help me in any way whatsoever. Will never travel with them again!,6th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,2,0,0,1,155

1548,Air Canada customer review,W Bohlen,Not Verified,Flight from Vancouver to Brisbane. We paid extra for exit seats to get extra legroom. At Vancouver airport we were given our boarding passes and found we were sitting nowhere near our paid seats and not even sitting together. We complained at the counter and a very rude woman behind the counter said that that was tough luck. Lots of other passengers were complaining about the same thing. I kept complaining long enough so we eventually got the seats we paid extra for. The food on the flight was just horrible and nobody could guess what it was it was just stodge. FA's were rude and unhelpful. The plane was old the seats uncomfortable for a 15 hour flight. It was however cheap. Next time I'll pay the extra to fly with a decent airline.,2nd January 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,3,0,0,3,155
1549,Air Canada customer review,J Guan,Not Verified,Winnipeg to Vancouver to Shanghai return trip. Flew this trip numerous times before. Nothing too special until on AC026 from PVG to YVR. The crew did their best to make you feel at home. A couple of shortcomings to mention: 1) AC025 on Dec. 20 the second meal was not fully hot. 2) AC026 on Dec. 31 flight data were not available on personal screen.

1550,Air Canada customer review,Martin Sullivan,Not Verified,Took my first flight on Rouge on Dec 27: Toronto to Orlando. It was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken on AC. There is no room between seats - must be designed for short small people not someone who is 6 feet tall. Seemed like everyone on the flight was complaining. If this continues Rouge will be a total failure. I travel 100000+ miles on AC but will choose another airline if I have to take a Rouge flight.

Add to this a de-icing debacle and on arrival at Toronto found my seat had been given away on my connecting flight even though I was 10 mins ahead of departure.

1552,Air Canada customer review,L Rheinberger,Not Verified,Flew on AC554 on 27 Dec. Flight was pretty good: YVR-LAX. My only complaint about this airline is the prices that are almost $1200 o/way for 2 adults / 2 children then $150 for baggage is a bit steep. Make sure your flight attendant doing PA's is able to speak clear English not broken English as it is very difficult to understand what they are saying.

After flying Air Canada once I can be sure I will not do it twice. The plane was far from clean at one point I lost my glasses and needed to lift the seat up to see if I had dropped my glasses under the seat I knew the dirtiness of the plane was not a fluke under the seat was filthy as well. The food was awful. Truly disappointed.,29th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,2,0,0,1,156
1555,Air Canada customer review,Rouzbeh Zadeh,Not Verified,Charges for everything automated flight bookings with connections with 1 hour time mixed in with frequent delays hold shorts and breakdowns. Today I flew from Orlando first flight was Rouge with 40 minutes delay. Got to Toronto and ran for my life to get my checked bag and make my Ottawa flight staff were surprised I made it. Flight landed in Ottawa and had to change the gate first stuck In traffic for 20 mins than break problem for 30 meanwhile we had to put up with barking pets in cabin constant bilingual announcements and other annoying derails.,23rd December 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,3,1,3,0,0,2,156
1556,Air Canada customer review,Graham Wise,Not Verified,We flew London to Quebec via Montreal and poor service began before we boarded the flight. We checked in online selected our seats printed our boarding passes checked our luggage in and when we got to the gate they told us we could no longer sit in our allocated seats. We specifically requested the seats as we were travelling with an infant. On the plane the seats are cramped the cabin staff generally unhelpful and rude insisting we take our full meal service even though we had an infant on our lap. As it was it didn't matter as the food was of a very poor standard. The inflight entertainment system clunky and limited choice the touch screen system not working effectively meant passengers behind constantly banging the screens and your seats trying to get the system to work. No seat belts are provided for infants either for take off or landing. This is an airline that seems to be operating a decade behind most others. I will never fly with them again. The trip from Montreal to Quebec was even worse but found out later it was not AC but Jazz.,23rd December 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,2,0,0,1,156
1557,Air Canada customer review,Farouk Mogheth,Not Verified,Not entirely certain why Air Canada calls itself a legacy carrier. Flew New York Newark to Vancouver and then later on to Los Angeles. Payment for checked in luggage on an international flight is unacceptable. Offering no food (only for purchase) for a 6+ flight is unacceptable. Ground male staff in Vancouver (flight to LAX) was extremely rude and arrogant to most passengers including an elderly gentleman who was confused about payment for luggage. Planes are spotless and its a complete shame since the onboard crew were simply perfect with their service as well as attention to security (far superior to any US airline I used in the last 3 weeks on my USA/Canada tour). No value for money for sure. My future flights will be take in Asian/European carriers to ensure the full service that is expected as a standard.,23rd December 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,5,1,4,0,0,2,156
1558,Air Canada customer review,Clive van Rensburg,Not Verified,Never fly Rouge - I couldn't sit upright. I had to angle my legs for 3 hours because there was almost no space between seats. At check in they ding you $25 per bag so most people try to take it as hand luggage. That causes delays when loading passengers as size rules are not enforced. Plus pay for food and pay for entertainment. Nickel and diming at every turn. I am flying any other airline except this one.,23rd December 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,156
1559,Air Canada customer review,Ruth Balaban,Not Verified,I fly usual once a year from Toronto via Munich to Izmir/Turkey. All flights have always been enjoyable and the Air Canada crew was just wonderful. Last August the same except: The food was lousy. I rather take my own food in the future. Returning to Toronto the crew did not have enough time to collect the trays and to hand out immigration papers. The crew make a flight a pleasure or a horror.,20th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,5,5,2,4,0,0,5,156
1560,Air Canada customer review,Aldwin Ragoonath,Not Verified,AC should spend more to improve their food quality on international flights. On a recent trip to India the food served was below international standard on my trip from Germany we travelled with AC partner Lufthansa the food was good very good vs. AC bad. However the entertainment service is better with AC.,20th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,4,1,5,0,0,3,157
1561,Air Canada customer review,Jane Jamieson,Not Verified,AC Rouge to Samana (Dominican) December 8th returning the 15th 2013. I had never heard of 'Rouge' but was happy that I was flying AC with my 2 boys as they enjoy the TV's in the individual seats and AC is fairly reliable (based on about 4 decades of brand loyalty). I was disturbed to discover that they had taken all the TV's out of the individual seats and we could only access the in-flight entertainment if 1) we had known to download the app before we got on the plane as it won't download on an android phone. 2) Had an I/OS phone or Ipad or 3) rented an Ipad for $10 in flight - which would have amounted to $30 x 2 for the return flight. Staff appeared between about 20 and 25 years old and very immature and unable to make any decisions without asking the 'senior' attendant. They sounded rather robotic and lacked any sense of humour. The pilot never spoke on the way back we had some turbulence and we never heard from him. They offered us 2 free Ipads because I was unimpressed with their inability to entertain people without phones but the system was slow and unresponsive. Flight attendants disappeared for about 40 minutes off the top of the flight - nowhere to be found - very unprofessional. I paid more for my trip to Samana than virtually everyone I spoke to - and they flew other airlines that offered free meals and wine - we got nothing - and only 2 drinks on a 5 hour flight. Plane was delayed at the airport in Samana and then we had to wait about 35 minutes at our gate for a Sunwing plane to move out. I wish I had flown with Sunwing.,17th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,1,1,1,0,0,1,157
1562,Air Canada customer review,M Jest,Not Verified,"Copenhagen-Toronto on a worn out 767-300 though slightly cleaner than the one I travelled on the other direction in May. The 767 has just become outdated cramped and too small for 8+ hrs flights. Adorable lightning in the cabin though. Barely room for carry-on luggage and the wall was freezing! My travel companions IFE did not work (decided to sleep instead). However a few pros as well: Meal was delicious! Staff was nice brought drinks several times. Flight on time excellent connection to LaGuardia (but made it only because of nice AC-staff bringing us in front of the US-immigration line. I have to say the experience on the AC 777-300ER Frankfurt- Montreal in May was somewhat nicer. Wonderful aircraft with lots of space (the ""old"" 3-3-3 seating in economy) and very nice interior service level fine.",13th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,2,0,0,5,157
1563,Air Canada customer review,S Greenhalgh,Not Verified,Flew Vancouver to Sydney November 2013 in a 777. What a great experience. The most space I've had on a long haul flight. Service was efficient and friendly and price was very low. Only slight criticism was the food which was pretty ordinary. All in all though I have no hesitation in recommending Air Canada.,13th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,157
1564,Air Canada customer review,Bruce Oliver,Not Verified,"This was my first experience with Rouge. My biggest concern and the main reason for the low rating is the training and comportment of the cabin crew. They were all young and obviously inexperienced. The boarding through two doors was completely bungled chaotic because proper procedures were not followed. I heard ""boarding completed"" reported twice at separate times so obviously there was confusion. They giggled their way through the safety announcements as if they were a private joke. I was left with a very distinct feeling that in case of emergency this crew would be no help at all in evacuation or other procedures. I have never felt that way on a commercial flight before. The Rouge design seems to be on the ""hipster"" model with banter such as ""you will get busted!"" referring to smoke detectors in the washrooms. Fair enough I guess flights do not have to be sombre to be safe I know from experience. But this needs to be better delivered in the Rouge case. There needs to be an adjustment of crew conduct related a better show of competence. The presence of a more mature (but cheerful!) crew manger would be a big help. I'm sure these are nice deserving young people who work hard and they are trying to make a cramped flight feel lighter. However the balance is not there for me at this point and I just felt generally on my own in case of emergency. I have always felt good about Air Canada and recommended it highly. Rouge needs some rethinking before I can say the same.",12th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,3,1,1,0,0,2,157
1565,Air Canada customer review,Seth Martin,Not Verified,"YMM-YYZ-YMM weekly. Usually A319 sometimes A320 seldom E190 high vacation traffic season A321. Check in agents unfriendly Food poor Seats cramped and its always hot on the plane in either direction! Most passengers seem to over do it when it comes to their carry on baggage. This should be policed a lot better. I always only travel with a laptop bag and often there is no room left in the overhead storage compartments. I blame AC for this as they charge for extra check in luggage forcing its passengers to bring on a second carry on. YMM airport waiting area at gates is unacceptable! Pack 125 people in to an area designed for 50 people - standing room only. I hate flying this route but its the best connection to get home. My biggest complaint has to do with the temperature on the plane it is always way to hot to be comfortable. I always ask them to turn down the heat in the cabin but it hardly changes. What could AC do better? Start by asking for feed back from its customers hand out customer review cards to be collected at the end of a flight. Change the menu to higher quality food. Turn the heat down. Charge for the bathroom (Coin Operated) this would reduce the amount of traffic up and down the aisle just after the ""Fasten Seat Belt"" sign goes out 10 minutes in to the flight. AC has a lot to learn about customer service!",12th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,2,1,3,0,0,1,157
1566,Air Canada customer review,S Klass,Not Verified,GRU-YYZ-LGA. Checked in online and used the bag drop counter at GRU. Check in staff was super friendly and fast. Boarding the 777 was via stairs after being bussed to the plane according to seat rows. The gate area seemed too small for the 2 big flights leaving was hot and crowded. But that's GRU. Completely full flight. We ended up leaving 50 mins late thanks to passengers who didn't realize the gate change. Once airborne crew set to work quickly with dinner and drinks. Food quality was better than on the outbound from Toronto. Crew worked hard but some without any smiles. Same seat experience as on my outbound. Cushion felt hard and worn so pretty uncomfortable for the long haul. Movie selection didn't seem to have changed from the previous month. Arrived a little late in Toronto went through all the US customs screening etc and found our flight to EWR had been cancelled due to weather. The customer service agent we then dealt with was really just great. Friendly concerned and patient - quickly booked us on an alternate to LGA. She called their baggage people to ensure our bags would be transferred accordingly. This flight was scheduled to depart only about 45 mins later than our original. However after boarding we were informed by the captain that we'd be on the ground for under 3 hours more due to the hold at NY. Not fun after the long overnight. But at least we had gate to gate IFE on the A321 we were on. The movie selection this time was a little different so managed to pass the time. Crew did water runs and handed out cookies while we were parked. They were friendly and very pleasant. We eventually got to LGA as expected 3 hours later with bags delivered very quickly. A long and very tiring trip from start to finish made much more pleasant thanks to the efficiency courtesy of some of Air Canada's staff and crew.,11th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,4,3,4,0,0,4,157
1567,Air Canada customer review,Cameron Singer,Not Verified,Flew on Sunday Dec 8 Toronto to London Seat 8 F departure 20.05. A worn out seat and the electrical recliner not optimal functioning that requires overhaul. Requested Salmon but sold out however they offered Cod which was not in the menu. Meal quality acceptable. Bread was just not the finest. Desert and Cheese was just poor. Fruit quality just poor quality selected.

1568,Air Canada customer review,Joel Hundert,Not Verified,"I found that the crew were courteous but busy. Service was rushed the seats too crowded and no video unless you knew enough to bring your iPad or rented one. We did not receive any notice that the flight that we originally booked from Toronto to Sarasota on Air Canada was switched to Rouge. It looks like Air Canada is down-grading its comfort items to compete with the low end ""vacation"" airlines.",10th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,2,3,1,0,0,3,157
1569,Air Canada customer review,P Gill,Not Verified,Frankfurt to Toronto. Positive: Customer service was efficient and courteous spacious clean and comfortable aircraft. Negatives: Horrible food - absolutely atrocious - We were served a hot meal shortly after departure and because the flight was booked they ran out of different meal options so by the time they served the back of the cabin not only was the food cold but we were not given any meal options. Apparently there was a chicken dish available but we were served a disgusting pasta Bolognese dish. The roll was stale and the side was some form of potatoes which had been reconstituted from potato flakes. Apparently others on the flight had similar issues with the chicken dish which tasted like rubber and a salad which had wilted. It was extremely disappointing and I did not eat any of it. Later on we were served Air Canada's 'signature' tortilla/wrap by Monty's which also tasted horrible and is worse than a pizza pocket. The meals and food in general were terrible and I pretty much went the entire flight without eating anything. I hope that Air Canada revamps their meals and offer healthier options instead of meals that look and taste worse than 'TV dinners' or those you would get from a can. I understand that many individuals have varying dietary requirements and allergies but perhaps Air Canada should invest in a dietician or nutritional consultant to encourage healthy eating on the go while meeting the needs of their customers.,6th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,4,1,4,0,0,3,157
1570,Air Canada customer review,B Allingham,Not Verified,We flew with Rouge from Toronto to Coast Rica Liberia. We upgraded our seats for more leg room it was still very uncomfortable.

Just arrived back and I am still so angry with the Canadian staff. Has not left a good impression. 1st flight was delayed which meant transit was a rush and rather than helping all the staff just shrugged their shoulders and rather than helping blamed us! We were sent in different directions and one even told us that we going the wrong way but they would not tell us where to go - just said or more shouted 'read the signs'.

1573,Air Canada customer review,S Klass,Not Verified,Newark-Toronto-Sao Paulo. I was impressed with how punctual Air Canada was on these two segments. In fact it was announced at EWR it would be likely we'd even leave early. Arrivals at both points right on time. Onboard cabin in the E190 felt much more comfortable than the 777-200 down to Sao Paulo. Cabin crew were efficient and polite on both sectors though not particularly warm on the longer overnight. Except for the Brazilian crew member who was all smiles and bubbly. Seat cushioning was a little hard and made it hard to sleep comfortably. Service quick meals average. Crew were present throughout the flight with water runs. I liked that there was On demand IFE even on the shorter segment but what isn't fun is how long it takes to fast forward the numerous ads to get to what you actually want to watch. Coupled with a slightly outdated interface and laggy response - you almost feel like not using the system at all after a while. However the selection was pretty good and varied. Time for an upgrade though - faster and higher res screens would be great.,3rd December 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,4,0,0,4,158
1574,Air Canada customer review,Jeremy Brown,Not Verified,I was flying Business Class from Ottawa to Montreal with an onward Business Class connection to Fort Lauderdale. For the first time I downloaded my boarding passes to my iPhone. I arrived at the 'bag drop' 45 minutes prior to departure. Admittedly at the point which Air Canada operate a 'cut off' of no more luggage. I had difficulty providing the electronic boarding pass so the extremely unhelpful 'attendant' pointed out my luggage could not be 'checked in'. No attempt to locate the booking at her desk no attempt to help me. 'Shameful on Air Canada' to employ unhelpful staff who seem to get pleasure from turning customers away. Reassuring for Air Canada and their shareholders that their staff have very little consideration for passengers especially those paying premium cabin fares.

1575,Air Canada customer review,Arul Muthukumarasamy,Not Verified,"Nov 30th YOW-YYZ. Nov 30th YYZ-SEA. Such a poor service at the check-in counter. They have a couple of staff helping folks to drop off their bags and 3 staff members checking-in passengers and 4 staff members checking-in priority passengers. The regular passenger line was the longest and they took about 15-20 mins to check-in each passenger with 2 check-in bags. I stood in line for 40 mins - I was nervous about missing the flight. I went to priority check-in staff and asked if he could help me as my flight was in 60 mins. He was hesitant but the staff member next to him said ""go back to your line"" in a rude tone. They should definitely learn to speed up their process better yet learn some manners along the way.

1576,Air Canada customer review,Keith Plezia,Not Verified,I am currently still at the airport. We were scheduled to fly to Calgary today at 8 am. We arrived at the airport 45 minutes prior to departure. We were told that the flight was closed and that we would have to be put on a later flight. They charged us an additional $150 per person to get on the later flight. That flight was delayed 3 times. We try to find an Air Canada employee several times in order to try to change our travel arrangements but no one was interested in speaking to us. No one was able to tell us why there was a delay. We did not know whether it was weather or equipment related. The level of customer service we experienced today is brutal. Any other for-profit business would be fail if they provided this level of customer service. I will never fly with Air Canada again.,29th November 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,0,0,2,158

After 1/2 hr got connected and agent said nothing can be done and that my son's rebooked for next day. They wouldn't rebook on any other airline w/o Air Canada flight numbers even though United and USAir are partners in the Star Alliance. What I'm most upset about is the no notification of cancellation - agent checked and said system shows ""text not sent"". He talked to supervisor and found out that the system attempted to send a text to my son at 2 pm when the flight was canceled but the text did not go through.

I was flying AC on Black Friday (when power failed on the eastern seaboard). Diverted into Montreal there were the BA and Air France staff marshalling their passengers to coaches to take them to their overnight hotels. Air Canada? When we eventually found someone all they shouted was ""get inventive on your cell phones people'.

The flight attendants could not have been more helpful and pleasant. My connection at Houston was tight. Unknown to me they arranged for me to move to the front of the plane so I could be one the first to get off. I was in a wheelchair. The airport worker in Houston dropped the ball and did not take me to my next gate as arranged. As a result I missed my connection and had to wait until the next day to get to Salt Lake City.

Flight from YGK-YYZ was a 1-1 configuration which was different and no drinks served but only a 50 minute flight and no flight attendant or cockpit door.

If you are tall impossible to fit in the seat pitch is the smallest 29 inches only. Being an Air Canada Super Elite members for more than 20 years we were quite disappointed that the usual Air Canada comfort was simply not there. We can accept to pay for food and alcoholic beverages but to be so squeezed that it is not acceptable. If you look to seat pitch offers by Air Canada rouge competitors this is the smallest one.

It took more than 2 hours for US Air staff and multiple misinformation for passengers (that we will all be re-booked on next flight that they did not have training on Air Canada systems and similar). In any case my spouse had similar issue on the flight from Toronto to PHL in June 2013. So this looks like a pattern.

They changed the timing of the plane without notice and when we got to the airport all they could tell us is that they sent us an email and if we didn't get it then it wasn't their problem. Manager was called to help us but after listening to our problem he told us that we could pay $75 per person if we want to go on an earlier flight.

1590,Air Canada customer review,N Nelson,Not Verified,First trip on Air Canada Rouge Cancun - Toronto October 26. Was interested to see how this new airline looks up close and was surprised at how awful the FA uniforms look in person. The colours are not flattering to any skin or hair colour the bowler hats are ridiculous and they just look downright cheap. The skinny hairbands don't help either. The FA's are very young and void of personality they have no senior co-workers to emulate and it shows. They look lost. They hardly spoke to the passengers and I heard one passenger comment as we left the aircraft that was the quietest flight crew they ever experienced. The aircraft is bare bones the bulkhead doesn't even go up to the ceiling so you are constantly looking into the galley. The seating is so tight a 29 inch pitch it should be illegal in the name of safety. Got off the flight and on to an Air Canada mainline flight to Vancouver. What a difference! The FA's may be older but they look experienced professional and confident and seem to be enjoying their jobs. I guess it's true you get what you pay for and Rouge is paying peanuts to these kids. The airfare was no bargain either so in future will avoid Rouge at all costs.,28th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,160
1591,Air Canada customer review,M Gordon,Not Verified,YVR-YYZ and YUL-YVR I had a great couple of flights and AC continue to improve their service. Breakfast in the Lounge was great in Vancouver as was lunch in the lounge in Montreal. The FA were a friendly crew and very attentive. In particular a woman serving us on our flight back to YVR was great. I appreciated the selection on the IFE and they made the 5 hour flight go by quickly. I fly AC regularly and the staff seem much happier these days. They even switched aircraft from a 320 to a 321 as they has so many passengers heading to Vancouver.,28th October 2013,,Business Class,,,4,5,5,5,0,0,5,160
1592,Air Canada customer review,J Busworth,Not Verified,YVR to SYD Jan 24 2013 Flight was delayed from 23.45 to 02.45 so forked out $50 for Maple leaf lounge which was utterly disappointing. The flight attendants were the best I've come across on a round the world trip. There was a good selection of inflight movies and airshow map was also good. Food was horrible and worse than some low cost carriers. The seat was comfortable and have good legroom. Would fly again.,28th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,5,2,3,0,0,4,160
1593,Air Canada customer review,S Luu,Not Verified,"Flew Vancouver to Toronto after doing a whirlwind trip which included flights on United Hawaiian and New Zealand Airlines as well and found Air Canada to be better than United but nowhere near as good as Hawaiian or New Zealand. Flight attendant was not helpful she wasn't rude but she wasn't any where near friendly. She would just stare at you until you said something then stare at the next flyer not even acknowledge she had heard correctly then started handing out drinks. A simple ""What would you like miss/sir?"" is all that is required but that was too much for her. Customer service is important to me and when it lacks it severely diminishes my views on the product quality of a company.",28th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,3,0,0,2,160
1594,Air Canada customer review,J Chang,Not Verified,Flew YVR-HKG return Executive First in September/October. Both flights were really comfortable with flat seats for sleeping. Services were also good on the plane and at check-ins but the food on the plane was really bad. The airport lounges served better food than on the plane! So feed yourself in the lounges before boarding!,28th October 2013,,Business Class,,,5,4,1,2,0,0,3,160
1595,Air Canada customer review,M LaPrairie,Not Verified,AC002 NRT-YYZ. Dated cabin. Rushed service. Indifferent attitude. What can I say? Who needs flight attendants in J class telling you that you cannot have your meal a bit later after the regular service? A crew member in my aisle said no dinner is now. After I politely said that I'd rather eat a bit later (13 hour flight) she replied ok you can wait but it might be cold. She then proceeds to unfold my tray when I am away from my seat. Unfortunately she didn't put my tray completely flat being in such a big rush to keep to her schedule and not wanting to disturb her routine”so on the first use of my knife my entire tray goes flying sending food into the guy across the aisle from me. There I am on the floor picking up bits of food and apologizing to my neighbor. Not good. Honestly when you book a couple days before departure and your ticket (one way) costs US$6200 you can eat when you want. Old outdated audio/visual. Main meal looked like the dogs breakfast. Never again.,28th October 2013,,Business Class,,,4,2,2,4,0,0,2,160
1596,Air Canada customer review,Kathleen Douglas,Not Verified,Long distance flight to London the TV did not work nor did the reading lights in our section of the plane so we sat for 9 hours in the dark. On the way home we were offered salmon or beef meals but the salmon ran out almost immediately nd the plug on the armrest for sound on the TV was blocked. We were offered 5% off our next Air Canada flight in the next year as compensation. The overall impression is they just don't care.,28th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,1,0,0,1,160
1597,Air Canada customer review,M Baya,Not Verified,"Flew to Calgary on Oct 11 with a connecting flight through Vancouver with no major glaring problems. Flights were on time even a bit early. I usually fly with WestJet so I'm used to friendly flight attendants. Boarding this flight was quite a shock. The flight attendant at the front of the plane had a scowl on her face and didn't reply when I greeted her. Later during the in-flight service the same flight attendant asked me if I wanted pretzels. I said ""no no pretzels thank you"" and she didn't offer me a drink at all. I had to her co-worker for a drink and she looked annoyed that I asked. Cleanliness of the cabin was so-so. The floors were clear and there was no garbage in my seat pocket but the window I was sitting next to was coated in what I assume to be facial grease. Delicious. I'm currently preparing for my flights tomorrow and they have both been cancelled and delayed and now I have a layover in Vancouver for several hours. Even though Air Canada is offering other flights to my destination at an earlier time with several available seats they refused to change my flights. I booked my flights a day early to avoid missing mandatory engagements at my final destination due to many of my friends flying with Air Canada and sharing their horror stories about the service and cancellations/delays. I think its sad that a supposedly professional business can operate in such a manner. Air Canada needs to take lessons from WestJet or CMA on how to manage their passengers and timing schedule if they want my business again.",25th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,2,0,0,3,160
1598,Air Canada customer review,R Poole,Not Verified,YYT-LHR 11 Oct 2013 and LHR-YYT 21 Oct 2013. Both segments were on-time and overall great experiences. My only complaint with AC is the lack of legroom in economy (I'm 6'2) but I've come to expect this. The IFE is top-notch staff service was great and overall a very professional service. It was fun to cross the Atlantic in an A319.,23rd October 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,5,5,5,0,0,5,160
1599,Air Canada customer review,H Hoskin,Not Verified,Toronto to Varadero. If you are tall 5 ft 10 and over and a little fluffy you will not fit in the seats. I am short 5 ft 4 and not fluffy and I was cramped the seat in front of me felt like it was only 12 inches away from my face. I can not even think of booking Air Canada rouge for my family to fly anywhere as my hubby and son are over 6 feet tall. If you want food entertainment Wifi or a beer all cost and payable with Credit card. My return flight was an hour and half late with no explanation I had a customs form that needed to be filled out and since we left at 11.45 at night it would of been nice to get that form at the start of the flight not at the end of flight when I was woken up and not had my brain intact. The darn seats are cramped for me to purchase again on Air Canada Rouge it would have to be a flight of last resort. Never again.,23rd October 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,3,1,1,0,0,4,160
1600,Air Canada customer review,D Riddell,Not Verified,"Travelled from Vancouver to Asia and back. Transited through Tokyo. In Vancouver the boarding announcements were made in Japanese first followed by Canada's 2 official languages. When I asked at the check in counter they said that the official languages should come first but maybe today was different. Sat in one of the premium seats an exit row seat for more leg room. At 6'3"" and 220 lbs I need it. Headphones did not work so pushed button for attendant. Waited a long time and pushed again. The steward showed up and said ""You need something"" not in a pleasant way but kind of annoyed. Mentioned the problem. He got me another set of headphones they did not work either. His response was to move to another seat and started to walk away as I reminded him that you pay extra for premium seats - he did not care. Service was not good. On the way back the service was better.",22nd October 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,2,3,3,0,0,3,161
1601,Air Canada customer review,N Raven,Not Verified,YVR-LAX mid-day on an Embraer 190. Everything about this flight was smooth and efficient. The plane itself is worthy of comment: smooth powerful yet quiet. The newish light-construction seats were very night and afforded me a lot more foot room. Air Canada's inflight entertainment is the best I have encountered. The service staff were young and correct. The only part of this AC experience that was poor as it has been on other trips is the check-in procedure. It was chaotic with most passengers not certain which queue to join (Check-in Bag Drop Ticketing Self-Check-in) even after they checked themselves in. AC needs to fix this. The fix is easy: have one person out front directing passengers.,22nd October 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,5,0,0,4,161
1602,Air Canada customer review,W Foster,Not Verified,"Air Canada Rouge if this is the future for Air Canada someone else better step up to be Canada's national carrier. The only thing about it that is interesting is the paint job. It was the maiden trip to Cancun and I was actually excited to see what all the promotion was. That died off when I tried to sit in my seat. I figure a man at 5' 11"" should be fairly average and thus should be able to fit comfortably. WRONG. The seats are crammed in there there are no electronics in the seats whatsoever so bring a book or be ready to dish out money for old movies or sitcoms. The staff are friendly and polite but some of the 'hip' ways of communicating just don't fit the world of flying. I'm in a plane in the air far above the ocean I want to feel just a touch more professionalism. Air Canada only changed what they had to look at any part of the plane with a touch of detail and you'll see that it's just a gutted plane with very basic changes. The worst part is that by the looks of it Rouge is set to take over more and destinations come 2014. Guess I'll have to drive to Pearson airport so I can fly with anyone else vs using a connector with Air Canada. Sorry but not impressed.",20th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,3,2,1,0,0,2,161
1603,Air Canada customer review,T Lau,Not Verified,AC9076 Sep 28 2013. I had a business class ticket from Amsterdam to Toronto hub through Frankfurt. This leg of the flight is operated by Air Canada's Star Alliance Partner Lufthansa. Apparently for flights within the EU there is no differentiation between business class versus economy because when boarding time came this was an absolute 'zoo'. No pre-boarding announcement for business class ticket holders and no priority boarding. So my conclusion is that if you're flying within the EU at least on Star Alliance flights they'll take your money for business class but treat you just like 'cattle class'. Shame on me for expecting something different.,20th October 2013,,Business Class,,,2,3,2,2,0,0,1,161

1605,Air Canada customer review,P Roberts,Not Verified,"October 14 2013 took flight 847 on 777-300 from Munich to Toronto and then flight 787 from Toronto to Los Angeles later that day. Flight 847 was on a new ""High density"" 777-300 with 10 abreast seats resulting in narrow seats and reduced pitch to 31"". I am 5'10"" tall and 170 lbs and the height that aircraft seats were originally made for. It was impossible to reach down and get things from the floor without getting up and bending over. The price of this flight was not cheaper than others and Air Canada did a bait and switch changing the configuration after I purchased the ticket. The cabin crew did their best . The galley for the 400 seats in economy was very small. The food was almost non-existent. Air Canada has the worst food for an international flight I have had. The second meal was a heated wrap essentially a ""hot pocket"". Inflight entertainment was new system on this plane and was quite good but the second flight had a slow outdated system. Overall service good and AVOD good everything else terrible. Flight 787 was an Airbus A320. Bad AVOD only two bathrooms for economy. Turbulent flight so when not turbulent long lines for lavs. Service Satisfactory everything else not. Hopefully Air Canada will get new 737 MAX equipment with 3 lavs in the rear for these medium haul flights. The Pearson Airport transition with US customs is terrible. Would be better just to have customs in final destination. Canada is not the USA so what benefit is it for the consumer to spend 2 hours of their layover in customs rather than eating and relaxing after Air Canada's horrifying service.",15th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,3,1,3,0,0,1,161
1606,Air Canada customer review,S Alex,Not Verified,Air Canada Rouge - Great cabin crew terrible seating space. I flew from Toronto Canada to Varadero Cuba and back. In both directions the cabin crew were excellent and that is where all good about Rouge stops because no matter what these great people do they can not solve issue with lack of space between the seats. Airplane type was A319 and they had 31 raw of seats which basically means no leg room at all. Anyone close or above to 6 feet or 180cm should avoid Rouge flights. Seating pitch on this plane is 29 and this is for flights to Caribbean. After 3.5 hours of flight you will not be able to get out from your seat because of pain in your back and legs. It is so tight between the seats that in my view this is security issue since in case of the emergency people will have extreme difficulties to quickly leave the seat. When it comes to entertainment system there is something called wifi and that has to be paid 10 $ but it did not work so I can say is it worth or not other than this there is no other option. When it comes to food and drinks non alcoholic beverages including coffee and tea are free how ever quantity is limited to one or if you are lucky two drinks at the best. Food and liqueurs can be purchased but for that you will need credit card as cash is not accepted.,13th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,5,2,1,0,0,1,161

1609,Air Canada customer review,M Randall,Not Verified,October 5 2013 LGA to YYZ. We booked our flights over 3 months ago my husband 8 year old daughter and me. When we arrived at LGA to check in 3 hours before our flight the AC counter representative forced us to check in at the kiosk even though there was nobody in line at the counter! I usually do the kiosk thing but given we had a lot of luggage our child has a broken arm in a cast and we were tired I just wanted to deal with a live person. She refused to check us in at the counter and instead assisted us at the kiosk. She then told us we couldn't have seats together as the plane was full. Not an ideal scenario travelling with an 8 year old child! She said there was nothing she could do. She scolded me for not having checked in online 24 hours prior. I explained to her that was impossible as we were in the middle of the ocean on a cruise and she said oh well and shrugged. What fantastic customer service!

1611,Air Canada customer review,R Wiegmann,Not Verified,Flew in Business Class from FRA via YYz to BNA. A/C from FRA was a 777 already before take off the crew advised that the IFE was not working. They tried a couple of times to re-start it and finally 2 hours before arrival it got done. Things like that happen but no apologies or compensation was offered for a 6000 USD flight. Food was average to low and the crew was rushing through the service with no smile. Bottle of white wine was clearly open for a while the glass was taken away and after my comment about the bad taste no more wine was offered nice way of solving that problem. Transfer in YYZ was easy and good and shortly after boarding the CRJ for Nashville the plane was grounded for technical issues. Had to run to the other end of the airport to get a spare plane 2 hours later and had to wait in a small waiting room with no water or communication on what was going on. AC needs to realise that there is a choice in air travel and that sometimes a smile can make a big difference.,9th October 2013,,Business Class,,,3,1,1,1,0,0,2,162
1612,Air Canada customer review,Melissa Chow,Not Verified,I flew Air Canada a couple of times recently to Vancouver. It was a very enjoyable experience. The staff are very efficient at their work. In serving the meals they are very quick to serve as they have 4 people serving two for the meals and two later for the drinks. After the meal is done we didn't have to wait for long before they came to pick up the trays. I would take Air Canada for long haul flights.

1613,Air Canada customer review,J Thompson,Not Verified,I fly to Greece twice a year and book on a regular flight going through Frankfurt. But in August of this year had the chance to try Air Canada rouge. I paid the same price as a normal flight and got far less than usual. 1) Plane was old and cold. 2) There was no air control system above the seat. 3) Staff were less than friendly. 4) Cold food tea and coffee. 5) Poor entertainment. 6) I had to interrupt a steward using his phone to ask him to put more toilet paper in the bathrooms. 7) I asked for an extra dinner roll as the pasta was terrible I was told they did not know if they had enough to go around even though the flight was not full I never got the dinner roll. 8) The plane was not very clean. 9) Although I paid the same price as a regular flight I still had to pay for wine. I will never fly AC rouge again. My flight home from Athens was a regular flight and I almost felt guilty with the attention I received. The staff are more mature and know how to communicate with customers. They go out of their way to be available at all times. Their presence is comforting. I will continue flying AC but only on regular flights even if it takes a little longer to get to my destination. By offering AC rouge you have only embarrassed yourself but have taken a few steps backwards in customer service.,6th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,162

1616,Air Canada customer review,Pascale Moreau,Not Verified,AC793 Rome-MTL Sep 15th. For the last 12-24 months our many experiences with Air Canada have been nothing but disappointing and far from a world class transporter standard. Both my husband and I are frequent flyers ( I personally take an average of 20 flights a year with Air Canada in North America or Overseas). I don't think it is normal that I have to clean the cabin (remove the cookie crumbs food) off my seat which is filthy stained clean the walls covered with spills and put my blanket on the seat to avoid having to change my clothing when I am heading off to a meeting. Those are things I had to do on my flight from Rome (and the same from Geneva London Paris) The last flight from Rome. The audio system was not working my tablet was broken and the overhead light of our entire row inoperative. We had paid for Business tickets and were standby so I paid an extra for preferred seat so I could have room for my injured knee the leg room was fine but I can tell you that the experience wherever you sit Economy or Business it is always the same: prepare a few napkins and sanitizer so I can have a decent place to sit before the flight.

I now know this was disclosed on their web site but this was not disclosed at the time I purchased our tickets. The food was awful. The ""hot snack"" consisted of a dry wrap in a box which was horrible. There was a large box under the seat in front of me (any many other seats). This meant I had very little leg room and for such a long trip it was very uncomfortable. The washrooms were dirty and there weren't enough of them.

1621,Air Canada customer review,M Steve,Not Verified,YYZ-KIN-YYZ. Flew Air Canada's discount division Rouge to Kingston. Flight was packed on the outbound and boarding was chaotic due to passengers returning with copious purchases and multiple suitcases and carry-ons. Flight attendants are all new hires and so lack most of the basic skills expected of them. I purchased an extra leg room seat in one of the first four rows. Be aware that KIN check in agents will fill these seats with mothers and babies if you think you're getting a bit of respite. For purchase food selection was missing the healthy items inbound and outbound. Return flight was delayed 45 minutes when customer traveling with parent and 7 relatives including 3 newborns had not made proper arrangements for oxygen and crew struggled to deploy the onboard oxygen using FA manuals to sort out the issues. Lost connection meant 3 hour wait and midnight arrival in YOW. Rouge is not Westjet. Comments from customer below about her YUL to Athens flight neglected to mention that it too was a Rouge flight.,29th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,1,0,0,4,163
1622,Air Canada customer review,R Mortara,Not Verified,YVR-LHR. I decided to return to the UK direct rather than via Europe. Plus points: flight left on time and arrived early even with a short hold before landing. Also Air Canada has a 3x3x3 configuration on its 777-300s rather than the 3x4x3 used by many other airlines. Leg room is ok but I found the seat was getting uncomfortable after a few hours. Other aspects left me wondering how this airline is classed as a 4 star airline. Check-in was quick but with no smiles. Even one of the staff at the gate was almost rude about the darkened spectacles I have to wear. On board one of the cabin attendants shrugged her shoulders when I asked for a blanket their was only a pillow on my seat and she was chewing gum whilst handing out breakfast. At least I did get a blanket after asking one of the other crew members. No hot or cold towels only one drink at a time show how this airline skimps on the things others provide as a norm. The food is poor as well. My special meal was provided but it was tasteless. 'Continental breakfast' comprised a small muffin and a small container of fruit - insufficient for a flight of 9 hours duration. The AVOD was ok with a wide choice available. I may well go to Canada again but will avoid Air Canada.,25th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,2,0,0,3,163
1623,Air Canada customer review,Philip Rubenstein,Not Verified,YYZ-NRT-YVR using B777 / A330 in Executive First. Trip started off nice enough but ended in a cancellation and a forced delay of 1 day. I flew off peak hours so I benefited from a quick check-in with a personable agent. The YYZ-NRT boarding was the usual rush of pax. It would be nice if AC moved the priority lane to one side and it was better labelled so people don't accuse priority boarders of pushing in the line. Not a full flight so FAs had an opportunity to take their time and provide decent service. Food and beverages better than usual and overall I have noticed AC has shown some improvement in its food quality in the past year. Unfortunately the wine selection is still hit and miss. The seat showed its age and was well used. The IFE selection was boring and I resent the forced commercials. It was a good flight and I was able to catch a few hours of sleep. The problem was with the return flight. It was cancelled due to equipment issues. It happens but it seems to be an increasing scenario at AC. The AC response to the issue was disorganized and slow. Personnel tried their best. The end result was hours wasted at the airport until AC sent Pax off to a hotel. Communication was poor. The concierge in NRT was professional although it took some time to get an answer. The lady in YVR who assisted was also professional and kind. Unfortunately the replacement flight the next day was also beset by equipment issues as the air conditioning system wasn't working well and the cabin was stuffy and hot for the flight to YVR. However FAs on this flight were the best I have had on AC. I seem to be encountering an increasing number of equipment issues and delays with AC. I have only recently started using the airline again on my long hauls and I am not particularly impressed by this aspect of its operations.,25th September 2013,,Business Class,,,3,5,3,3,0,0,3,163
1624,Air Canada customer review,Donald Carmichael,Not Verified,I rarely take this airline and on September 12 2013 from LGA to YOW I know why I avoid this carrier whenever possibly. Stupid decisions in difficult (weather) situations are not usually typical of A 4 star airline. I travel weekly in North America and I would rate several domestic carriers far superior.

1626,Air Canada customer review,Johnny West,Not Verified,NRT-YYZ on Sep 16. There was a supposedly a typhoon in Tokyo so flight was delayed 2 hours. I think the food is getting worse since my last flight! One of the offerings was a mini sandwich with simply cucumber and mayonnaise. The apples for breakfast did not look fresh. They were brown already so it was not appetizing! Air Canada's IFE is good lots of good movies to choose from! Cabin crew is where Air Canada really need to improve on their international flights! Although at least 70% of the crew were very pleasant there are some of the older ladies who just seemed like they were above it all. One hostess was emotionless when distributing food she just put it straight on our table and left.,18th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,4,0,0,4,163
1627,Air Canada customer review,A Agustin,Not Verified,AC Jazz and Express from YTZ-YQB via YUL was a breeze in spite of heavy fog and two cancellations the ground staff at Billy Bishop Airport was very helpful and respectful to passengers. AC Jazz from YQB to YYZ was smooth and the flight attendants were great. It was a smooth and pleasant flight back to Toronto.,16th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,4,0,0,4,163
1628,Air Canada customer review,Marc Keller,Not Verified,Took Air Canada on our flights from Zurich via Toronto to Mexico City and return all business/first: On long haul flights over the Atlantic (both ways). Entertainment system broke down regularly on both Atlantic flights (several restarts necessary for the whole cabin). No coffee or tea on overnight flight for breakfast (customers were very happy about that). Headsets are fixed to infrastructure - cable in my face. Both toilets in business class with no water for handwash after 2 hour flight. Seats and surrounding not very clean. Meals: just the absolute necessity but not an inch more! Compared to Swiss Emirates Singapore or Lufthansa business class: not worth the money and real hygiene problems!,15th September 2013,,Business Class,,,2,2,2,1,0,0,2,163
1629,Air Canada customer review,Vlad Alexeyenko,Not Verified,Latest flight YVR-YYZ. Flight was overbooked (as usual) therefore it took awhile before I got my seat. No food despite the fact it is a 4.5 hour flight. Airplane was old seats were not leather. No complaints about the crew. TV screen in the seat in front so that was good. Ticket price - $335 OW if purchased RT - no discount. Barely any legroom.,15th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,5,1,5,0,0,3,163
1630,Air Canada customer review,J Samuels,Not Verified,San Francisco-Vancouver-Tokyo-Calgary-San Francisco 8/25/13-9/7/13. Absolutely terrible experience with this airline. The agent in San Francisco was extremely rude and unfriendly to all the passengers she served including us. The flight attendants particularly on the return flight from Tokyo were also rude to passengers to the point of eye-rolling with polite requests for drinks. I fly often and have not experienced this degree of rude service both on the ground and in the air in many years.,15th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,4,0,0,1,164
1631,Air Canada customer review,R Gamba,Not Verified,Flight from YYC to IAH in Executive Class was just OK. Food was horrible but the flight service director did his job well. Flight from CUN to YYC in Executive Class was one of the best flights I've been on. The food on this segment was much better but what made is so great was the cheerfulness and helpfulness of the flight service director. Drinks were always topped up and staff made sure everyone was comfortable and asked if there was anything else they needed even though it was a full flight. A pleasant surprise from Air Canada.,12th September 2013,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,164
1632,Air Canada customer review,Kaye Neicho,Not Verified,Had a very good experience flying from London Heathrow to Toronto via Chicago on 23/8/13. Everything from booking the flight customer service before flight and during flight checking in boarding aircraft comfort on board good connecting service and the same on direct return flight everything was great. Competitive price as well.,11th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,4,0,0,4,164
1633,Air Canada customer review,N Sabir,Not Verified,I fly regularly on the Boston to Toronto route and Air Canada always disappoints. On my most recent trip I tried to check my bag in at the gate which I have done many times before) because I didn't want to have to lift my bag into the overhead bin on the plane as I am 7 months pregnant. I was told not to do that since the bag was small and there was plenty of space on the plane and someone would help me. When I got on the plane and asked the steward if he could help me put my bag up in the overhead bin he took a look at my bag and asked 'Is it really that heavy?'. He told me a passenger would help me! Just downright rude. They always seem to set the bar for the worst customer experience whether it has been when I have missed a flight or their policies with respect to gate checking strollers and car seats. They are by far the worst airline to travel with children.,11th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,1,0,0,3,164
1634,Air Canada customer review,Catharine Kalafatis,Not Verified,Terrible flight to and from Greece. Freezing cabin and rude stewardesses. Food worst I have tasted. Seats very uncomfortable asked for blankets and was asked if I was sick? We had exit rows and they would not turn down the air conditioning. The entire plane was freezing. Then when we arrived in Montreal to connect to Toronto they said the flights were cancelled and they would have to see what they could do the next day. My son had taken another flight and was left waiting at the airport in Toronto for us. They were not willing to help or guide and people were scrambling to try to get out on a flight that evening to Toronto. Every year we say never again this experience was the last straw.,11th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,164
1635,Air Canada customer review,Stephen Brunette,Not Verified,ADB-IST-YYZ-YUL return in economy on 14 August. First flight on Turkish from Izmir code share. Even though a code share flight they couldn't give me my AC boarding passes and told me my luggage would go through to Montreal but I had to check in at AC in Istanbul. Too many people scheduled to be an A320 switched to a A340 at last minute leading to delays leaving Izmir. Arrived in Istanbul we were taken to a remote stand and finally bussed to the domestic terminal. Dashed to the international terminal reps for AC were waiting all smiles and no problems got my two remaining boarding passes. Massive line at immigration control to leave. I went to the front and asked some people if they would let me go ahead as my flight had already started to board. Just made it to my flight to Toronto. Once on board a perfect as a flight in economy could be. Excellent flight attendants professional and friendly. Drinks then a wonderful meal of lamb. Plenty of water runs snack part way through self service drinks and snacks in galley. Another meal 1.5 hrs before landing chicken again excellent. B767 had been refurbished excellent seats comfortable and entertainment system first rate with plenty of choices. Bags didn't make it to YYZ Turkish Airlines fault but AC was very good about getting them to me in Ottawa to my hotel 2 days later. Transfer to YUL smooth good short flight. Return flights again on AC from YUL-YYZ-IST on 23 Aug very good great service by caring crew as outbound. Equipment change again in IST to ADB on THY code share seat changed. Flight short and ok. Overall Air Canada has a great product as I have flown this route over the last 10 years using Turkish Airlines Air France KLM and Lufthansa. The price I paid was cheaper then the rest the flight attendants are what made the difference so nice and accommodating as well as good food for economy. I will keep using AC now that they are flight to IST from Canada.,10th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,164
1636,Air Canada customer review,O Perera,Not Verified,Flew from Toronto to Sydney on 7th September. Flight left Toronto at 8.25pm. We were in transit in Vancouver which was 4.5 hrs flying. What we were offered for dinner when we boarded in Toronto was a snack which had to be paid. Then when we arrived in Vancouver all our cabin luggage had to be taken with us and reboard the same plane to the same seats. This was really inconvenient from the passengers point of view. By the time we were served a proper meal was 2.30am Toronto time. Toronto to Sydney just the flying time was 20 hrs. That kind of a meal service for such a long flight is not acceptable.,10th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,3,0,0,3,164
1637,Air Canada customer review,M Gordon,Not Verified,YVR-YOW-YVR. Breakfast flight to Ottawa on an Airbus 320. I had breakfast in the AC lounge and it was good the wireless needs to be upgraded as it was very slow and the YVR wireless was much faster. Our FA on the flight was very attentive and the breakfast service was excellent. Delayed 45 minutes landing in Ottawa due to a thunderstorm. On my return journey I enjoyed my stay in the lounge with good food and a glass of quality wine but again the wireless was slow and I gave up using it. The return flight was an Airbus 319. There was only one FA with us in the front cabin and she did the best she could being short handed with a full cabin. She was friendly and otherwise I enjoyed my trip. The meal was excellent and she offered a special liqueur service which was appreciated by many in the front cabin. My other suggestion is that on the IFE you get more documentaries old comedy TV shows and classic films. These must be reasonably inexpensive. Because I travel so much with them I sometimes run out of choices. However for both I paid an executive class fare and I got good value for what I paid.,9th September 2013,,Business Class,,,5,4,5,4,0,0,5,164
1638,Air Canada customer review,Jane Coney,Not Verified,19th Aug London to Toronto. Flight was fine though staff seemed too few and too busy to deal with passengers. The next leg 5 days later we checked in for online Toronto to Los Angeles we were asked to pay for our cases to check in $75 not expected. The flight though was very poor. Our return trip on the 2 Sep from LA to Toronto was just as bad but the Toronto to London was the worst. Too many people getting on with oversized bags and being allowed too plane was very over crowded. also our inflight entertainment wasn't working in any of our 3 seats the staff just shrugged their shoulders and handed out contact details for customer service. The plane was old and dirty we will not be using Air Canada again.,9th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,0,0,2,164
1639,Air Canada customer review,F Hryn,Not Verified,YXE-YYZ-DUB-CPH CPH-YYZ-YXE in economy. Paid an excellent price for this route. Flight to Toronto uneventful good service flights on time. Air Canada is my first choice for transatlantic flying but after 2 flights in my itinerary I will definitely reconsider especially the one to Dublin. It's not that the flight was uncomfortable the entire experience was just average. Flight attendants seemed uninterested and the plane was probably the oldest in the fleet. The arm rest of my seat had something that looked like industrial-strength foil holding parts together. I think this flight is over-looked since it is a seasonal route. This route is also being transferred to Rouge next year so maybe it'll improve. CPH-YYZ absolutely no problem newer aircraft friendly flight crew. Boarding at CPH was somewhat interesting - over 200 people left to sit in the hallway and departure lounge only opened shortly before boarding. YYZ-YXE late leaving YYZ due to an issue with the cargo door. No problem - safety first. Next time: Lufthansa!,8th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,3,4,3,0,0,5,164
1640,Air Canada customer review,Em Vittorio,Not Verified,I flew YYZ-WAW with a stop in FRA. The YYZ-FRA portion was operated by an AC 777-300 aircraft. This was on July 23 2013. I was happy with the service I received. I did on-line check-in and printed my boarding pass prior to arriving at the airport. To print my baggage tags I went to the check-in kiosk but the kiosk unfortunately did not want to print out all my tags meaning I could not go to the quick express bag-drop queue. This wasn't really a problem though because as a Star Alliance Gold customer I can use the quick Executive Class check-in queue to drop off my baggage. Check-in agent Heather was very nice and friendly! She actually gave me individual attention to the fact that my baggage should be labelled as fragile. I then went past security and with a friend I went to the Maple Leaf / Star Alliance Gold lounge. Lounge had a calming and not too busy atmosphere very pleasant and recommended! The flight itself was great! Cabin crew were attentive (although not the very friendliest AC cabin crew I have encountered but still very good) and the in-flight entertainment options were actually I think the best part of the flight. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal came quickly and in general it was a good flight!,8th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,5,0,0,5,165
1641,Air Canada customer review,N McCrohan,Not Verified,AC 895 Dublin Ireland to Toronto. Good check in staff. Flight on time. Booked Air Canada ahead of other airlines. Expected good service as the National Carrier but was very disappointed. Food not up to much and cabin crew did not make much of an effort. They seemed quite bored. Return flight AC894 Fast check in and very courteous. Flight was awful due to weather conditions. Food very boring and small portions. Breakfast was a slice of banana bread and juice / tea / coffee. Planes are very old on this route. Air Canda will have to up their game next year when Aer Lingus start operating! Certainly no value for money.,5th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,2,0,0,1,165
1642,Air Canada customer review,Carole Ruxton,Not Verified,Flight on 22nd August 2013 Dublin to Toronto and return on 30th August. Cabin crew very grumpy. Food okay on outward journey. Films okay. Interior of cabin grubby. Wasn't expecting that from AC. Return journey encountered bad weather food service was delayed a considerable time due to safety issues so when it finally arrived it was hardly palatable. I noticed a lot of unfinished meals going back. Banana bread for breakfast hardly constitutes a meal. Toilets were very grubby and towel bin held closed with masking tape which eventually fell down. I will not rush out to fly with AC. I will fly Aer Lingus next time.,5th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,2,1,3,0,0,2,165
1643,Air Canada customer review,S Paice,Not Verified,LHR-Toronto-LHR. Day flight from Heathrow wasn't too bad. Check-in painless lounge ok although the time from 'go to gate' to 'closing' in departures is ridiculously short. Inflight meal was ok - child's meal was well received adult's meal perfectly ok and served promptly with additional drinks available on request. Only downside was the bassinet wasn't available. IFE ok when it worked although it needed re-booted at least 3 times. Return flight. Check in at Toronto an utter shambles check in online but to get to bag drop you need to print out all your bag tags. This would be fine but their system can't cope with a booking including an infant. Thankfully the desk agent took pity on us and printed them out. Toronto lounge pleasant. Inflight pretty terrible. AC seem to persist with ancient aircraft without winglets so turbulence is amplified meaning the seat belt light on most of the trip. No food service during 'turbulence' so meal service took hours and the lights were left on so neither of the children (or us) slept at all. Asked for lights to be dimmed and 'we can't dim them' was the reply. Didn't get a drink before food due to the apparent turbulence cutting short the drink run and the never came back until 'breakfast'. At least I got dinner eventually unlike the poor folk at the back who waited at least 3 hours. 'Breakfast' was a slice of banana bread and the kids got a bran muffin. Asked for a diet coke to try and wash it down got 2 fingers worth and some ice. Pointless and not at all filling. AC would have been better with a light snack for dinner (given we took off at 10pm) and a decent breakfast. Some of the staff were quite friendly and chatty but it couldn't describe a truly miserable flight. I could only really describe it as 'United in disguise' expected far better from AC. Luggage showed up though and we arrived in once piece and on time so a couple of marks gained there.,4th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,2,0,0,2,165
