24 hour delay which was not acceptable,Tony Harris,TripVerified,"  Flight from Sydney to Montreal cancelled on 05 February, automatically rebooked on the next day flight. A 24 hour delay which was not acceptable to me - only seat available on the 06 February flight from Sydney to Toronto and then Vancouver and Smithers was business class when I went online to book .. so I paid $3,900 for a flight which is normally less than a $1,000 eco and $2,000 business but I needed to be in Smithers on 06 February. I arrived in Toronto 15 min late with a 45 min connection I received a text message saying I had been rebooked to the 15:20 flight meaning I then had an 18 hour stopover in Vancouver and arrived in Smithers on 07 February. I go to the gate of my original flight and people still boarding .. they say I have been rebooked as my baggage would not make it and nothing they could do I needed to go back to the service desk - on the way back to the service desk I get a text message saying my original flight was going to be leaving 20 min late, so back to the original 45 min on which the ticket was sold - service desks gets me a seat on the 9am from Toronto to Vancouver in economy as no business seats.

Worst airline ever,S Deane,TripVerified,"  Air Canada’s website booked me with another airline’s flight to connect to their airline’s flight. The flight prior to my Air Canada flight was canceled for holiday, so I got into contact with that airline and they said since I booked through Air Canada, they would not be able to resolve the issue. I talked to Air Canada (via messenger because no one answered the phone) and was told it was the responsibility of the other airline to get me to my final destination, even though I was booked through Air Canada.

the staff had no power to act,Collins Mazraani,TripVerified,"  I had booked business class for my mother and for me I had booked economy. I wanted to upgrade my reservation for business. With the covid it was necessary to pass a test before leaving 48 hours before departure. While the possibility of raising the category of the seat was open up to 48 hours before departure. So I had the trouble of doing this upgrade, because the possibility was closed on the website, at the airport in Beirut, with my agency in Montreal, etc. I arrive on the gate at London airport after a stopover. they tell me that now it's too late to do the enhancement. The seats in the business section were almost empty and the staff had no power to act, all they tell you is company policy. I asked to pay for the upgrade, or to accommodate myself with an upgrade because my mother is an elderly person and she does not speak the language. They said they will take good care of my mother, something they did well but my mother did not feel comfortable because of the language barrier and they did not want to disturb the business section while during the 7.5 hour flight I was able to go see my mother 4 times only for 1 min only, so as not to disturb. I find that Air Canada does not give any power to act to its employees and it should have put a travel manager who listens to passengers and that we have the tools so that they can do the impossible to satisfy its clientele.  J'avais réservé business class pour ma mère et pour moi j'avais réservé économie. je voulais rehaussé ma réservation pour business. Avec le covid il fallait passé un test avant de partir 48 heure avant le départ. Alors que la possibilité de rehaussé la catégorie du siège était ouvert jusqu'à 48 heure avant le départ. Alors j'ai eu la misère de faire ce rehaussement, car la possibilité était fermé sur le site web, à l'aéroport de beirut, avec mon agence de Montréal etc. j'arrive sur le gate à l'aéroport de londre après un escale. ils me disent que maintenant c'est trop tard de faire le rehaussement.

Absolutely the worst airline,Shawn Holden,NotVerified," Houston to Prince George. They cancelled my flight from Houston to Prince George over 5 times (I lost count) due to Covid and gave me a travel credit that was emailed back to me. I have tried to redeem the credit. I have called 5 times to ""customer service"", I use that term with hesitation, hung up on 4 times, put back on hold because the travel credit code that they emailed me does not match any records. 45 minutes later, they tell me my flight credits are about to expire and are under another credit code and I have to change those flight credits into a flight voucher but that will take 2 months to get my travel voucher. How does a company in 2022 take 2 Months to give you your flight credits that you paid for? I can return something on my Chase Credit Card and get instant credit but it takes 2 months to transfer credit internally at Air Canada. (The only think I can figure is that this is a technique that the Air Canada uses to take your flight credit or make you wait until the ticket prices go up and charge you more money.)

the corners they cut in customer service on the plane is ludicrous,H Maresh,TripVerified," The seats were comfy, the staff were nice, the airplane of decent quality, the entertainment system was brilliant and so on.

Its a 4 hour journey, how about some chips or crackers?  Want to experience their brilliant entertainment system? Better purchase some headphones at a ridiculous price. Its rather ridiculous when you consider Air Canada maintains prices that are 3 times higher than cheap budget airlines with Flair. - you get marginally better customer service off the plane, and a carry-on, but not much else.

practically a monopoly,S Jenson,TripVerified," Montreal to Los Angeles. Air Canada always go the extra mile to make your life miserable as a passenger.

Of course, I never seen any mentions of that before and no other airline do this kind of thing. I could see their lounge is mostly empty. They absolutely don't care about the passengers.

Frustrating to say the least,D Fry,TripVerified,"  Frustrating to say the least, I had to pack my patience. Went to visit my in-laws for the holiday as they are getting older and my mother-in-law really wanted us to visit. My husband and I got the the family together to travel we flew out of Orlando on Christmas day which was reasonable enough I give a pass to the attitude of the staff because it is Christmas day but the horrible part is returning home. We got all of our COVID test done on New Years Eve as we were traveling on New Year's Day, got to the airport in plenty of time(t3 hours ahead) and the incompetence was just mind boggling but we got through and told our bags would be checked all the way through to Orlando as we would pre-clear customs in Montreal and then head to Orlando. Well this is where it went batshit crazy. Our flight out of Vancouver was delayed by an hour we got into Montreal and Air Canada lost one of our bags so we were held up in US immigration because we couldn't clear customs without that one bag (which was mine) of course my family didn't leave me we all were stuck. At the last minute the agent filed a missing bag for to allow us to go through he then called the flight attendant on the plane we were scheduled to leave on and she was so rude and refused to hold the plane for five minutes so my family and I could run the 100m dash to the gate. We got through finally and yes they left us even though it was their fault we missed the connection. Had to trek down to the baggage department with absolutely do direction or help from Air Canada. We finally got back to the departures in Montreal after collecting our remaining bags and a bit of luck we ended up with an agent that was actually concerned and nice for the first time in this whole ordeal. She booked us on a flight in the morning and she arranged to put us up at a near by Marriott and $80 in meal vouchers she was amazing, it gave me hope. Got back to the hotel in Montreal only to get an email that the flight she booked us on in the morning was cancelled and we are now being bumped on to a Delta Flight through Atlanta into Orlando. We never arrived in Orlando until January 3 at midnight. If it hand not being for Air Canada incompetence, the selfish, inconsiderate flight attendant and the laid back agent at customs this could have been avoided.

one had no pilot and the other no fuel,John Smithers,NotVerified,"  Pilot showed up 20 minutes late to an already delayed flight.

Reflecting on my flights this day, one had no pilot and the other no fuel. I don’t have to explain how unprofessional and frankly pathetic this service is.

never experienced such good customer service,K Deane,TripVerified,"  I brought some collapsible hiking poles in my carry-on luggage from Washington DC through Toronto to Calgary on my outbound trip, and then from Calgary to Toronto on my return trip, with no issues from security. But then during a separate pre-US arrival security screening from Toronto to Washington DC, I was told by security that I could not travel with them in my carry-on luggage and my only choices were to abandon them or try to speak to an Air Canada representative to put them in an additional checked bag. After deciding on the latter because of the value of the items, the Air Canada rep I spoke to, went out of his way to shepherd my sister and I all the way out through customs and back in again through security, getting us to the front of the line when he could and when it was appropriate, so that we could make our connecting flight on time. I have never experienced such good customer service with an airline like that before (despite the original issue with my carry-on item).

They have good customer-facing people,P Gerlen,TripVerified,"  When everything goes smoothly, Air Canada is a good airline to fly with. The major problem with them is experiencing how they handle unexpected issues along the way. We were bumped off our flight from Vancouver to Tokyo because we wouldn't make our connection there and at the time, Japan didn't allow stay-overs in the country bacause of strict Covid restrictions. The way the passengers affected were treated from the time we got off the aircraft to the time we were re-booked on another flight the following day was horrible. They have good customer-facing people who are doing their best to deal with such situations, but as a major organization, their leadership never gives them the tools or budget to deal with it appropriately. They need to make major improvements in dealing with crisis situations as they occur. Increased authority at a mid-level management would certainly be a good first step. The managers appear to be doing their best to accomodate the stressful transitioning of customers throughout the airport, but they clearly lack discretionary budgets to keep customers comfortable during the process. No food, drink or emergency staff increases to deal with any of it. Every customer is treated like cattle, running through the loops on their own, not knowing where to go in the terminal to address the next steps, etc. I am rating Air Canada on a corporate level, not on an individual customer-facing staff level.",10th December 2021,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Montreal to Tokyo via Vancouver,December 2021,2,3,2,3,2,1,2,"['Tokyo', 'Vancouver']",2,15.0,7,2.142857142857143,0.7,0.29261363636363635,"['everything', 'goes', 'smoothly', 'good', 'airline', 'fly', 'major', 'problem', 'experiencing', 'handle', 'unexpected', 'issues', 'along', 'way', 'bumped', 'make', 'connection', 'time', 'japan', 'allow', 'country', 'bacause', 'strict', 'covid', 'restrictions', 'way', 'passengers', 'affected', 'treated', 'time', 'aircraft', 'time', 'another', 'following', 'day', 'horrible', 'good', 'people', 'best', 'deal', 'situations', 'major', 'organization', 'leadership', 'never', 'gives', 'tools', 'budget', 'deal', 'appropriately', 'need', 'make', 'major', 'improvements', 'dealing', 'crisis', 'situations', 'occur', 'increased', 'authority', 'management', 'certainly', 'good', 'first', 'step', 'managers', 'appear', 'best', 'accomodate', 'stressful', 'transitioning', 'customers', 'throughout', 'airport', 'clearly', 'lack', 'discretionary', 'budgets', 'keep', 'customers', 'comfortable', 'process', 'food', 'drink', 'emergency', 'staff', 'increases', 'deal', 'every', 'customer', 'treated', 'like', 'cattle', 'running', 'loops', 'knowing', 'terminal', 'address', 'steps', 'etc', 'rating', 'corporate', 'level', 'individual', 'staff', 'level']","['good', 'people']",pos

Next morning we went back to airport and finally made it to Halifax where we missed the wedding we were here to attend.

ruined by unhelpful onboard crew,M Miller,TripVerified,"  Very good product ruined by unhelpful onboard crew. Excellent website, clear flight info and updates, OK checkin, good boarding, excellent newly refurbished aircraft with very comfortable premium economy seating, good cabin ambience, minimum but informative announcements from the cockpit, nice meal and nicely presented on the tray with proper cutlery etc. and large clear personal TV with OK selection of media. The Montreal based onboard crew were ruined by the behaviour of some of the crew even when addressed in fluent first language French. Service on a 8 hour gate to gate flight amounted to 2 very brief per functional pass throughs with zero regular cabin checks.

I was truly disgusted with the service from the airline,Meredith Drost,TripVerified," I am a fairly frequent solo traveler (3-5 flights per year at a minimum) and this was the most disgusting experience I have had with an airline from the cancelation 7 hours before my flight in the middle of the night to the 24 hours delayed arrival to my destination. I had a flight booked for Sunday, August 29th, 2021 scheduled to depart at 7.00 am. I was in town for a wedding and this flight was a one-way direct flight from Halifax, NS to Toronto, ON. At 11.00 pm I received an email from the airline notifying me my flight was canceled ""Due to weather"". I called Air Canada to rebook my flight and after waiting on hold for 2 hours I got through to an agent who would only rebook my flight if I paid an additional fare. He advised me if I wanted another flight for the next day I could get on an 11.00 am flight for an additional $600 or a 7.00 pm flight for an additional $300. This is in addition to the $400 I paid for the initial flight. After much back and forth I requested a supervisor at which point he transfers me through, the supervisor introduces himself, and as I begin speaking he proceeds to hang up on me. I was infuriated as it was late at night and I had nowhere to go and no flight for the next morning. The next day, I call the airline back in the morning (attempting to get someone who would put me on the 11.00 am flight without charging double the amount of the original ticket). I was transferred several times, and on the phone for a total of 5 hours before securing a flight that evening at 7.00 pm and was required to pay the amount of the original flight and they said they would refund the initial ticket (total paid before a refund is not $800 for the flight that was $400 when purchased 2 months before the flight). However, my flight was now scheduled to go to Newfoundland overnight and then in the morning depart to Montreal then Toronto for my final destination. The agent on the phone advised me that when I arrived in NFLD they would be able to help with the hotel situation. I ended up having to pay for the hotel out of pocket ($150 for the hotel + the $800 for the flight = $950 trip so far) when I arrived at the airport because the agents had no idea what I was talking about. Finally, the next morning at 9 am (26 hours after my regional flight and $950 dollars later) I arrive in Toronto. When I get here, not surprisingly, my bags did not make it. They were delivered to my location a day and a half later. I wanted to leave this review to share my experience with Air Canada. I was truly disgusted with the service from the airline, the fact that it is incredibly challenging to speak to anyone, the fact that Air Canada treats its clients as numbers, and the fact that this conglomerate is a company solely focused on making money and has little care about the people affected on their flights. Things may seem okay with this airline when nothing goes wrong (which is seldom) but when it does go wrong, expect your trip to cost more and to spend hours online trying to talk to someone.",4th October 2021,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Halifax, Nova Scotia to Toronto, Ontario",August 2021,1,3,0,0,1,0,1,"['Halifax', 'Toronto', 'Ontario']",3,6.0,4,1.5,-1.0,-0.015653153153153153,"['fairly', 'frequent', 'solo', 'traveler', 'per', 'year', 'minimum', 'disgusting', 'experience', 'airline', 'cancelation', 'hours', 'middle', 'night', 'hours', 'delayed', 'arrival', 'destination', 'booked', 'sunday', 'august', 'scheduled', 'depart', 'town', 'wedding', 'direct', 'ns', 'pm', 'received', 'email', 'airline', 'notifying', 'canceled', 'due', 'weather', 'called', 'rebook', 'waiting', 'hold', 'hours', 'agent', 'rebook', 'paid', 'additional', 'fare', 'advised', 'wanted', 'another', 'day', 'additional', 'pm', 'additional', 'addition', 'paid', 'initial', 'much', 'back', 'forth', 'requested', 'supervisor', 'point', 'transfers', 'supervisor', 'introduces', 'begin', 'speaking', 'proceeds', 'hang', 'infuriated', 'late', 'night', 'nowhere', 'morning', 'day', 'call', 'airline', 'back', 'morning', 'attempting', 'someone', 'put', 'charging', 'double', 'amount', 'original', 'ticket', 'transferred', 'several', 'times', 'phone', 'total', 'hours', 'securing', 'evening', 'pm', 'required', 'pay', 'amount', 'original', 'refund', 'initial', 'ticket', 'total', 'paid', 'refund', 'purchased', 'months', 'scheduled', 'newfoundland', 'overnight', 'morning', 'depart', 'montreal', 'final', 'destination', 'agent', 'phone', 'advised', 'arrived', 'nfld', 'able', 'help', 'hotel', 'situation', 'ended', 'pay', 'hotel', 'pocket', 'hotel', 'trip', 'far', 'arrived', 'airport', 'agents', 'idea', 'talking', 'finally', 'morning', 'hours', 'regional', 'dollars', 'later', 'arrive', 'surprisingly', 'bags', 'make', 'delivered', 'location', 'day', 'half', 'later', 'wanted', 'leave', 'review', 'share', 'experience', 'truly', 'disgusted', 'service', 'airline', 'fact', 'incredibly', 'challenging', 'speak', 'anyone', 'fact', 'treats', 'clients', 'numbers', 'fact', 'conglomerate', 'company', 'solely', 'focused', 'making', 'money', 'little', 'care', 'people', 'affected', 'things', 'may', 'seem', 'okay', 'airline', 'nothing', 'goes', 'wrong', 'seldom', 'wrong', 'expect', 'trip', 'cost', 'spend', 'hours', 'online', 'trying', 'talk', 'someone']","['truly', 'disgusted', 'service', 'airline']",neg

slightly above-average,W James,TripVerified," Flying with Air Canada can be best described as slightly above-average. Not at all great, but most certainly not bad. The check-in agent in Portland who reviewed my flight and pandemic paperwork (to satisfy Canada's requirements) was very serious but also pleasant and helpful. The departure gate was relatively new, as well as secluded and quiet. The Portland gate agent was also courteous. The flight attendants were very serious and not much into pleasantries, but still pleasant when I needed to interact with them. The plane was a bit old, could have been slightly cleaner, but wasn't like a pigsty. The ticket was also a bit pricey considering that this was basically a 1-hour regional flight on a commuter jet (then again, I guess having to pay federal fees to the US and Canada for this flight might explain the price).

"Totally, unpleasant flight",R Kanovic,TripVerified,"  The flight 1421 Varadero-Toronto was delayed an hour. After we boarded the plane, the captain came on to say that we expect to be further delayed because of the paper problems with Cubans where supposedly they might return some of the passengers that he brought on his earlier flight form Toronto, which added almost another hour. Quite unusual, but well. During that hour of waiting aboard the plane, the crew kept reminding passengers via PA and directly to keep the masks on or face fines. Then they made an announcement saying they know we are getting hot and we are hungry and thirsty, but to be patient and once again keep masks on. The next announcement asked people sitting next to the windows to put the shades down so we would not be that hot. Each announcement was given in English, French and Spanish , so talking never stopped. Once we were up in the air, they could not get the safety demonstration video to play properly, so they told us in 3 languages again to read subtitles. The food service was then further delayed because they said there was a medical emergency. Finally, the cart with the food/drinks shows up. Yes, it is Covid, so told us the director of service, as she ""cannot pick up trash while offering food for purchase because she is not supposed to mix clean and dirty"".

no apologies were offered for the inconvenience,CT Apedjinou,NotVerified,"  With over 15 years of travel experience I can definitely say this was the worst I experience. I have not flown on Air Canada for a while and will not be doing so in the near future. This was horrible from the clerk at the baggage drop-off to the boarding hostesses - rude and complete incompetence. It first started at the Air Canada luggage drop off point. The clerk pointed out that my carry-on was too big and requested I paid 115$ for the extra bag. So, I transferred everything to a small bag I had inside and to my other bags. When she weighed everything, one bag was 21 kg and the other 25 (2 kgs over the limit). She requested I remove the extra 2 kg or pay 100 $. I managed to remove the extra weight which she accepted. To my surprise at the gate, the hostess flags my boarding pass during boarding literally calling me a thief because I failed to pay the overweight and oversize fee. I was shocked, I tried to explain that this was an error and there is no way I made it through the security without paying. The hostess flat out told me I was lying and that there was no way for them to know I was telling the truth. They made me wait until all passengers boarded then a supervisor came and confirmed that I was telling the truth and that the clerk made a mistake. I was finally allowed to board. Please note: no apologies were offered for the inconvenience. As I was walking to the airplane to board, I started to experience some cramps in my hips since I was standing for a long time. I had to stopped in the middle of the ramp and wait for the pain to stop. To add to my frustration, here come another hostess asking me to move or she will get my name off the plane! I explained that I am having a cramp and just need a couple of minutes. The lady repeated herself saying that I needed to move or else my name will be removed from the plane. When she saw I ignored her and was still holding my hip she run off to the counter saying - ""that’s it, I am removing your name from the flight"".. I was really shocked I have never had in one encounter so many unkind people. This was a night flight and I imagine everyone was exhausted but the treatment I received was beyond unimaginable. The humiliation over and over again.

absolutely no service for stranded passengers,Maurice House,NotVerified,  Air Canada has no class. They cancelled my return flight and left me stranded in Morocco. They would not allow my travel agent to exchange my ticket with another airline. At the last hour flight prices on other airlines had doubled. Air Canada offered a partial refund which did not cover half the fair to get home. Big loss for me and absolutely no service for stranded passengers. The head steward on my flight was a mask Nazi. I was very aware and cooperative. But it is very awkward putting on a mask every time they pass you while eating or drinking. No common sense at all.

never been so disappointed,Beau Laughlin,TripVerified,"  I booked a domestic flight (In the same province) originally on July 30th for 1:20pm. I showed up at Vancouver Airport at 12:00pm. It was my mistake this day for showing up too close to the time and I had to cancel because I missed the flight. Went back home All good I booked the flight through Expedia, got a refund and my expedia account was re-issued the credits again. Booked through Expedia for another flight for the next day to the same location. Flight was scheduled for 8:05am. Ok I decided to show up 2 and a half hours before the flight just to be safe. Get to the airport at roughly 5:30am, standing in line to check in and the lineup doesn't look too long. But They only have 3 people working the computers and the line moves incredibly slow. After almost an hour and twenty minutes of waiting in line I start to panic because I have only made it a little over halfway through this lineup. I start flagging down Air Canada staff to alert them that I may miss my flight if things don't speed up. Alerted one girl and she said : ""ok sir, someone will be over to assist you."" 15 minutes goes by with no assistance and I alert another girl. She gives me the same line as the other girl. And the same exact outcome. Nobody comes to assist me. After 15 more minutes I hop over the rope to the counter and beg them to please have someone come over and help me, or I will miss my flight. Again the girl tries to re-assure me they will help me and tells me to get back in line. Well after 2+ hours in line, and not one Air Canada staff coming over to help After I had asked. I'm one person away from being helped at the front counter. And just feel defeated. I step up to the front and talk to the girl and she tells me immediately that I have missed my flight. I can't describe my frustration, I even left well before my flight just to be able to make the flight in time. Two and a half hours before my flight and I still missed it. And this was a domestic flight. I have never in my life had to give myself so much time to make a flight, let alone a hour and a half flight. And still miss the flight. Air Canada offered no compensation and also did not appear to have any sympathy for my situation. I still had to fly up that day to go up for work, so I was desperate to get on a flight. Luckily a Westjet flight to the same destination was available. I walked over to the Westjet lineup, which was the same size as the Air Canada lineup. Managed to get through the line, book my flight and check on my bag within 15 minutes. Yes, within 15 minutes I did all of that. To top it all off, I canceled my flight through Expedia. Got the credit for Air Canada flights on my expedia account. Decided to try and book another flight with my available credit, but the expedia representative told me he couldn't book it because Air Canada had suspended my ticket, and I needed to call Air Canada to open it. Try to call Air Canada and they said they aren't taking any calls at the moment. Anyways I'm stuck with a 900$ balance for Air Canada that I now can't use until they get back to me. And will probably have to book through westjet to get back home which means even more money I will have to shell out due to Air Canada.

did put me on another flight,H Mahden,TripVerified,"  I use to travel with Air Canada for many years and never had any issues. Since the past 3 years I've encountered several problem that I am now doubting Air Canada. On my way from BC to California the entire way was pretty smooth and the pilot was friendly along with the staff. The problem was coming back from California to BC. Unfortunately my flight got delayed by 25 minutes when I landed in BC I had a connecting flight. I had to undergo the entire PCR, boarder security check. When I spoke to Air Canada I told them I have a connecting flight and with the looks of it I may not make it. I was told its okay we have time and my check-in was done so they will hold the flight for me. I got to security screening and long line up, I than again told the Air Canada person I have a connecting flight I need to go my flight will leave AT 5:20 which means boarding must've ended at 5:05 and I was at security till 5:10. I than rushed so fast to get to the gate and my flight took off! Air Canada did put me on another flight that took off at 8:45PM.

over four months to get a refund,Richard Lavallee,TripVerified,"  Still not sure why it is taking over four months to get a refund from covid tickets bought last September. Originally forced to get aeroplan points, then we could get refund via original form of payment. In April the refund site would at least tell you what date of originally purchased tickets refund they were working on. Then May 26th they stopped reporting any dates at all also basically said don’t call customer service, they can’t give you information. I have a diary of all the times I’ve reached out and never have I heard of a major company being so distant to the consumer.  Yesterday (8/24) I finally took on the 1hr hold thru customer service just trying to get information. I was told that she has talked to other people who have been waiting nine months (is this supposed to make me feel better?) she will send up my information and “they” should let me know something shortly.

I did file for reimbursement,B Deane,TripVerified,"  Flight in Chicago had a 4 hour delay so we were delayed, almost missed our connection Air Canada let everyone off the plane instead of just the people with the imminent connections. Being on the back of the plane, things didn't look good Following that the agents barely listened to our questions on how to get to connections in time; instead directed us to customs and immigration. After 30 minutes in line, got to the customs agent, he says, ""why are you here? I'll walk you to connections."" Of course we missed the plane. Then the air Canada customer support agent in Toronto was useless. He let it slip that just the 4 of us missed our flight. And that it was our problem. We couldn't leave the airport and gave us one hotel room for 4 people. Went to CBP and again, they say ""why weren't you escorted""? We weren't supposed to walk where the Air Canada agents sent us alone.  I did file for reimbursement, but judging by the job Air Canada's done so far, that won't happen. They proceeded to lose our luggage and return it to us on our 9th and last day of our trip.

total lack of guidance,R Morris,NotVerified,"  Will try to never fly with Air Canada again after our experience.  Minutes before we were to board the final leg of a return flight from Rome, Italy - the Toronto to IAD Washington leg - AC7708, that flight was cancelled by Air Canada. All the passengers on what we were told was a full flight were directed to the AC customer services desk elsewhere in the airport. When we arrived there we learned another AC flight to Pittsburgh had also been cancelled. The Washington bound group joined at the back of this line of what was probably 300+ people. Over the next three+ hours no announcements to all the people in line were offered by AC customer service staff. At various times when Canadian citizen passengers, who were given vouchers on the spot and escorted past us out of the terminal by AC customer service staff, different AC staff gave incomplete and varying information in response to questions from non-Canadian citizen passengers. We were told we could not leave that area of the terminal due to Covid restrictions. We were told it would be days for us to find flights to final destinations - especially if there were multiple passengers on one booking etc. The total lack of guidance by AC staff to passengers led many to search for options. Also the customer service line was not moving as they were short staffed and having major computer rebooking issues. With 10pm approaching, no movement in the rebooking line, horror stories from other US passengers closer to the AC desk hearing rebooked flights for Thursday soonest etc., we felt we had to act. We began hearing also that Airport Security would not let us remain in the airport overnight. We secured a one-way car rental and drove 9 hours back to DC. At no time was a hotel stay offered by Air Canada or any talk of a voucher due to the cancellation. It was a total failure by them to communicate guidance for a situation that they - not the weather or other forces beyond their control - had caused. We are being told now by the Air Canada website that it will be 60 days for a reply to refund request due to a flight cancellation.

will not get any compensation,Rumana Sobhan,TripVerified,"  I was travelling from Los Angeles to Montreal by Air Canada along with my family yesterday. The plane we supposed to board got delayed for two and half hours at Los Angeles airport, we received food voucher there by an Air Canada agent. After landing at Toronto we got stuck on the plane for another one hour because of the traffic. Because of the covid situation we had to do our immigration and baggage claim in the Toronto airport. We were told by the Air Canada we will get hotel vouchers as we missed our connected flight because of the delay. We were directed to aisle number 7 and 8 of Air Canada for the hotels voucher. After waiting for about 3 hours in the queue when we got a chance to see the rep at the counter we were told that we are not eligible for the hotel voucher. And the representative didn’t want to help us and constantly misbehaving with us.  Later the manager explained it was not the airlines fault as we got delayed by the customs at Los Angeles airport. But we didn’t do our custom at Los Angeles. And he also added we will not get hotel voucher and will not get any compensation.  Such a bad customer service.

Air Canada has not compensated me,A Malson,TripVerified,"  I booked my flight from Toronto to Kamloops via Vancouver using reward points in June 2021. I booked my seat at the time of booking the flight - choosing 2A. A couple of days later I received a notification that my seat had been changed to 3A - not a big deal. On the 14th of August, I checked in online for my flight. A minute or two after checking in I received a notification that my seat was being changed to 28D - economy class, and minute or so after that another notification that my seat was changed again to 19D (may have been premium economy). I went into my bookings on the Air Canada website and my seat still showed as 3A. Next morning just to be sure I phoned Air Canada and after 1 hour 22 minutes, the agent confirmed I was in 3A from what she could see. I went to the airport and checked in at the counter and the agent printed me a boarding card for 19D. Told him this was not acceptable and explained what had taken place the day before. He then found an open seat in business class - seat 1D and gave me a new boarding card with my baggage tag attached. While going through security my phone alerted me to a message indicated my seat had changed and I was now in 27J (economy), and a few minutes later a new seat change to 21D, and then another change to 12D (Premium economy). Asked the agents in the lounge and they said I should go to the gate and check as it is a involuntary downgrade. The agent at the gate had my new boarding card for 12D. He said however I should wait until the entire plane boarded in case someone was a no show in business class. I ended up in 12D. There was absolutely no explanation as to why any of this happened, and how a person who has paid for business class (even if it was with points) can have their seat changed after they have checked in for the flight. It is now five days later and Air Canada has not compensated me. On top of this my connecting flight to Kamloops was cancelled due to weather and when I went to collect my bag and could not find it I realized that the agent did not transfer my baggage tag on my original boarding card to the new one printed.

not resolving problems professionally,Jason Gilroy,TripVerified,"  They couldn’t have screwed things up any worse than they already have. Took me 12h to fly 1,000km, with one connecting flight. it would have been faster, easier, and cheaper to drive. I couldn’t afford any screw-ups so I booked the day’s earliest flight, 3 weeks in advance. I showed up 2h early. My flight was delayed 1h, not a huge deal, I should still make my connecting flight. Only to learn upon landing in Toronto that my flight was cancelled in less than 2h from departure time - my cancelled flight was re-booked for the day’s last flight - there were many earlier flights available, which customer service would not give me because they would have to locate my bag. This turned a 1h layover into a 9h layover, and I was already stranded in another city at this point, I couldn’t very well cancel my ticket. 33 people in line, ONE customer service representative. Took me 1.5h to move my way to the front of the cue.

business class had one cold dinner option,S Karziel,TripVerified,"  The Signature Class check-in experience in Toronto was pathetic. There were only 4 us in the designated Signature Class check in hall but it still took almost 30 min. The agents seem confused. The lounge is a bare bones version of the domestic lounge (not Signature Class). So if you are flying from the gates you have to leave the lounge way in advance of your flight. An overnight, trans-Atlantic flight in business class had one cold dinner option consisting of a pea falafel. The mid flight snack was a basket of kit kats and nuts. Very limited drinks service. I woke up early and asked for breakfast. The flight attendant said I can't give it to you now because others will see and ask for it. Breakfast was even more pathetic: the menu said it was a croissant but it came in a plastic wrap with some fruit, etc. Given the state of breakfast, she could have easily served it to me when requested.

experience this week was awful,P Hewett,TripVerified,"  I've flown with Air Canada more than any other airline in the past 5 years, and I've always ignored small unpleasant comments from ground and flight staff as well as poor organization and flight problems because flying Air Canada was often the only option available (or at least slightly more affordable) and I accepted it as a means to an end. However, my experience this week was awful. It started with a 3.5 to 4-hour line  to the check-in counter. We were told that self check-in isn't available so everyone had to wait in a single line. Most people ended up missing their flights. The airline only had four counters available and would not offer any communication to anyone who was worried about their flight.  At one point many of us reaching the front of the line were asked to break off and form a new line off to the side to make more space. After about 45 minutes of waiting, a new staff member asked us why we were standing there and told us our line doesn't lead anywhere. She told us we have to go back to the end of the line we were previously in if we wanted to be served. When other passengers became frustrated and mentioned that we have been waiting the longest and were asked to stand there, the ground staff responded that it wasn't true and that there was no way we've been waiting for 3 hours so far. Some people reacted by yelling while others started to cry from frustration. Once I finally made it to the check-in counter, I was told that all the other flights to Boston that day were full so my only option was to be placed on stand-by for all the flights in hopes that one of them would have extra space. I was told to wait at each gate one hour before a flight departs to see if my name was called. Luckily, I was able to board a flight that day and made it to Boston in the evening. When I arrived, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I went to the luggage service desk to inquire about it and was told that my luggage was not put on my flight because there was too much weight on the flight and it was better to take all the passengers to their destination than load all the luggage. If I knew this would have been the case, I would have much preferred to not board my flight and keep my personal items than arrive in a different country without my belongings. I was told the luggage would arrive on another flight and could be delivered to the place I was staying on the next day. I left all my contact information and had to hope for the best. The next day, I checked the online status of my luggage and it said that it had been loaded onto a delivery truck at 2pm. I waited and waited for it to arrive, but nothing came. I called Air Canada and they told me that the luggage will arrive anytime before 11:30pm. I didn't want to miss the delivery so I spent the first day of my trip just waiting. By midnight, no one had arrived. It is now the next day and I'm still waiting.

update their policies regarding transit visas,Thea Gatchalian,TripVerified,"  Supposed to be my original flight was July 31st YWG to YVR then YVR to NRT via Air Canada and layover of 24h 20m HND to MNL via Philippine Airlines. My flight schedule was changed several times by another booking agency. The time I was about to check-in in Winnipeg, Air Canada didn’t give me my boarding pass and didn’t allow me to board my plane because according to them, my layover in Japan should only be less than 24 hours in order for me not to avail a transit visa. I researched a couple of times before my flight and I found out that a passenger is allowed to transit to Japan without a visa up to 72 hours with a confirmed ticket and if there are no available flights on the said date of arrival. Air Canada told me to call my booking agency and to adjust my layover time. But there are no longer available flights possible for that day. I was forced to book a new plane ticket amounting to $2937.46 including taxes on an economy ticket for the next day.  Air Canada was so useless and I felt so disappointed because I have to travel back home again for an hour travel time and my brother who fetched me to the airport was already gone back home.  I found the airline very inconsiderate and I hope they will update their policies regarding transit visas.

Covid test I had taken was unacceptable,L Cotterell,NotVerified,"  I recently made reservations for a flight from Toronto to Newark on June 30th. My original reservation was for 230pm and arriving in Newark at 401pm. My flight was cancelled while sitting on the plane waiting for it to takeoff. The reason for the cancellation was ""a tornado warning."" Meanwhile in Newark it was 98 degrees and sunny. Everyone from that flight was made to stand on a long line while waiting on ONE customer service representative to attend to the 100 plus people from my flight and trying to assist an additional 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations. Needless to say the 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations were attended to while myself and the passengers that had been deplaned were told after an hour to come back tomorrow because our flight had been postponed to 8am the following day (July 1st). We had made reservations to drive from Newark to Ocean City MD for a two night stay but due to Air Canada we did not make it and we were only able to enjoy half a day and a one night stay and due to it being the Fourth of July no extensions were being offered. So we basically payed $400 for a room and extra for a flight with no compensations.  On July 6th at 8am I boarded a United flight from Philadelphia to Washington with and hour and half stop over in Washington where I was boarding an Air Canada flight at 1030am to Toronto. When I went to check in for my flight to Toronto I was told that the Covid test that I had taken was unacceptable and I was required to have a PCR test in order to board any flight to Canada. So I missed the 1030am flight, and went downstairs to get a rapid PCR test done. $250 USD later I received a negative PCR test and made my way back to the Air Canada counter to see if I was able to get on a later flight.  When I approached the Air Canada counter the gentleman rudely tried to give me a card with Air Canada's Customer service number (that I have been trying to call for days to find out information regarding Covid testing) I told him ""please don't try to give me that number you know  that no one answers that phone.""

agents did not pay attention to detail,H Barten,TripVerified,"  I flew business class on Air Canada from Newark to Doha via Toronto. I was connecting to my favorite airline, Qatar. I was looking forward to the service. However, AC was terrible. Check in at EWR was hectic. The agents did not pay attention to detail and gave me boarding passes belonging to someone else. Not a huge deal.  My flight arrived to Toronto late and I arrived at the gate just as they were calling for final boarding. I went to the agent and gave her all of the documentation she asked for without comment as I was catching my breath. At the end of it all, she said, ""you could be nicer you know"" I asked what her problem was and that I had given her everything that she asked for and that she was not particularly nice either.  The flight was terrible for business class. They had one menu with no options. The dinner was good, but breakfast was inedible. The seat was very comfortable and the flight attendants friendly. However, Air Canada has taken cost cutting in business class to a low. I connect to Qatar on a five hour flight. They had numerous menu options and better good. It is interesting how North Americans want to complain about the Middle Eastern carriers and their subsidies. However, the North American carriers get subsidies as well. Where they can't compete is service. If I am spending over $3000 on a business class ticket, and my choices are Air Canada or a Middle Eastern carrier, I would be a fool to spend my money on Air Canada.  I wrote Air Canada and almost 4 weeks later have been given the courtesy of a response.

Any other airline in the world would have treated this issue fairly (from experience). I am sure all Canadians would love to feel pride in our main airline and feel appreciated and be respected by a company that carries our flag around the globe. In reality, this airline is absolutely shameful, it abuses its customers every single day, and by the looks of it none of their employees are proud to represent this company either.

Shame on you all,Patricia Laver,TripVerified, A warning to those thinking of purchasing a ticket with Air Canada. They are in the practice of refusing to refund the purchase price even after they choose to cancel the flight. In these Covid days flights are frequently cancelled through lack of passenger capacity.

Most unbelievable customer service,Brendan Connolly,NotVerified,"  We booked a flight through Air Canada for our honeymoon for 10/26.

Due to time constraints and not missing our honeymoon, we booked through another airline. We finally got a hold of customer support and they said that they can’t refund us because it was a “schedule change”. They cancelled the whole flight!

credit of $350 only good for $43 dollars,M Barson,TripVerified,"  Air Canada changed the flight itinerary for a Toronto-Seattle flight, and I could no longer make the flight due to this change. They offered to convert the value of my flight ($350) into a credit that I could use at a later date. I thought this was great, and proceeded to apply the credit to a different flight (Toronto-Dublin) which costs $590 on the AirCanada website, taxes included (Image attached). I would've expected that my $350 credit would be applied to the new $590 flight, and I'd just have to pay the remaining balance of $240. This is not what happened. The credit of $350 was only good for $43 dollars on this new flight, and the rest of the credit vanished ($307), and I'm now at a net expense of $853 because I was charged an additional $546 ""tax charge"" for the new Dublin flight booking (on top of the remaining $307 credit value that couldn't be applied and doesn't exist anymore). I was not informed that it would have been better to use my credit for the same Toronto-Seattle route, instead of applying the credit to a new destination where the taxes aren't transferable. So after realizing this on my own, I then tried to cancel that new booking to Dublin and receive a refund for the $546, as it was still within 24 hours of the booking confirmation. This way I could keep my original $350 credit to save for a later date to use for Seattle specifically, and get full use of the credit value, and just book the Dublin flight separately on my own. However, they said this was also not possible, as a new booking made with a credit isn't the same as a regular booking, so the 24 hour rule doesn't apply, and I'm left short $307 in credit value that doesn't exist. I've contacted their customer relations department, and they've responded saying they cannot assist me.  I've had multiple trip cancellations with other airlines, where my credits were kept and applied for the full value of the ticket. I don't understand how $350 dollars in credit only becomes $43 in usable valuable, while the rest goes down the drain. Don't advertise increased flexibility with credits and vouchers, when in fact they are imaginary and will leave you short hundreds of dollars. I hope this helps with other people who aren't sure what to do about a flight credit/ voucher with Air Canada.

They would only give me credits,Zeina Habib,TripVerified,  I was supposed to fly Beirut to Boston via London and Toronto with Middle east Airlines and Air Canada.

your flight got cancelled,Feroz Khan,TripVerified,"  My recent flight with Air Canada on March 17th, 2020. I was returning from Nadi via Los Angeles to Vancouver. When I arrived in Los Angeles tried checking in at the kiosk machine would not work so got help with Air Canada personnel standing at the kiosk. He also could not do it so send me to the check in counter. The lady at the counter after sometime on the computer said so your flight got cancelled a month ago and email was sent to all the passengers and told me to contact my travel agent in Vancouver.

I went back to the same lady on the counter and said our bags are already checked in she told us to go to terminal 5 to talk to the Air Canada agents to get our bags. On the way to terminal 5 I started thinking, I did not book my tickets a month ago and I did not receive any emails from air Canada. At terminal 5 the agent said we have to go back to terminal 6 they would be responsible for our luggage. On the way back to terminal 6 I asked my son who also was travelling with me lets take a look at the reader board with all the flight information, that’s when I saw that our flight got cancelled and also had our flight number. I went back to the check in counter at demanded to speak with a supervisor and first she refused after arguing with load voices she agreed to get the supervisor. I waited for almost 25 minutes before a supervisor approached. I was so upset told the supervisor please pay our accommodation, transportation cost and meals if you want us to stay in Los Angles. The supervisor said wait and after doing some work on the computer she told me that we can get a flight at 11.00 pm same day our original flight was at 3 pm with no food allowance.

I missed the boarding call,Doug Greenall,TripVerified,"  In December 2019 Air Canada cancelled my return ticket home while I was in Colombia. The return ticket included one domestic leg (Cartagena to Bogota) then two more legs, first to Toronto and then Vancouver. I missed the boarding call for the third leg of my incoming ticket so Air Canada, without even contacting me, cancelled all three of my flights home. After I missed my final short flight from Bogota to Medellin, I purchased another ticket from Latam Airlines, the local carrier for my last flight.  I spent six days using international minutes trying to reach Air Canada from Medellin. I tried everything under the sun to get a human voice on the line. Finally a friend of mine in Canada reached them, and after two and a half hours, got my flights home (the ones I’d already paid for) reinstated for $150. The money is the least of my concerns. The fact that Air Canada was unreachable is unprofessional.  Air Canada also left my luggage in Toronto and took their sweet time getting it to me.

they were still able to put a somewhat decent service together,A Wong,TripVerified," Vancouver to Hong Kong. First things first, I flew business class after Covid-19 measures were implemented, so I came in expecting reduced cabin service, and that was what I got. That being said, even with all the precautionary measures, I was surprised that they were still able to put a somewhat decent service together. Air Canada uses the B/E Aerospace (Now Collins Aerospace) Super Diamond seats, which arrange passengers in a reverse herringbone configuration. It's a pretty standard product, though I must say I really like the colour scheme that Air Canada uses. It just looks really clean and the colours contrast nicely. Due COVID-19, I requested the upgrade to business as a precautionary measure, and I wasn't disappointed. Even with reduced cabin services, it was still a nice experience. Sure, there's no pillow or bar service- they've warned about this on their website, but as it turned out, when they said they would be serving pre-packaged meals, all they meant was that they weren't going to plate your meal for you. It was still business quality (veal from Hawksworth), but they simply didn't give you that picture perfect plating that is so greatly appreciated. Despite the lack of a pillow, the seats were still quite comfortable, though it could still do with more lumbar support, and the lack of a pillow made the sleeping position a tad awkward because my head was dipped backwards even with the power adjustable headrest. Service could admittedly be a bit more polished, though to be fair, part of this definitely has to do with the COVID-19 precautions. I should probably try upgrading again when this blows over. I do appreciate how quiet the cabin was, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the food quality was not compromised as a result of their infection control measures.",29th March 2020,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Vancouver to Hong Kong,March 2020,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,['Vancouver'],1,31.0,7,4.428571428571429,0.3333333333333333,0.2176666666666667,"['hong', 'kong', 'first', 'things', 'first', 'flew', 'business', 'class', 'measures', 'implemented', 'came', 'expecting', 'reduced', 'cabin', 'service', 'precautionary', 'measures', 'surprised', 'still', 'able', 'put', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'service', 'together', 'uses', 'aerospace', 'collins', 'aerospace', 'super', 'diamond', 'seats', 'arrange', 'passengers', 'reverse', 'herringbone', 'configuration', 'pretty', 'standard', 'product', 'though', 'must', 'really', 'like', 'colour', 'scheme', 'uses', 'looks', 'really', 'clean', 'colours', 'contrast', 'nicely', 'due', 'requested', 'upgrade', 'business', 'precautionary', 'measure', 'disappointed', 'reduced', 'cabin', 'services', 'still', 'nice', 'experience', 'sure', 'pillow', 'bar', 'warned', 'website', 'turned', 'serving', 'meals', 'meant', 'going', 'plate', 'meal', 'still', 'business', 'quality', 'veal', 'hawksworth', 'simply', 'give', 'picture', 'perfect', 'plating', 'greatly', 'appreciated', 'despite', 'lack', 'pillow', 'seats', 'still', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'though', 'still', 'lumbar', 'support', 'lack', 'pillow', 'sleeping', 'position', 'tad', 'awkward', 'head', 'dipped', 'backwards', 'power', 'adjustable', 'headrest', 'service', 'admittedly', 'bit', 'polished', 'though', 'fair', 'part', 'definitely', 'precautions', 'probably', 'try', 'upgrading', 'blows', 'appreciate', 'quiet', 'cabin', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'food', 'quality', 'compromised', 'result', 'infection', 'control', 'measures']","['still', 'able', 'put', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'service', 'together']",pos

cancellation was beyond their control,E Charden,TripVerified,"  Washington to Quebec City via Montreal. We boarded the flight, but while we were awaiting takeoff we had to evacuate the plane due to a mechanical issue. After waiting a couple of hours for counter assistance, we were rebooked for another flight. We were advised that we could not continue on to Quebec that night, but would be rebooked for a flight the next day. Unfortunately, the flight was also delayed again and we arrived quite late When we arrived in Montreal the counter agents deliberated over whether we qualified for lodging as we had been promised, and we received a lecture on Air Canada’s cancelation policies. We were eventually provided hotel and meal vouchers, given directions to the shuttle, and confirmed our reservations for the flight for the next day. Our flight was cancelled the next morning due to weather, and we received an email notification that we were rescheduled for a flight two days later. We called Customer Service to see if we could get an earlier flight; the representative informed us we were scheduled for the earliest flight he could get us on to Quebec City. Since we would not have had any time 8n Quebec we decided to cancel our vacation and requested return flights Our return flight was delayed due to “Crew Availability Issues”. This delay would cause us to miss connecting flight in Ottawa. We immediately contacted the Air Canada agent at the boarding desk, who rescheduled us onto a direct flight to our home. Our Air Canada experience can be summarized as such: two flight cancellations, one for mechanical issues and one weather related; three delays, causing us to miss connections; cancellation of our Quebec Winter Carnival vacation plans; computer issues, and a stressful experience for my wife and me I think you can agree our experience with Air Canada was not universally positive. I think it is important to emphasize that if our original flight had not been cancelled for mechanical issues we would have arrived in Québec City before the snowstorm and enjoyed our vacation. We filed a claim with Air Canada for our (first) cancelled flight based on your policy of recompense for cancelled and delayed flights. Their official response was to claim the flight cancellation was beyond their control, but offered us a 15% discount on our next Air Canada flight.

no winter clothes and baggage,M Smith,TripVerified,"  Before we left for our trip at the beginning of February flights were cancelled due to avoiding China, which is understandable but we were unable to call anyone from Air Canada due to their higher than normal call volume and were unable to put-on hold, just completely hung up on. We lost all of our selected seating that we had picked and ended up with not the seats we had selected. My food was garbage. On the way home our last of 3 flights was cancelled and we were stranded in Toronto for two days. We were unable to speak to anyone regarding our baggage and how to re book flights. I have a hard time believing this as we are in Canada and there are storms all the time. The was completely unacceptable. Returning to the airport the next morning to hopefully retrieve our baggage we found out that our bags had been forwarded to Winnipeg. So we have no winter clothes and baggage for the remainder of the 2 days in Toronto in February.

we were relatively surprised,A Fitzpatrick,NotVerified,"  I have to say that we were relatively surprised on a recent return trip from Sydney to Vancouver and back. The departures were within 10 minutes of planned take-off times, and arrivals were either on-time or early. Check-in at both airports was very straight-forward and special thanks to the lovely ground staff lady at Vancouver who helped with our self check-in / bag drop at the airport. The crew did their job but lack the polish and personal attention to detail that you receive with the likes of Emirates and Qatar (which is one of the reasons why they are among the worlds best airlines, and Air Canada isn't). We flew Premium Economy and I'm glad we did as I felt sorry for any passengers flying in economy in a full plane on the return flight. The food service in PE was poor with rubbery, burnt omelette, rock hard bread rolls and tasteless chicken on the return route - not helped by being offered only one small glass of wine. While the entertainment system was very good and extremely easy to navigate, the earphones offered in PE were next to useless. The provision of toilets on the aircraft was rather disproportionate with 5 lavatories for 260 economy / premium economy passengers against 3 for 40 business passengers.

Even for very simple flights like Montreal - NYC or Montreal - Miami they are late. Last time I went to Miami, flight delayed of 6 hours. Last time I went to NYC (1 hour flight), flight delayed of 2 hours. Don’t bother bringing a carry on: they never have space for them.

our seats were changed,Gabriel Valente,NotVerified," Toronto to Rome via London. Air Canada treats Aeroplan members as second class citizens I am posting this warning to all those you fly with Air Canada and who use air miles to book flights. Air Canada clearly discriminates amongst its passengers. This is now my second experience and hence definitive confirmation of these discriminatory practices. I recently booked a flight to Europe from Toronto using my aeroplan miles. Upon booking my 2 flights I went through the seat selection process, selected seats and paid $125 each for that privilege. The payment was processed by Air Canada and written confirmation received of those specific seat allocations via email. Weeks later I received an “Air Canada – SEAT CHANGE” notification, arbitrarily moving our seats from Row 18 (seats bought and paid for – for extra legroom due to a leg issue I have) to Row 33. and then said I would be refunded the seat selection fees. Completely arbitrary and not honoring the initial seat purchase! Since this was the second time this has happened to me, (the first time being much worse, which I will explain later on in this message) I had to speak out. I immediately emailed Air Canada after trying to get a hold of their customer service Dept – advised by an automated call that the wait time was more than 1.5 hrs - really? Maybe this is a factor of the significant quantum of customer complaint volume. I then received the token automated response to my submission form Air Canada “we will address your concern within 30 days”. Hence my public action here! As noted this is the second time this has happened. In 2018, on flights to/from Miami for attending a family wedding, I had booked 4 seats using Aeroplan miles and paid full fare for one seat (full-fare seat for my disabled father) in upgraded seating. We booked almost 8 months in advance, with the express purpose of early booking, being getting our seats assigned together so as to assist my disabled father on/off the plan and supporting him during the flights. Eight months early! All our seat selections were confirmed in writing to us by Air Canada at that time. Again, just before the flight (a week before) we get a notification that our seats were changed. Let me clarify this point - only our Aeroplan booked seats were changed! Not my father’s full-fare seat! I called to complain, they said it just happens. It was too close to the flight to seek any other remedy. In the end, it left us sitting in the back of the plane and my father sitting alone with strangers and without support to deal with his disability! Unbelievable! After our return, I complained through proper AC channels to ascertain the genesis of the change notice, highlighting the blatant fact that only the seats booked with air miles were changed and not full-fare seat. The AC response again was, it happens! The offered me a 25% discount coupon for a future flight. I don’t want coupons! I want honest, fair and non-discriminatory service from a Canadian company. Disgraceful! Now this has happened again and cannot stay silent as it is now clear beyond any doubt that Air Canada discriminates against its passengers. There is one level of service for full-fare passengers and another for Aeroplan members who use air miles to book flights. I encourage all others who have experienced this type of discriminatory treat to rise up and make Air Canada take notice and correct their business practices.",16th February 2020,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Rome via London,February 2020,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"['Toronto', 'Rome', 'London']",3,7.0,7,1.0,0.0,0.07305555555555555,"['via', 'treats', 'aeroplan', 'members', 'second', 'class', 'citizens', 'posting', 'warning', 'fly', 'use', 'miles', 'book', 'clearly', 'discriminates', 'amongst', 'passengers', 'second', 'experience', 'hence', 'definitive', 'confirmation', 'discriminatory', 'practices', 'recently', 'booked', 'europe', 'using', 'aeroplan', 'miles', 'upon', 'booking', 'seat', 'selection', 'process', 'selected', 'seats', 'paid', 'privilege', 'payment', 'processed', 'written', 'confirmation', 'received', 'specific', 'seat', 'allocations', 'via', 'email', 'weeks', 'later', 'received', 'seat', 'change', 'notification', 'arbitrarily', 'moving', 'seats', 'row', 'seats', 'bought', 'paid', 'extra', 'legroom', 'due', 'leg', 'issue', 'row', 'refunded', 'seat', 'selection', 'fees', 'completely', 'arbitrary', 'honoring', 'initial', 'seat', 'purchase', 'since', 'second', 'time', 'happened', 'first', 'time', 'much', 'worse', 'explain', 'later', 'message', 'speak', 'immediately', 'emailed', 'trying', 'hold', 'customer', 'service', 'dept', 'advised', 'automated', 'call', 'wait', 'time', 'hrs', 'really', 'maybe', 'factor', 'significant', 'quantum', 'customer', 'complaint', 'volume', 'received', 'token', 'automated', 'response', 'submission', 'form', 'address', 'concern', 'within', 'days', 'hence', 'public', 'action', 'noted', 'second', 'time', 'happened', 'attending', 'family', 'wedding', 'booked', 'seats', 'using', 'aeroplan', 'miles', 'paid', 'full', 'fare', 'seat', 'seat', 'disabled', 'father', 'upgraded', 'seating', 'booked', 'almost', 'months', 'advance', 'express', 'purpose', 'early', 'booking', 'getting', 'seats', 'assigned', 'together', 'assist', 'disabled', 'father', 'plan', 'supporting', 'eight', 'months', 'early', 'seat', 'selections', 'confirmed', 'writing', 'time', 'week', 'notification', 'seats', 'changed', 'let', 'clarify', 'point', 'aeroplan', 'booked', 'seats', 'changed', 'father', 'seat', 'called', 'complain', 'happens', 'close', 'seek', 'remedy', 'end', 'left', 'sitting', 'back', 'plane', 'father', 'sitting', 'alone', 'strangers', 'support', 'deal', 'disability', 'unbelievable', 'return', 'complained', 'proper', 'ac', 'channels', 'ascertain', 'genesis', 'change', 'notice', 'highlighting', 'blatant', 'fact', 'seats', 'booked', 'miles', 'changed', 'seat', 'ac', 'response', 'happens', 'offered', 'discount', 'coupon', 'future', 'want', 'coupons', 'want', 'honest', 'fair', 'service', 'canadian', 'company', 'disgraceful', 'happened', 'stay', 'silent', 'clear', 'beyond', 'doubt', 'discriminates', 'passengers', 'level', 'service', 'passengers', 'another', 'aeroplan', 'members', 'use', 'miles', 'book', 'encourage', 'others', 'experienced', 'type', 'discriminatory', 'treat', 'rise', 'make', 'take', 'notice', 'correct', 'business', 'practices']","['seats', 'changed']",pos

Late leaving and late to arrive so missed the connecting flight but this can happen so no biggie there I guess. Did well to find a practical solution to this and didn’t lose our baggage which was very much appreciated. CIgnored by staff when the assistance light was on.

AC have lost my bag,Mike Palmer,TripVerified,"  Toronto to New York LGA return. The majority of flights on this route are currently operated by Sky Regional on E175s under the Air Canada Express banner. This morning, waiting at the gate, we got the preboard announcement, followed a minute later by a PA stating the flight was now cancelled due to the aircraft going tech. (followed by a text from AC) Rebooking is automatic and took 15 mins. I found myself (probably due to a low fare class) albeit 50K elite, on a flight at 1320 – some 4.15 hours after my original flight time. A paltry 10 bucks for refreshments was offered (try buying something to eat and drink at Pearson for ten bucks!!) Prior to boarding my new flight, the gate staff confirmed my bag was on the tarmac ready to be loaded. Two handlers at the bottom of the jetty confirmed that 15 bags had been loaded from an earlier flight. Despite these reassurances, having waited at the baggage reclaim – no bag. A queue to report it, an incorrectly filed report by the AC agent, the online system reported my bag would land at 2100 but no bag arrived that evening. On chasing AC the following morning by phone, it turns out my bag had iust been delivered to hotel reception – some 18 hours after I had landed and 11 hours since the bag arrived in New York.

there was no service whatsoever,Joseph Bubyn,NotVerified,"  Flew into Tokyo from Bangkok on ANA, Nippon on a 787, economy class. We were offered water within 30 minutes of takeoff, a full elaborate and delicious dinner after an hour, then another drink service half an hour after that. We were offered a snak and drink again before landing. All of this on a 4.5 hour flight. The seats were a comfortable width with good leg room. This was a great flight experience. We were connecting on Air Canada Flight 2 to Toronto, connection time was 55 minutes, we were at the gate in about 25 minutes, boarding had not started, we boarded and lifted off about 45 minutes late, something about baggage loading problems. We paid extra for a preferred seat were in row 18 at the bulkhead, seat location was good, seat itself was very narrow and uncomfortable. (extra seating probably means extra luggage and with the allowance of 2 checked bags per person might explain luggage loading problems.) Three hours after takeoff there was no service whatsoever, not even water. Then there was an announcement that Air Canada was implementing a new service, they were offering a hot towel service and the availability of both hot chocolate and sparkling in Economy Lass. A special representative was on board to explain this innovation and to hand out a 20 question survey on this startling innovation. Water and a meal service followed. The main was horrible, a tiny salad, a tiny bun and a Twinkie like desert. After a discussion with their service people water was offered more frequently. An attempt to order duty free on board failed, an attendant tried to help but was not able to place the order. The duty free cart came by when I was asleep so no success there.

a serious customer service problem,Dave Smardon,NotVerified,"  London Heathrow to Toronto with Air Canada. I am a million mile flyer so I have a lot of experience with traveling. I fail to understand why the baggage retrieval at Pearson Airport is consistently the worst I have experienced. Comparing Toronto with Paris, London, Zurich, Hong Kong, Vancouver, New York etc. etc. Typically, baggage at Toronto takes 30 to 50 minutes after having passed through customs and immigration. One wonders why the bags are not waiting for the passengers when they emerge from customs and immigration. At most other airports I have my baggage in no more that 20 minutes. In London, my bags are always on the carousel before I arrive. This continues to be an issue at Pearson (Air Canada) Terminal 1. I primarily fly Air Canada so my experience is with them. Frankly, I don’t care whether Air Canada blames Pearson management or whether Pearson blames Air Canada baggage handlers. This is a serious customer service problem that should be rectified. It is an embarrassment to Pearson and Air Canada both.

not a Comfort Class seat,F Deane,TripVerified,"  Biggest Air Canada fan waning after A220 inaugural Flight Experience. I purchased a Comfort Class ticket on the Air Canada inaugural A200-300 flight on January 16th between Montreal and Calgary. When I reached my seat, boarding in Zone 5 I found that my aisle seat was already being encroached on by a Plus Sized passenger who had moved the arm rests up as he could not fit the confines of his seat.  This was certainly not a Comfort Class seat experience from my perspective, although probably an Air Canada bargain at just over $500.  I thought Air Canada would put their topnotch flight attendants on this flight as it was an inaugural flight of a new aircraft type! Instead the economy cabin was blessed with 2 lack lustre crew members. I went to use the washroom at the back of the airplane and two service carts were blocking the access to the lav that was open while the 2 flight attendants were busy snacking and socializing. The male flight attendant later manned the Bistro Cart in the aisle offered the menu to me and I had to ask him if he had my prepaid voucher recorded on his manifest. He looked at a sheet of paper on his cart, then looked above at my seat row and number then offered the meal item and snack item. I chose for a meal item the mac n cheese which was one of the few hot items available. The flight attendant warned me that it would be at least 30 minutes because he would have to heat it up first. This, while the plane was over northern Ontario. I decided by the time we were flying over Saskatchewan, I would check on that 30 minute Mac and Cheese. I went to the rear galley and found a  female flight attendant freshening up her makeup and I asked her if she knew anything about the 30 minute Mac N Cheese I had ordered off the Bistro Cart and she opened the oven and found the cardboard box with the Mac N Cheese which was probably cooking for and hour and a half.

When we showed up at the airport however, with four pieces of luggage for the whole family, we had to pay 240 CHF additional per way.

We got no help from the Air Canada counter and we could not reach anyone on the phone after an hour of waiting.

Not good customer service,Sally Bonnell,NotVerified,"  London Heathrow to Ottawa. When a companies cabin crew apologises for their in-flight entertainment being really bad and in not a good working order for many passengers because the systems are so old, you would think an over haul would have been done: But you would have been mistaken! After three starts and reboots of the system followed by a discussion with ground staff as to how to fix the fact the entertainment system didn't work, the company resorted to 'vouchers' which required a passenger to log into Air Canada's website to be reimbursed! But oh no, don't think you will get anything back, you are.offered 15% off your next flight cost but you must fly within the year. So my question is, what about all those customers who, like me won't be flying again within the year as we saved for this holiday.

will avoid at all costs,Cesar A Carreno,NotVerified," Regina to Montreal via Toronto. What is described below is not a one-time occurrence, it has a rather disturbing high frequency on my travels. Paid for a more expensive flight to arrive earlier as I had an event. Wasted my money due to the delays. The departing flight (AC1114 from Regina to Toronto) was delayed due to ""additional flight preparation time"". The flight was then delayed two more times, to the point of missing my connection. To top it off, when consulting the departing gate to change the missed connection, was instructed to do so in Toronto. I made the big mistake of being nice to them and checked my carry on to assist them with space for other passengers. Big mistake as the whole Air Canada Toronto personnel that I consulted seemed to be trained to purposely do nothing to change a flight if baggage is checked. When requesting for an earlier flight, one of the people asked if I wanted to go on the next flight, to what I answer ""Yes!"" to then tell me he couldn't do it because of the checked luggage and telling me that he needed 1h and 15min for changing. Asked then for a flight apart 1.5 hrs, to what they say ""cannot do with checked luggage"". Do you notice the change of tone there? If this was a single occurrence, I would have said ""one time thing"" but this is the third time out of four flights I've got. Due to the frequency, I will avoid at all cost. I hope you do the same.

I’ve tried calling them myself on my cell phone however if you listen to the recording it literally says that they will not take your call because of their new reservation system. Please see photos showing how they have rebooked me with three additional flights going through another country and ending up at my destination two days later. This is totally unacceptable and I can’t even speak to someone to see if there are any alternatives which is why I am posting this review as I stay on hold. In addition, I went to three lines at the airport to try to get help and each person sent me somewhere else. I will never ever fly this airline again. It’s one thing to offer me a hotel in Toronto this evening but then to expect me to arrive in Korea and spend the night on a chair waiting for a flight is also unacceptable aside from all these time issues.

booking reference no longer existed,C Strumpher,TripVerified,"  I’ve spent the last month attempting to organize my itinerary. I waited a total of 6 hrs on hold for their customer service line. Each time they hung up on me (before I could speak) or an answering machine informed me they couldn't even put me on hold or take my call. I had to make multiple trips to the airport to ask questions that should be cleared online or over the phone, though they failed to give such options which were available in the past.

She kept saying “I don’t know. Can’t help you” even though she has the tools to look up my booking to see if there’s any issues on my end or hers. I had to ask her work colleague for help.

we had to switch planes,M Vardon,TripVerified,"  Calgary to Toronto. After boarding the plane we were told that we might have to switch planes due to that one needing repairs, so we had to wait another 15 minutes to find out, then the captain announced that we had to switch planes and that the next one would be there at 10:45. So I went to my next gate and the plane didn’t arrive until about 11:30. The captain and crew assured us that they were taking care of the connection issues, which may have been true for some people but not for me.  My in flight entertainment didn’t work and the charging ports didn’t work. I ended up just sleeping the whole flight anyway since I have flu.

When arrived in Pearson Terminal 3, an air Canada agent was waiting for me holding a plate with my name. She offered me a chauffeur service with a nice BMW 7 series to the terminal 1, from where my flight to Munich will depart. I was astonished as i am not a frequent flyer of Air Canada but just a star alliance gold member. The signature lounge of air Canada was amazing. Dining a la carte at the restaurant brilliant.

hire agents who actually care about helping passengers,Catherine Cheng,NotVerified,"  The flight from Taipei to Vancouver was decent. But it was hard to get comfortable in the seats in order to catch some sleep on the 10 hour journey. What made us most angry was our treatment at Vancouver airport while trying to catch our connecting flight back to Toronto. We had less than 2 hours to go through customs, get our baggage, then recheck baggage before boarding. Of course going through security was slow and on top of that, baggage claim had mechanical issues so we were delayed another 10 minutes. By the time we reached baggage drop off, the agent simply told us too late and that we missed our flight. No explanation or any effort whatsoever to reach out to the agents boarding for our flight. We got redirected to a check in area where we were then booked as standby for the next flight with the agent telling us that we would most likely get on. Now we understand seats are not guaranteed but at least have the agents be a little empathetic about our situation that was not our fault. Cue boarding time for the standby flight: the agent was rude and bluntly told all standbys that we were not getting on. Naturally people were upset and wanted answers. But this particular agent was so rude and yelled back at everyone to shut up as there was nothing she can do on her end. Funny, I thought these agents are supposed to provide customer service? Didn't know being yelled at and made to feel like missing our original flight was part of their job description. I can understand feeling attacked when you have angry customers all come at you, but that's part of your job to be able to keep your cool in these situations! After a bit of yelling back and forth, she rebooked us all as standbys for the last flight of the night with a small chance of boarding as this was yet another full flight. She couldn't or wouldn't tell us what our other options are if we were to be denied this last flight as well. So here we are waiting for the last flight hoping to get on while we're all upset with how we were just treated. Long story short, the flight crew was lovely but ground staff? Please hire agents who actually care about helping passengers who are stuck here. It's not like we all voluntarily decided to skip our original flights in favour of playing chance with the later flights. Worst customer service experience we've ever experienced. Would highly recommend avoid flying with Air Canada if you can.

I am extremely disappointed,E Molton,TripVerified," On Sat 30 November 2019, I was due to fly from London to Chicago, via Toronto. I successfully completed the London to Toronto leg of my journey. All of my problems began with the Toronto to Chicago leg of this journey (UA 7673 on 30 November 2019). I boarded the plane, but was then told that there was a fault with the plane. All passengers were told to disembark the plane. I expected to be booked on to another flight for that day, but was informed by Air Canada Staff at the gate that there would be no further flights that day. I was told to collect my luggage and leave the airport. I was given the Air Canada customer support phone number and was told to contact them to arrange an alternative flight. I tried calling this number continuously for the next 12 hours. I was unable to get through to a customer support agent, despite holding for up to 4 hours! I kept getting a message saying that I could not be placed on hold, with a request to call back later. The message did not change for the whole time I was ringing! When I checked my booking online, I could see that my YYZ to ORD had been rescheduled for 4 days later (Wednesday 3 December 2019). This was despite the fact that there were numerous seats available on Air Canada flights between Toronto and Chicago on the 1st and 2nd of December. As I was unable to contact Air Canada customer support to arrange an alternative flight, I had no choice but to make my own arrangements for travel to Chicago. I proceeded to book a flight from Buffalo NY to Toronto for Sunday morning 1 December 2019 at 7.15 am. I am extremely disappointed by Air Canada.

avoid using Aeroplan in the future,J Neale,TripVerified,"  I used Air Canada's reward system Aeroplan to book a flight and could only get a seat on a United flight. It went through the system including assigning a seat. However, it said it was unticketed. I waited 24 hours to see if the ticket was issued - and then spent hours trying to get through to both Air Canada and Aeroplan after United told me that I should contact them to put a priority on issuing the ticket ASAP because they would cancel the reservation if it is not issued soon. Both contact centres talk about changes to the reservation system and it is causing lots of problems - but this has been going on for weeks based on comments on various forums. And they point the blame on each other - despite one being bought out by the other. The lack of effort to add more staff and to extend Aeroplans hours is disgraceful and and both parties should be ashamed by their lack of acceptance that customer are paying the consequences of an ill planned change. After spending hours dialing to just get into the queue to talk to Air Canada or Aeroplan [I had two phones going at the same time]. I finally spoke to a human at Air Canada who refused to acknowledge any connection to Aeroplan tickets and basically said keep trying to connect. Honestly I spent over 5 hours continuously redialing the Aeroplan number which stopped working at midnight. I have less that 36 hours before I am suppose to fly and no ticket.

trying endlessly to retrieve our baggage,L Rhodes,TripVerified,"  Frankfurt to Nashville via Toronto. Our Frankfurt to Toronto leg was perfect. Staff was friendly, plane was comfortable, and flight was great. Once landing in Toronto, the chaos ensued. Our Nashville leg was cancelled due to weather (freezing rain and snow). Totally understandable. However, what wasn't understandable was the sheer incompetence of the Air Canada agents that helped customers. Once we arrived at the connections gate for the US flights, there was 1 Air Canada agent helping over 200 people that needed a flight rebooked. On top of that, they apparently had a new rebooking system, so she couldn't actually rebook anyone without having to wait on the phone with another department to see if anything was available. The first person in line took 2 hours to get resolved. I was fourth in line. Finally my husband and I received a hotel voucher after about 2.5 hours of waiting in the line. They stopped trying to rebook anyone and just immediately gave us a hotel. Then they told us we need to call their reservations hotline to get rebooked. No one would rebook us without calling this number and the hold times for that number were over 2 hours and longer with frequent disconnects. We were told to exit customs and go downstairs to baggage claim to collect our stuff and head to the hotel. We waited 8 hours for our baggage and it never came.  We spoke to baggage agents 7 times and had them call our specific bag tag numerous times over with no luck. One agent even showed us a picture of our baggage scanned into the warehouse and knew the exact cage number it was stored in, but no one would retrieve it for us. Baggage agents instead walked around telling people to wait for carousel 10 to have their bags (which was futile) or openly started arguing with customers. ""Have you seen the weather? It's out of our control! There are many people here waiting, you need to wait!"" I asked one agent if he could radio for a manager and he said he couldn't, that there was no way for him to get a manager, and that he could not help. The customer service was atrocious. We all knew that weather was not something they could not control, but the baggage operations are within their control and it was a complete and utter failure.  After being awake for over 24 hours and trying endlessly to retrieve our baggage, we had to give up. The next morning we ended up hiring a limo service to take us to Buffalo in order to rent a car to get to Nashville. We were never able to contact the rebooking department for help and no one in the airport could help us.

The experience was a major disappointment - the Air Canada premium product is far below the standard offered by other major carriers, including British Airways on the same route. Dinner was marginally better than economy class but wines were exactly the same as offered in economy. Breakfast was appalling - a slice of cake, a small yogurt and one cup of weak coffee. The food on BA is considerably better and they provide a hot breakfast. While the seat was more comfortable than in economy, it came with a flimsy pillow and a useless acrylic sheet that passed for a blanket. BA provides a quilted blanket.

no regard for their customers,Kyrus Ingalls,NotVerified,"  Worst experience with an airline. We flew from Montego Bay to Toronto Canada as a layover. As we boarded the plane the Captain advised that it was snowing in Canada, but we will be on time. As we arrived to the Toronto airport we spent a hour and a half on the runway. Due to traffic and the airline plowing. You would think they would of plowed ahead of time or at least prepped for snow. So are connecting flight was boarding in 20 minutes as we lay in wait on the runway. We checked Air Canada site and it stated that our connecting flight was delayed 2 hours. So my wife and I believed we had time to make the connecting flight being that we were sitting for our an hour on the runway. Well we were wrong not only didn’t they let people with connecting flights exit off plane first but the staff and the website lied about the delay. (The connecting flight was on time) As we approached the gate to our flight we were stopped and not allowed to enter US customs because they closed at 9pm. We arrived at the gate at 849pm and had time to walked 50 feet to customs. But not to our knowledge Air Canada already rebooked our flight for the following day for 920pm without advising us. The staff was rude and blamed it on US customs even after we told them we have 11 minutes. Then they advised that we couldn’t go through customs because our check bag was on our previous flight. We explained that they can send the bag at a later date because we have to get home to our kids. Note there are over 25 other people they denied as well. Also, other airlines sent our check bag at a later date of flights were running late. Furthermore, Air Canada did book our hotel rooms but did not state when we had to check out. So at 11am the next day we received a phone call that we have to check out. Our flight wasn’t due to arrive until 920pm. What were we supposed to do from 11am to at least 7 pm. With no winter clothes because we are coming from Jamaica and we didn’t have our clothes due to the checked bag being on the previous plane. We called several Air Canada customer service lines and we met with excuses. I will never fly Air Canada or will recommend this airline. We were warned but decided to try them out anyway. Lastly, my wife checked for flights and they had a flight leaving Toronto at 11am the next day but Air Canada boomed is on the last flight leaving because it was more convenient for them.

the ticket was pending payment,Melissa Roy,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Providenciales. This is the second time within a year that I have shown up to the airport in Toronto to check in for my flight to discover that the ticket I had booked through their app did not get paid. Last time I missed my flight entirely and Air Canada did nothing to rectify the situation telling me it was an issue with my bank. I ended up flying American. This time I once again arrived at the airport to check in, to discover I had to go to ticketing and purchase the ticket. At no point in either of these situations did I receive a notification that the ticket was pending payment, rather I received a reference number and 24 hours prior to my flight I began receiving check in notifications. This was the similar experience I had last flight. This time when I booked the flight I had my bank on the phone to ensure it wasn’t on their end. They confirmed it was not. Both times due to their issue I was inconvenienced and stressed about not being able to return home to my family in time. Air Canada charged me for my baggage and only offered up that it must be an issue with my bank. Unacceptable service and poor communication. Thankfully I was able to get on my flight this time.

The IFE was not going to be activated till after takeoff, and that meant that there would be no WiFi until the IFE was on. Then came a cockpit PA 'Attention passengers, this is your captain speaking. We will be delayed by 1 hour due to an accident on the apron.' That accident was a pushback truck that broke down, and they needed to move it. They couldn't turn on the IFE until at least one engine was on. One hour later we pushed back, and the IFE came on. I decided to check out the entertainment selection. As this was a 1:30 PM flight, lunch was served shortly after takeoff. My cheesy pasta was sufficient. After the meal, I checked the WiFi, and the prices were pretty reasonable. $29.78 for full flight of WiFi (that's 5 hours from LHR-YYZ).

The rest of the check-in and management staff on the ground though were all very nice and accommodating after I have to say. The flight was a 13,5 hours to Tokyo in a Boeing 787. Plane was nice enough and all the cabin crew staff were very good and welcoming. I was not expecting much for the food but this went beyond anything I had.

Air Canada flights were great,Carol Hathaway,NotVerified,"  We spend several months traveling this Summer and flew with a number of airlines, and Air Canada was the best, head and shoulders above others.

They have a stopover program, which allowed us to stopover in Toronto for no extra charge. The flight attendants, between them, spoke 7 languages. Where there were lines, the moved people with soon to be departing flight to the front of the line. Here is an example of how great the Air Canada people are.

most garbage experience,Edwin Del Rio,TripVerified," Montreal to Seattle. It all started with them making check my vest because it had studs and spikes. Then my flight was delayed a ton and they didn’t think it’d be an issue with me landing 5 minutes after boarding started on my connection. I brought this up to customer service multiple times and they just shrugged and dismissed it without any investigation or consideration. Once I arrived they canceled my connecting flight because they couldn’t transfer the luggage that I was forced to check on time. They scheduled me for a flight literally 24 hours later. I refused and asked for an alternate so they sent me to Vancouver and say they’ll have a hotel for me on arrival. I arrive at 11:30 and they have no clue about any hotel. I’m dealing with them for another hour before they get management to book a room. I don’t get to it till nearly 1:30 am. I leave wake up at 5:30 to get ready and catch my morning connection. While in immigration and customs line I get a text saying they canceled my connection and pushed me back to another flight 2 hours later. I called customer service and they just gave the same dismissive attitude. At this point, I’m running off of 4 hours of sleep and have missed all my work meetings for the day.

unpleasant and unprofessional,J Shipra ,NotVerified,"  I have been flying Air Canada - Toronto-Delhi-Toronto for the last 3 years (Premium Economy and Business), at least once a year. The service has been good and bad i.e. not really consistent but nothing so bad that it would motivate me to take time out to write a review. However, this time when I was flying direct to New Delhi from Toronto on Oct 8th, AC042, 22.10 departure, I had some experiences worth noting. Once we settled in the air hostess came to take our dinner order (choice between veg and non-veg). Coincidentally, my husband and I were the last 2 people she got to in a section of 22 passengers. Her words were: Unfortunately you will have to get the vegetarian option as that’s the only option left. We got a little irritated by her choice of words as we have paid the same fare as every other passenger in that section. So if every other passenger has been given a choice, why shouldn’t we be. And we expressed this with the air hostess. She said: “I will bring someone else to talk to you about it.” She then comes back after having a chat with her colleagues and said they’ll see what they can do about the meal. I am vegetarian so I would have chosen that option anyway. But just the way she said it was quite unprofessional. Over the span of the rest of the 13 hour flight, she was quite unpleasant and unprofessional whenever she would be serving us. She came to our seats to get our meal trays back but no thank you or a smile. Courtesies like these are basic tenats of any customer-facing industry, let alone airlines or hospitality which is quite a competitive market. Additionally, I rang the call bell once during my entire flight, and it took the staff 20 minutes and multiple times switching off and on to grab one of their attention. Even though they were walking up and down the aisle a couple of time. Maybe Air Canada needs to invest in training their staff on how to provide the best customer service that they claim in their advertising. Overall, it was quite disappointing for the fare prices we paid.",12th October 2019,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Toronto to New Delhi,October 2019,4,1,1,5,5,0,2,"['Toronto', 'New Delhi']",2,18.0,6,3.0,-0.6499999999999999,-0.058274711399711396,"['flying', 'last', 'years', 'premium', 'economy', 'business', 'least', 'year', 'service', 'good', 'bad', 'really', 'consistent', 'nothing', 'bad', 'motivate', 'take', 'time', 'write', 'review', 'time', 'flying', 'direct', 'new', 'oct', 'departure', 'experiences', 'worth', 'noting', 'settled', 'hostess', 'came', 'take', 'dinner', 'order', 'choice', 'veg', 'coincidentally', 'husband', 'last', 'people', 'section', 'passengers', 'words', 'unfortunately', 'vegetarian', 'option', 'option', 'left', 'little', 'irritated', 'choice', 'words', 'paid', 'fare', 'every', 'passenger', 'section', 'every', 'passenger', 'given', 'choice', 'expressed', 'hostess', 'bring', 'someone', 'else', 'talk', 'comes', 'back', 'chat', 'colleagues', 'see', 'meal', 'vegetarian', 'chosen', 'option', 'anyway', 'way', 'quite', 'unprofessional', 'span', 'rest', 'hour', 'quite', 'unpleasant', 'unprofessional', 'whenever', 'serving', 'came', 'seats', 'meal', 'trays', 'back', 'thank', 'smile', 'courtesies', 'like', 'basic', 'tenats', 'industry', 'let', 'alone', 'airlines', 'hospitality', 'quite', 'competitive', 'market', 'additionally', 'rang', 'call', 'bell', 'entire', 'took', 'staff', 'minutes', 'multiple', 'times', 'switching', 'grab', 'attention', 'though', 'walking', 'aisle', 'couple', 'time', 'maybe', 'needs', 'invest', 'training', 'staff', 'provide', 'best', 'customer', 'service', 'claim', 'advertising', 'overall', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'fare', 'prices', 'paid']","['unpleasant', 'unprofessional']",neg
hosts seem frustrated,B Geare,TripVerified,  Osaka to Vancouver. Air hosts seem frustrated and made us feel as if they were doing us a favour by having us on board. I’m not going to complain about seats and food because yes when you pay for economy you’re not expecting luxury. Even just making way on the aisle and the simple requests were not pleasant exchanges. The air conditioning was leaking on my seat and tissue had been stuffed into the vent to prevent this. After take off it stopped but when notifying the cabin crew there was an issue they just said we can’t do anything about it.

Air Canada assured me that my bag will be delivered to my address in Toronto but they never bothered to send my bag over from Dublin which meant that Aer Lingus, who I must say was one of the only reasons my bag was delivered to me, had to send my bag over.

All the staff at the airport were unfriendly and didn't want to help us until we called for the baggage manager who finally helped us with our case. When I finally received my bag, it was in a terrible state, there were multiple scratches and scuffs and the wheels were broken. I had no clothes, toiletries or anything for the 1st week in Toronto so I had to go out and buy new clothes and toiletries spending over $200.

checked bags were not free,M Durbin,TripVerified,"  We were a family of 4 (with young children, one with a freshly broken arm) flying 3 flights from London, ON - Toronto - Vancouver - Terrace, BC. Upon arriving at the airport we discovered that our supposedly 2 free checked bags were not free. We got the TD Aeroplan card  because we were told that the primary card holder gets a free checked bag, so my husband and I got them. No one told us that we only got them free if we booked with aeroplan points, which we didn't this time because we didn't have enough points yet. The Air Canada attendant who told us this information was not very friendly or polite, but I stayed super friendly with the lady the whole way through it all. The lady went and got sheets and pointed out the details. So we had no choice but to pay for the bags. If I had known in advance, we would of left a lot of our stuff at my parents home and only took what fit in our carry on. we would of brought that stuff later when flying home with West Jet where we get 1 free checked bag for myself and everyone else flying with me no matter how we pay for our flights. After paying someone told me that she had the authority to waive the bag fees if she wanted to. After this experience I did not want to fly Air Canada again. But on our last flight from Vancouver to Terrace which was delayed the attendants were amazing, they were full of smiles and super friendly even with all the stress they had of trying to get the plane ready for people who had been waiting a long time. They had great personalities and were great with all the kids on board. Because of them on the last flight, I might decided to fly Air Canada again, but at this point I will book future flights with WestJet where I get free 1st checked bags for myself and anyone flying with me no matter how I pay for my flights. Also I have never had an issue with their service with WestJet. I used to work in customer service and giving super great happy customer services was a big thing for me, so I expect the same when spending my money on service and products.

how I can get my bag back?,S Kayder,TripVerified,"  La Guardia to Dublin via Toronto. When I checked in to my flight, I already knew I would miss my connection with them so I asked them to make sure they do not lose my bags (the flight was delayed due to weather). When I reached my gate, I asked the agent to check my connection and she said I came too late to her because there are no more flights to my final destination the next two days. I have been delayed and missed my connection on many airlines but none were as disorganized as this. The first leg of my flight was New York to Toronto. In Toronto, my bag was already lost. I reached there 2 am and the lady did not file a claim when I told her my bag was lost and rather told me to return the next day to find it.The next day I returned to find it 4 hours before my next flight and they still did not find it in time for the bag to make my connection. They told me to file a claim when I reached my final destination but AC was very dismissive here at my final destination of Izmir in Turkey and did not allow me to file a claim with them. When I tried to file a claim online, I needed a incident report number, but since no one ever filed a claim for me, I never received an incident number. On the phone they were very unhelpful and rude. First of all I had to wait 21 minutes to even get an agent and then they told me to just file a ""lost and found item"".

had to wait hours in Toronto,V Stanikova,TripVerified,"  Prague to Toronto where I was supposed to continue on flight to Washington DC at 2pm. With me I only had a carry on luggage which I took with me on board. I was trying to find a place to store my luggage and one steward told me he will take care of it. That was really nice of him. Then he asked me if I had any important stuff in there, so I took my documents I had from school and he left with the luggage again. Then I learned my suitcase was checked in with the rest of the checked suitcases when they gave me the luggage number. So I told them that I’m going all the way to DC and they told me they have no idea if the suitcase is going all the way to DC or not and that I should ask some employees on the airport what is about to happen with the suitcase. I had no idea my suitcase is being checked in the plane storage. So there was nothing I could do about it afterwards. When I got out of the plane in Toronto I have asked about five people and every single one of the told me a different information. Nevertheless later they told me they lost the suitcase and couldn’t find it. And nobody was able to give me a proper information. All I was hearing was “I don’t know” and people there were not actually trying to help me, which is really frustrating when you’re supposed to catch a connecting flight which obviously I did not catch.

This is not an isolated incident,Kelsey Nicholson,NotVerified,"  I had an awful experience with Air Canada on my recent trip to Europe. Every single flight on my trip was delayed, but that was the least of my worries. On my way there, my bag was lost. I was unable to contact anyone who could give me any information as to where it was. When I received it nearly 3 days later it was severely damaged. On the way home I had even more troubles. Due to substantial delays, I missed my connecting flight in Montreal and had to stay there for an extra day before I could get another flight home. I was denied any compensation for a hotel room, cab fare, or food while I was stuck unexpectedly in Montreal for an extra day. They gave me a phone number to call to get a hotel room at a ""discounted rate"". However when I finally got through, I was told there were no more discounted rates left and the best they could offer me was a $300 room at the Marriott. No thanks. I booked my own hotel room for half the price on Expedia instead. When I finally got home the next day do you think my bag made it home too? Of course not! Once again it was delayed and further damaged. I have also been denied my claim for a refund of baggage fees, so I guess I paid $60+ each way for the privilege of having my bag lost and destroyed. It has been impossible to get ahold of an actual person to talk to about this nightmare of a trip, and all of my online claims have been denied. I have received $0 in compensation for any of this, even though I spent hundreds of extra dollars as a result of Air Canada's incompetence. My friends who were also flying Air Canada (different flights) to attend the same wedding all had similar troubles as well. This is not an isolated incident.

failed to provide meaningful compensation,S Dean,TripVerified,"  We booked and paid the higher prices for a direct flight taking 5.5 hours and departing early afternoon from Heathrow to St Johns, Newfoundland. Air Canada later cancelled the flight (for an appropriate reason), rescheduled us onto an indirect flight via Toronto taking over 13 hours and requiring a 4am departure from home with young children, but have failed to provide any meaningful compensation. E-mails to Customer Services (which have been the only way to contact them) have resulted in rude, unprofessional responses. We want to complain not only about compensation, but also about the attitude of Customer Services. However, they don’t seem to publish their Complaints Procedure anywhere.

I had an excellent flight,M Deane,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Vancouver. I had an excellent flight with Air Canada last week. The 777-LR with the pods and AC's Signature service is wonderful. The staff were attentive and friendly. I had the beef and the salad, dessert and cheese with a glass of wine were memorable. I flew on their latitude fare (which is full fare economy) and they gave me an up-grade from economy to a seat in the front cabin. My advice is if you fly several times a year fly with the same carrier or alliance because they notice and treat you like gold. One can look for a lower cost fare. However, as a tall guy I really appreciate the service and the big seat and it was very comfy. Also, the IFE was excellent. The AC wide body planes have an excellent number of choices and the front cabin has very large screens. I watched two films and hopefully when I fly AC again I can watch the other half of the third film I was watching.

remained unhelpful throughout,Catherine Spencer,TripVerified," We had a connection flight from Victoria to London that stopped in Vancouver, with only a 1h10min stop over which had been arranged by the airline through the Air Canada website - we are experienced flyers and had we been able to we would have booked ourselves on the 16:00h flight rather than the 18:00h flight that we ended up on. The first flight from Victoria was delayed by half an hour which mean that we had even less time to get between the flights and we knew Vancouver airport was rather large. The flight was then delayed again meaning that even though it was supposed to take off at 18:30 actually took off at 20:05, which was 5 mins before our next flight was supposed to take off. There were 16 other people on the same flight with us that were also told that they were going to try and get Vancouver to hold the flight for us as there were already many delays in Vancouver. However, the flight was not held for us and did in fact take off earlier than it was supposed to at 20:05. We missed the flight and expected some compensation as it meant that our entire journey had been delayed by a full day as the only flight they could get us on was for the evening after, and Air Canada did not even provide any hotels for us, despite them being the cause of a 24h delay. As well as this, we had paid money to be put in the preferred seating with extra legroom and when we brought this up while they were booking us on the next flight they were unable to do anything to help us. We understand that other people would have booked the same seats we did and they would be unable to change this, but even after several conversations with the customer ""service"" for the airline asking if they could possibly upgrade us to premium economy as we had paid for more room which we were now not getting, and been delayed by their incompetence, but they remained unhelpful throughout the whole process.

When I went to check in, and before the woman who was handling the desk I was going to use, could say anything, her next-door colleague announced in a loud voice that the flight had been cancelled. As the aircraft was to come from Halifax, some 2 hours away, someone should have told the computer to send me a message telling me that. This is where Air Canada customer handling came to the fore – come back at 20.30 and we will get you on that flight. I explained I had 3 more connections that day.

seatbelts don’t work with car seats,Lee Raphael,TripVerified,"  Los Angeles to Toronto. We booked 4 Business Class Seats on their Boeing 787 for a red eye flight. The tickets were for me, my wife, our 13-month daughter and our 14-year old niece. Air Canada booking showed the age of our daughter, as we gave them her info and said we wanted a seat for her. After we boarded, and put her in her car seat, she fell right asleep as people were still boarding.  At this point the crew said the car seat needed to be checked as their seatbelts don’t work with car seats, and I had to hold her. They also said there were no seats in coach for her and that they need me to get her now so that they could take off. They were polite, but I was stunned by what I was being told.  We complied with their instructions, as required. Air Canada responded to my email offering me a $100 e-gift card. All of us were exhausted after the flight. I’m insulted by their offer of $100 and simply can’t believe any airline would act in such a manner.

improved their long haul product,A Wong,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Hong Kong. A trip riddled with personal hiccups, but Air Canada managed to make it feel better. I was running a little late for my flight and in the heat of it all, left one of my carry-ons at a security checkpoint for domestic departures. While I wasn’t able to get the item back the ground staff and cabin crew went above and beyond their fall of duty in helping me get it back. It didn’t work out in the end, but I appreciate the effort from contact numbers to the flight attendant that literally stepped off the plane to help me look. They really didn’t have to, but I am very thankful for their efforts. As for the premium economy cabin itself, it’s very small, comprising of 3 rows, totalling 24 seats. They’re significantly wider than economy seats and closely resemble the regional business class product. The seats were comfortable and I managed to catch 6 hours of sleep on a 14 hour flight, but they a cosmetic refresh may be due, with slightly warped armrests and scratched glossy plastic seatbacks negatively impacting the aesthetics. IFE was touchscreen and remote controlled, though the touchscreen functions were somewhat unwieldy compared to economy class TVs. Food was above average, with a premium (though not business class worthy) first meal with proper porcelain and metal cutlery, followed by what seemed to be a standard economy class meal (I believe Cathay Pacific also does the same thing). They also have a chicken pesto ciabatta as a snack prior to landing and that was good too, chicken was tender and well seasoned. I would also note that typical of a North American airline, Air Canada does offer good coffee (Lavazza) even in regular economy, so that’s a plus. Overall, Air Canada has drastically improved their long haul product over the years, while maintaining fairly reasonable fares for international flights. As a full service airline, flying to Hong Kong, their most comparable competitor for the route is Cathay Pacific, of whom I have referenced regularly. Given a choice between the two, I would pick Air Canada for value, and surprisingly, food as well- they’re generally much cheaper and there seems to be better attention to detail with regards to food and beverage.

failure to address my emails,Steven Johnston,TripVerified,"  Edmonton to Charlotte via Toronto. It started with the grounding of the 737 Max 8 which lead to the first cancellation of my flights on March 15. This is understandable. I went online and changed all of my flights and my wife's flights and lost a day of travel but had everything sorted. I was now due to depart on the 16th. I got a call on the 15th from an agent saying my new flight was cancelled due to a schedule change. I questioned the reason ""schedule change"" as the agent didn't realize my wife was on the same plane and my wife's ticket was still good.  Everything got rebooked to have us routed through Vancouver and then overnighting now in Toronto and arriving the following day in Charlotte. When I arrived in Vancouver I got a text that my plane to Toronto was cancelled and I wasn't departing Vancouver until 11:55pm to Toronto with a 1 hour gap between my arrival and the flight to Charlotte. This was a problem as my luggage was all tagged to Toronto as I was supposed to be getting off and collecting my bags. I went to luggage services and arranged for the bags to all be redirected to Charlotte. I was assured this happened. When I arrived in Toronto I was met with the news that 2 out of 3 of my bags were not located. They almost did not let me board to the US with missing luggage but we finally got through with 4 minutes to spare and a very long run across the airport. I had to purchase new clothes as my bags were missing for three days. I finally got my bags but had to keep calling them to check on them and had to report the issue three different times as they failed to file a proper file number. I was never given the file number and I am now struggling to claim these charges. Due to the three flight cancellations I incurred charges for two missed hotel stays that couldn't be cancelled. We had a great time in Charlotte and on the last day I checked in online for my flight and it said to arrive at the airport 3 hours early for the international flight so we did. When we arrived at the airport there is only one Air Canada counter and there were no staff present to check our bags. We waited for 45 minutes after having the airport page them for someone to show up. When the agent finally showed up and we questioned why we have to be here three hours before our flight but she wasn't here, her response was ""My schedule says I start at 9 take it up with my boss"". There is a sign on the counter that says an agent will only be present 3 hours before flight departure times which clearly was not the case. I emailed air Canada customer service twice regarding these issues and the first response was a generic canned response addressing the grounding of the Max 8 737, which did not address my concerns.

48 hours in  Canadian airports,Kale Tyler,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Samana. After booking my honeymoon at a 5 star resort through air Canada vacations we proceeded to spend 48 hours in different Canadian airports with zero support, compensation or even apologies from the airline. Not only were we stranded on the first night of our marriage but when we were told in Edmonton that we would be taken care of for room and board in Montreal, where we were to wait until the following evening to fly, we were informed after landing that they hadn't arranged for enough rooms. As a result, my wife and I had to spend an additional 280$ on the only room left anywhere near the airport. As it was already very late at night we were only able to sleep for 5 hrs before we had to catch another plane backtracking to Toronto where we would continue our layover for another 10 hrs. The trip started at 7am on a Saturday and we ended up arriving in Dominican monday morning. After many attempts to talk to phone representatives, as suggested by all the management at the airports, we were able to convince them to leave us with 30$ food vouchers for 2 people and 48 hrs of travel! Anyone you talk to in this company has their hands tied and is very willing to hand you off to another person or direct you to another phone number where you wait on hold, once for 2.5 hrs, only to be redirected elsewhere so on and so forth.  At least we weren't fully out of pocket for our days spent at the airport, having paid with a WestJet credit card of all things.

lacks organization,Brian Albrecht,TripVerified,"  Columbus to Keflavik via Toronto. I've flown with Air Canada on this route twice. Once in 2017, and one scheduled for June 2019. The 2017 experience left me sour on Air Canada but I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt because, hey, stuff happens. I haven't even taken my flight yet in 2019 and I can tell you my 2017 experience was no fluke. Everything that has happened thus far points to a company that lacks organization and is terrible under crisis and doesn't know how to deal with anything that may not go exactly according to plan. I booked my flight in January 2019 and I've had 6 e-mails already about my flight being rescheduled and there being itinerary changes. I have never in my life experienced this much dysfunction when dealing with an airline. If everything goes smoothly, I'm sure you'll have a fine flight, but it's when things go awry that you hope an airline would know what they're doing, and in my experience, Air Canada just doesn't. There are other airlines that will charge $100 more for the same flight. It's worth it, if for no other reason than the peace of mind to know that if something goes wrong, things will have some modicum of organization and a plan.",6th March 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Keflavik via Toronto,March 2019,2,4,3,2,2,2,2,"['Columbus', 'Toronto']",2,17.0,7,2.4285714285714284,0.0,0.09027777777777778,"['keflavik', 'via', 'flown', 'route', 'twice', 'scheduled', 'june', 'experience', 'left', 'sour', 'thought', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'hey', 'stuff', 'happens', 'taken', 'yet', 'tell', 'experience', 'fluke', 'everything', 'happened', 'thus', 'far', 'points', 'company', 'lacks', 'organization', 'terrible', 'crisis', 'know', 'deal', 'anything', 'may', 'exactly', 'according', 'plan', 'booked', 'january', 'already', 'rescheduled', 'itinerary', 'changes', 'never', 'life', 'experienced', 'much', 'dysfunction', 'dealing', 'airline', 'everything', 'goes', 'smoothly', 'sure', 'fine', 'things', 'awry', 'hope', 'airline', 'know', 'experience', 'airlines', 'charge', 'worth', 'reason', 'peace', 'mind', 'know', 'something', 'goes', 'wrong', 'things', 'modicum', 'organization', 'plan']","['lacks', 'organization']",pos

Take any other airline,P Martin,TripVerified," Terrible! Take any other airline. I fly anywhere between 8-12 time’s per year, and when I fly Air Canada I consistently regret booking my flight with their airline. Firstly, their email and real-time updating on multiple of my flights has been inefficient. Our return flight was delayed by 2 hours and they sent an email to update on this information an hour before the flight departure. By this time we are already in line to go through security. We discovered that the cause for delay was because the flight crew had a mandatory rest time of 8hrs (and their previous flight had been late the night before) this means that the information on the flight delay had been known by Air Canada for at least 8 hours prior to the scheduled flight and they informed passengers only one hour before flight departure. In addition, our first flight to our vacation destination was also delayed and we received no updates on this until siting at the gate wondering why our flight hadn’t started boarding yet. To make matters worse, they did not prove to meet their revised departure time. We actually took off even later than the revised departure time. In both circumstances the email to update was not sent at a time that would allow us to make other plans to accommodate their lack of integrity. Secondly, I was not happy with the service on the aircraft. The stewardesses seem to have a lack of communication between their fellow employees. As they collected garbage I handed the stewardess a disposable coffee cup that had been used as a make shift garbage bin (full of banana peel and other garbage) she took the cup from me, then instead of throwing it away she proceeded to hand the cup back to me and said I will come back for liquids, and turned before I could explain there was no liquid in the cup. I felt uncomfortable because I was in the middle seat and this whole scenario happened while passing garbage back and forth in front of the passenger next to me (a stranger). To add further frustration, the stewardess did not return to take the garbage. When a different stuardess passed by I asked her to please take my garbage she responded in a rude tone “we already collected garbage”, I explained that the previous stewardess said she would return and had not, her reply was “I’ll come back then” She did end up coming back for the garbage, greeting me with “your garbage?” And then aggressively snatched the cup from my hand and stormed away. I felt humiliated and disrespected. This disappointing service has been consistent on multiple Air Canada flights, so often that I have come to expect this kind of service when I fly Air Canada. I have finally learned that flying Air Canada is not worth the frustration, confusion, and disrespect I encounter and will no longer consider flying with Air Canada in the future. I believe that there are much more details and events that Air Canada should be aware of if they are serious about improving their service.

offer good value and service,John Peters,TripVerified,"  Air Canada is really two airlines, a domestic one and an international one. On their international flights, they offer good value and service. The aircraft are new and well maintained and the service is very good. Notably, they have improved their food offerings over the past few years. The flight left HKG pretty much on time and I made my connection to Calgary. Inflight entertainment leaves something to be desired. The premium economy cabin is small, only three rows, and quite comfortable. Only one problem on the flight. We were not advised that passengers with connecting flights should claim their luggage. I recently flew through YVR from Paris and the bags went through to Calgary. However, there is a different policy with respect to flights from Asia, luggage is not automatically sent on to the final destination.

waste of time and money,Jessica Macmunn,NotVerified,"  Complete waste of time and money. My Husband and I planned a surprise getaway for our son for his birthday. Due to weather our departing flight was cancelled (understandably). The customer service from that point on was by far the worst experience we have witnessed. We were told that our flights would be rescheduled within an hour and they would notify us by email. The email link they sent was vague and we ended up calling and being left on hold for over an hour. when we finally reached an agent they advised that we could be re booked within 7 days! As we had car, hotel and attractions pre paid we requested an insurance claim but were told we had to deal with another department for this item. Eventually we were re booked the following morning but were flown out on 2 separate flights. My wife and son were flown to catch a connecting flight to our final destination while I was left on standby with a strong possibility of catching an afternoon flight. In total our 3 hr flights originally booked turned out to be a total of 30 hrs in travel time. While re booking I suggested other flights with air canada that were still posted as available on their website but they refused to allow us on these flights as they were a premium flight and not covered in their rebooking policy. All in all we missed our car rental (another long story) accrued extra hotel costs, additional car rental fees, and pretty much destroyed our holiday plans. To top everything off they lost our luggage on our return trip which thankfully arrived 2 days after we got home. To be clear, I dont blame the employees of this company as they are simply following the airlines rules. I blame a very poor business plan and management structure that is obviously designed to capitalize on any change of plan.

nothing wrong with this flight,B Callon,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Amsterdam. Essentially, there was nothing wrong with this flight, but it was not great. If it wasn't for the fact they were offering a terrific deal on a direct flight, I would have paid a bit more to travel with a European based airline. The service on a full flight was stressed. Frazzled is not quite the right word, but slightly chaotic and slow is probably a good description. Flight attendants were there to do their job, nothing more. Food was ok, standard fare, but warm and cooked well. I chose pasta with a tomato-based sauce. The seats felt a bit too cramped for a 7hr+ flight. Not a great recline either. A positive of Air Canada is that the full bar is available in economy class, something that makes a long-haul flight a little more enjoyable. On the ground though, they were really helpful. For this trip, I travelled with my wheelchair bound daughter. Often, we've found, any communication of her special needs onboard is not relayed to the airport staff. In this case, the staff at YYZ were ready to help and made sure she was properly helped on and had all she needed in place.

Awful service,Nishanto Pishon,TripVerified," Toronto to London. The most horrifying trip of my life! I will never be flying with Air Canada and will tell my friends and family to do the same. My flight was from Toronto to Dhaka via London and Delhi.; December 29th to January 19th I got my ticket early October with all seats selected and luggage insurance. Ticket was changed last minute with changed awful seats without permission and wouldn't allow to change it. On the day of the flight, it was delayed and I missed my connection. To which, Air Canada re routed me to a much longer flight with long delay. I also missed my domestic connection and even after repeated complaints, nothing was done about that. I was suggested to notify the agent about my luggage the next day, which I did. They still lost my luggage. I received my luggage 3 days later with no apology or refund as the insurance suggested. I was given the last seat in the middle row right beside the washroom (despite allocating the seat and booking it 3 months in advance). This was after I had explained and requested my situation. I boarded the flight from Dubai and right after they declared a delay due to ""technical difficulties"". I was starving and willing to even pay for some food; there were no flight attendants to be seen in this time. Flight reached delayed by another hour at Toronto and apparently there was no gate arrangement so we waited another half hour to 45 mins in the plane at the airport after landing. The luggage took forever to come: another hour and half! The flight was supposed to land 5:00 am, landed around 8:30 am and by the time I could get out of the airport it was 10:00 am.

always had some kind of hiccup,Jason Dutrisac,TripVerified,"  We have flown with Air Canada well over a dozen times in the past two years, every trip always had some kind of hiccup, mostly minor things for the most part, but our recent trip Jan 16th 2019 was the final straw for us.We were departing from Saint Louis flying to Toronto and then getting a connecting flight from there. While at the gate in Saint Louis waiting to depart, the captain announced that the plane is off balance and he needs to do some adjustments, so he makes the announcement that all women must sit at the front of the plane and the men must go to the back of the plane (safety first, no problem). Meanwhile all of this meant that we were 45 min late to depart Saint Louis, later on during the flight the captain announced that he realized that some of us had connecting flights and put our minds at ease by saying that the connecting flights would wait for us. Our flight from Toronto was to departure at 10:10pm, after sprinting through the airport we got to the gate at 10:05pm, the girl at the gate told us that she was told to release the plane. We then complained to customer service and they said 'oh well its not our fault it was the weather', and then he says to us : 'you guys should of had time to get through customs and make it here on time' we're in our 30's and we are in good shape, there was no way that even an Olympic runner wouldn't of made it on time! we continued to argue that the captain wouldn't take off because of the weight issue.

very upsetting to pay so much money,Balbir Sandhu,TripVerified," My elderly dad is old and has limited mobility. After careful consideration, I decided to pay the extra money to upgrade him and I to premium economy on our return trip from India to Canada. When we checked in our luggage, the Air Canada attendant only marked two of the luggages as priory and not the other two. When we arrived to Canada, we got two of our luggages right away and the other two we waited 1.5 hours for. There are only a few perks for paying so much more money to upgrade to premium economy and having gotten our luggage right away would have been very nice. My father was struggling with the waiting. I complained to Air Canada and they offered me 15% off on my next ticket purchase and this offer expires in a year. I am not going to be doing any travelling for the next year due to having surgery and work commitments. I asked Air Canada for a bigger discount (because I purchased two premium tickets) and a longer expiry date so that I can actually make use of their goodwill gesture. Air Canada came back saying that was the best they can do. Of course they can to better than that. They just chose not to.

Outgoing packed a medium size carry-on in case checked luggage does not arrive with me. Turns out this precaution was totally not needed. Air Canada was wonderful. Ground staff were friendly, and importantly, were intelligent and understood passengers' questions. On all 4 flight sectors, service was efficient. On all flights but the last, FAs were cheerful and went about their tasks with a smile. Food was mediocre, but, really, who realistically expects fine dining in economy? Plenty of liquids and juices on board. Legroom was okay. Had an aisle seat for sectors 2 and 3, and middle-guy and window-guy could easily slip by without my having to stand up. All flights on time. Thank you, AC. Where have you been all my life?

get rid of their new baggage fees,M Charson,TripVerified,"  I flew from Toronto to Geneva (with a stop in Montreal) on an A330 and returned to Toronto from London Heathrow on a Boeing 787-9. Air Canada has changed its economy class setup and now charges $60 each way to check in a suitcase on long-haul flights. This is by far my biggest gripe - one of the main reasons I choose to fly Air Canada is that the fare used to include all the essentials, unlike many of their competitors. Sadly, AC are starting to go down the nickle-and-diming route. Surely everybody who goes on a long transatlantic flight needs to check in a suitcase, so why not just include it in the airfare like before and spare everyone the hassle? This makes the online check-in process much longer and more cumbersome, as billing address and credit card info. all have to be entered as well as everything else. Very annoying and pesky. You also no longer get to choose a seat at the time of booking and instead have to wait to see what's available when checking in, though I wasn't too annoyed about that. Bag-drop at Toronto Pearson was fully self-service - I was even able to place the suitcase on the belt myself without any staff being present. The flight to Montreal and then on to Geneva was on time. Unlike on many newer aircraft, the older A330 has the advantage of having nice wide seats with excellent legroom and good seat cushioning. The IFE was okay but not quite as good in the newer cabins. Unfortunately I was seated in the middle of the aircraft by the washrooms, which was very bothersome on an overnight flight. The stopover in Montreal is a curious setup as I had to get off the plane, wait at the gate, and then get back on it into the same seat about 1.5 hours later. The cabin service was usual Air Canada - generous with the drinks, less so with the food. The pre-landing snack of a small slice of banana bread was inadequate. The return flight on the very new 787-9 was pleasant - the seats were not as narrow or as firm as I feared they might be. The IFE was better than on the older A330, though still not as good as some other airlines'. Cabin service was the usual - pleasant enough. On both flights, the captain and first officer stood with the cabin crew to say goodbye as passengers disembarked, which I thought was a very nice little touch. Arrival at Toronto Pearson airport was the usual complete disaster - we had to sit for over an hour until a gate opened up, and then they couldn't get the bridge to fit properly. And the usual pandemonium at the baggage reclaim, but none of this was AC's fault. Overall, perfectly pleasant flights and very glad that AC has finally got rid of their ancient 767s! I just wish they would quickly get rid of their new baggage fees for long-haul flights.",8th January 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Geneva via Montreal,January 2019,4,4,3,4,3,0,4,"['Toronto', 'Geneva']",2,22.0,6,3.6666666666666665,0.13636363636363635,0.16088555041944874,"['flew', 'stop', 'montreal', 'returned', 'heathrow', 'boeing', 'changed', 'economy', 'class', 'setup', 'charges', 'way', 'check', 'suitcase', 'far', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'main', 'reasons', 'choose', 'fly', 'fare', 'used', 'include', 'essentials', 'unlike', 'many', 'competitors', 'sadly', 'ac', 'starting', 'route', 'surely', 'everybody', 'goes', 'long', 'transatlantic', 'needs', 'check', 'suitcase', 'include', 'airfare', 'like', 'spare', 'everyone', 'hassle', 'makes', 'online', 'process', 'much', 'longer', 'cumbersome', 'billing', 'address', 'credit', 'card', 'info', 'entered', 'well', 'everything', 'else', 'annoying', 'pesky', 'longer', 'choose', 'seat', 'time', 'booking', 'instead', 'wait', 'see', 'available', 'checking', 'though', 'annoyed', 'pearson', 'fully', 'able', 'place', 'suitcase', 'belt', 'staff', 'present', 'montreal', 'time', 'unlike', 'many', 'newer', 'aircraft', 'older', 'advantage', 'nice', 'wide', 'seats', 'excellent', 'legroom', 'good', 'seat', 'cushioning', 'ife', 'okay', 'quite', 'good', 'newer', 'cabins', 'unfortunately', 'seated', 'middle', 'aircraft', 'washrooms', 'bothersome', 'overnight', 'stopover', 'montreal', 'curious', 'setup', 'plane', 'wait', 'gate', 'back', 'seat', 'hours', 'later', 'cabin', 'service', 'usual', 'generous', 'drinks', 'less', 'food', 'snack', 'small', 'slice', 'banana', 'bread', 'inadequate', 'return', 'new', 'pleasant', 'seats', 'narrow', 'firm', 'feared', 'might', 'ife', 'better', 'older', 'though', 'still', 'good', 'airlines', 'cabin', 'service', 'usual', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'captain', 'first', 'officer', 'stood', 'cabin', 'crew', 'goodbye', 'passengers', 'disembarked', 'thought', 'nice', 'little', 'touch', 'arrival', 'pearson', 'airport', 'usual', 'complete', 'disaster', 'sit', 'hour', 'gate', 'opened', 'bridge', 'fit', 'properly', 'usual', 'pandemonium', 'baggage', 'reclaim', 'none', 'ac', 'fault', 'overall', 'perfectly', 'pleasant', 'glad', 'ac', 'finally', 'rid', 'ancient', 'wish', 'quickly', 'rid', 'new', 'baggage', 'fees']","['rid', 'new', 'baggage', 'fees']",pos
was an excellent flight,D Leare,TripVerified,"  Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver. This was an excellent flight in a brand new 737Max. Upon boarding staff were cheerful and helpful. The seating was roomy and was in the front row window seat as it is easier to get in and out around the passenger beside me. The IFE has much larger screens and more selections than the other AC narrow body planes. I really appreciated that. The attendant serving us in the front cabin was attentive with the wine and beverage service. As I fly AC a lot I noticed that dinner service had fewer choices and it was not served as courses nor were there 2 linens on the tray. Given this was a flight to a beach destination and I bought the return ticket at a very reasonable price, I can understand you would not get the same level of meal services I experience when traveling to Toronto, Montreal or Europe. One disappointment is the size of the forward rest room...thankfully I am a tall slim person. It would feel very cramped for some others. Also missing was the hand and face lotion that one typically finds in business class. This I missed as the air is so dry. I would appreciate it if AC would add that to the business class rest rooms on the 737Max. Check in was smooth and well organized. There is no lounge at PVR for front cabin passengers. The flight left on time and arrived early. I will be returning to Mexico on the same type of plane in the front cabin and look forward to the trip.

No food provided,W Lagorski,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Toronto. No food provided, not even a pretzel! Extra charges for every piece of luggage checked in. All 3 flight during my one week vacation were delayed (4 hours the first one) The planes don't have enough in-cabin space to accommodate traveler's belongings. I had to check in my carry-on in the end. Service was about the worst I have ever experienced. Service was interrupted at one occasion due to turbulence, I asked for a coffee but since they could not serve hot beverages during that moment the flight attendant gave me an empty cup so that I can claim my coffee when the seat belt sign went off. Waited an hour for them to come see me (that little light to call assistance is useless on that flight because they ignore you). Once she came back, took my cup and that was the end of it.

absolutely appalling,S Healey,TripVerified,"  St. John's to Boston via Halifax. The original flight out of St John's left 1.5 hours after scheduled departure although the status was not delayed and we boarded reasonably on time. Landed in Halifax and got back onto the same plane to go to Boston after clearing US customs. Got to Boston and my bag had not made it out of Halifax although both of my husband's bags made it. We filed a delayed baggage report with the Air Canada baggage office in Boston on 1 Jan 2019 - same day as our flight. We flew on to Las Vegas and were informed that the bag would be routed to us within 2 days. It is now day 4 on the 4 Jan 2019 and we still have no bag. We have spoken to at least ten different people on the phone number provided for Air Canada delayed baggage. Turns out we are dealing with a call centre where there are no clear lines of communication as we have now been told about five different versions of where my bag is. We decided to get in a cab and go to Las Vegas airport to see if we could find out more information. Air Canada have a shared baggage office managed by a different company. They told us the bag was no in Toronto and most definitely not arrived in Vegas on 3 Jan 2019 when it was supposed to reach us. We called the delayed baggage number again and actually ended up giving the phone to one of the staff at the office because the guy on the phone was adamant our bag arrived in Vegas - turns out he was wrong. We are due to fly home to Australia on 4 Jan 2019 so gave numerous instructions to now get the bag to our home address - we verified that this information was on my file reference on the World Tracer website - great we can see the information on there, my bag might get home! Oh wait we just called Air Canada delayed baggage hotline and have been informed it is now going back to Boston from Toronto and is not scheduled further than that. Now we have already told these people numerous times we don't live in Boston. So after giving clear instructions again for at least the fifth time that the bag needs to now get to Australia, we are still in limbo. It is impossible to actually speak to someone directly at Air Canada because they have made themselves fantastic at being unreachable - no email addresses or phone contact numbers. The delayed baggage call centre cannot communicate accurate information and don't know anything but those are the only people you can speak to. We fly regularly every year and have used many different airlines. Never have I experienced anything like this. The customer service and assistance at Air Canada is absolutely appalling and I am astounded that an airline can operate like this. By the way Air Canada, I am still waiting for my bag.

have nothing but good things to say,Robert Pierce,TripVerified," This is my fourth or fifth trip with Air Canada and I have nothing but good things to say about my experiences. The terminal used for Canadian domestic flights at Vancouver is quite dated, but plenty of options for eating and drinking while waiting for the flight. Volunteers were requested to check carry-on bags (something I always count on happening, as my carry on tends to be quite heavy, always a treat). Boarding was expeditious considering the size of the aircraft, and we were soon on our way. Food and beverage service was an average pace and quality. Buy on board options were quite pricey, so I abstained. On their newer aircraft, AC's inflight entertainment is some of the best in the industry. Arrival into Toronto was early and the flight time overall was one hour quicker than scheduled! Connection in Toronto is always such a breeze, and USA pre-clearance in Toronto means you arrive into the USA without a need for passport control. Toronto to Boston was a standard North American flight of fine quality. Air Canada's gates in Boston are right next to baggage claim and the exit.

worst traveling experience,Stella Smolkin,NotVerified,"  My husband and I had booked a flight AC85 from Tel Aviv to Toronto, on November 24. We had a connecting flight from Toronto to Newark (flight number AC7654), which was supposed to depart at 18:40 on November 24. The flight from Tel Aviv was delayed by over an hour; however, the pilot did his best to get us to our destination as soon as possible. As a result, we arrived at the Toronto Airport with an hour to spare before our next flight. We arrived at our gate at approximately 18:10, the boarding time. However Air Canada notified us that we weren't permitted to board the plane because our plane was late, and they didn't have enough time to store our luggage. Despite telling her that they could've sent the luggage to us the next day, she persisted that we weren't allowed to board, and gave us a pamphlet, ""Interrupted Trip Information"", a hotel reservation for the night, $15.00 each for dinner at a restaurant, and tickets to Newark for the next day. Afterwards it was brought to our knowledge that the flight was overbooked, which may be the reason for us giving up our seats on the original flight. We then had to fly to Montreal, and then to Newark. Consequently, instead of arriving at Newark at 20:00 on Saturday, we arrived at Newark at 16:30 on Sunday.

the food is poor,W Cooper,TripVerified," My Air Canada flight left Hong Kong at 20.00. A meal was served shortly after take off. It was so bad I left almost all of it. If I'd had any idea that would be the case, I would have brought something on board. Talk about stale, you couldn't even get a fork through the dessert cake. Surely someone should be checking the quality of the food. To add to my disappointment, there was only one opportunity for a beverage. I would have dearly enjoyed a second glass of wine, but it was not an option. Clearly, either a tea totalling crew or that's the new limit. There was not an option of a snack or non-alcoholic beverage. Shortly before landing, we were served breakfast. I can't remember exactly what it was, but again, it was not good and the bun was so stale, I couldn't even tear it open with my fingers. Why even serve bread that must be a month old? Doesn't anyone do a quality check? The entertainment options were poor. Most movies were old. I think there might have been only a couple of current films offered. Seating was fine, but given the upcharge to fly premium economy it was not worth it. I've flown long-haul flights with Air Canada before, sometimes business class, sometimes economy.

they can't let me board,Yan Guo,TripVerified,"  St John to Los Angeles via Toronto. The first flight scheduled to depart at 5:00am. However, it was delayed by 30 minutes. The weather was OK. I arrived Toronto around 7:00am local time. My next flight to LAX is at 8am. I ran all the way through security, US border and arrived gate F69 at 7:40am. Then the gate lady told me my bag is not delivered yet and they can't let me board. I then ran to the customer service of Air Canada. I asked them what option I have now and I told them that I have to arrive LA before noon. The two senior ladies were helpful. They were trying to find flights to SF or San Diego. However, the third lady denied each proposal. The flight to SD would be OK for me because I can rent a car and drive up to LA for the appointment. However, they were all denied by the other agent. The senior lady issued a $15 meal voucher to me but I was furious after the agent asked me to go away otherwise she will rip off the voucher.  I have to accept the next flight which is 4 hours later. When I booked the ticket, why the itinerary designed for only 1.5 hour transfer if the bag transfer is so inefficient? What about the boarded passengers with transfer flights?

made so many mistakes,Sheldon Banta,TripVerified,  My original flight would have taken me from Dallas to Montreal to Vancouver to Melbourne. My problems started when I was not allowed to place my bag into an overhead compartment on my first flight leaving from Dallas because of a lack of available space. After checking my bag at the gate and boarding the plane I observed a flight attendant access her belongings which had been conveniently placed in an overhead compartment inside the passenger area of the aircraft. My next flight leaving Montreal was delayed 90 minutes due to engine problems which forced me to miss my connection in Vancouver. I was then rebooked on a flight to Sydney which was delayed for 60 minutes. When boarding the plane in Vancouver I noticed I had not been placed in a seat with upgraded leg room which I had paid for months before. When I inquired as to why I was not in a seat with more legroom I was told the flight was full and there was nothing that could be done. Upon arriving in Sydney I was met by an employee who advised I would be unable to make my connection flight from Sydney to Melbourne and handed a new ticket for a different flight. While in Sydney I found out that my luggage was still in Vancouver. I did not receive my luggage for 48 hours. After boarding my first flight leaving Melbourne there was a power issue forcing us to be grounded for just over an hour. This caused me to again miss my connection in Vancouver and Air Canada wanted to rebook myself and other passengers on another Air Canada flight. The problem with that was our original flight was from Vancouver to Dallas and they now wanted to rebook us on other non direct flights. After voicing my concerns I was booked onto an American Airlines flight in order to fly directly from Vancouver back to Dallas. Upon returning to Dallas I was again informed that my luggage did not make it to the new plane and was still in Vancouver. I filed a complaint online on November 18th after all the problems arrived getting to Australia. I contacted customer service since customer relations does not have a phone number on November 22 to check on the status of my complaint. I was informed by customer service that there was no way for me to speak with someone over the phone in customer relations and my complaint could take up to 40 days to be investigated. I’m confused as to how this air lines could have made so many mistakes in such a short amount of time on every single one of my flights.

Staff was very attentive,T Darseno,TripVerified,"  Detroit to Rome via Toronto / Montreal. Transatlantic trip made by three segments. All flights pretty much on time, with easy boarding processes. DTW YYZ is a regional jet, hence, other than light refreshments and a squeezed seat, nothing much is to expected. Transit within AC’s T1 at YYZ was easy and smooth. YYZ YUL on 320 with PTVs (although the audio jack was not working at all). First time going through YUL and I expected to be much larger than that, probably on the same scale as YYZ. Easy boarding in Premium Economy (priority lane) makes settling in easy. Premium Economy seating is better than competitors (LH) with larger recline. Overall very satisfied. Good value for the money, as I bought a DTW FCO ticket for $ 560.00 and then paid $ 295.00 each way for the PE upgrade through bidding: I could have paid additional $ 600.00 each way and flown business.

delayed and ultimately cancelled,B Neale,TripVerified,"  Toronto to New York. My flight was delayed and ultimately cancelled due to aground stop issues because of weather concerns. Obviously the weather delays are outside of Air Canada's control; however after waiting on the aircraft for several hours, we finally reached the delayed departure time when the ground stop was lifted and we should have been able to take off. It wasn't until this point that we were informed that the crew would go over their time limit if they continued this trip and that instead of heading to LGA we had to wait for a new crew. This is unexcusable as we had known about the ground stop for hours and Air Canada should have had the foresight to address this issue and switch the crew while we were waiting for the weather delay anyway. While waiting for the crew to switch we miss our window of opportunity as a new weather-related ground stop was issued and the flight was ultimately cancelled (meanwhile other airlines and aircraft had departed and made it to LGA during this time, as we should have). To add insult to injury, when Air Canada rescheduled my itinerary, they placed me on a new flight that was scheduled to depart YYZ on the 17th to make up for my cancelled flight that was supposed to leave on the 15th. However they did not rebook my originally scheduled return flight on the 16th so that my new itinerary scheduled a return flight before I even departed for my destination. When I first contacted Air Canada to correct this obvious problem, I was almost charged a rebooking fee to reschedule my return flight.

Not worth the upgrade,G Shearer,TripVerified,"  Pittsburgh to Frankfurt via Montreal. Not worth the upgrade. Premium Economy food horrible. Cold, rubbery chicken-ish thigh meat with stale cold rolls. Broken inflight entertainment at several passengers seats nearby including mine. Flight attendant barred passengers from using a bathroom directly in the cabin due to no apparent reason other than wanting her own privacy in the area between 1st class and premium. She forced passengers to 'go to the back of the plane' where lines and economy passengers were already overwhelming capacity of the available 2 commodes. Transit in Canadas major cities in my back/forth experience added agitation and chaos and was remarkably coldly delivered. Many missed their flights back to the U.S. on the return from Europe due to the lengthy custom points In Montreal and Toronto.

rerouted to a direct flight,F Barker,NotVerified,"  I had a conference to attend in Toronto. I was flying United and my itinerary was to fly from Hong Kong via San Francisco and then Chicago to Toronto. My United Airlines flight from Hong Kong was late to take off for over an hour and I only had an hour 25 minutes transit time. When I cleared the customs, rechecked my luggage, and ran to the gate, it was closed. After working through issues and arrival time, I was rerouted to take a direct flight from San Francisco to Toronto on Air Canada. This was my first experience with Air Canada and didn’t know what to expect. I went to the gate 45 minutes before the flight time, no one was even at the counter. The ground crew showed up around 25 minutes and didn’t start boarding until 10 minutes prior to the departure time.  I immediately asked a flight attendant to fill my empty water bottle after boarding. I then found out how smart the move was. First, this 5-hour trans-border flight included no drinks (not bottled water and you had to ask before they would give you water) or food. The flight attendants’ main duty was to sell earbuds, snacks, and drinks to each customer. Thus, it took them 3 hours to reach the last row where I was. Another issue was that they sold some kind of hot snack. One of the flight attendants walked by me numerous times loudly to do heating. They did not go to the next row until the ordered food was given to the paying customer. The interior of this plane was worn with rather uncomfortable seats and entertainment programs were ancient with mostly Canadian shows.

used to be much more reliable,M Hayton,TripVerified,"  I flew Air Canada from Heathrow to Toronto, arriving only to find that my suitcase did not arrive with me. When I lined up to report that it was missing, I found that other passengers had the same issues, with the same airline, and had come from various other destinations. One woman I spoke with had connected with my flight from Zurich, had sufficient layover / connection time, and yet her luggage also did not arrive. Passengers pay handsomely for flights. We comply with the airline stipulations regarding luggage. Is it so much to ask that our luggage actually gets on the same flight that we are on? In my case, when I was reporting it having not arrived (at @ 9:20 pm Oct 2nd in Toronto), I was told it was still at Heathrow.  In this day and age of much improved technologies, systems, communications is it so much to ask for your luggage to be put on the same flight that you are taking so that you are not inconvenienced? It seems to me that Air Canada has increased its arbitrary decision making about whether or not to send luggage on the same flight as passengers. Is it any wonder that passengers are increasingly taking bags stuffed full, and often overstuffed, right onto the plane with them? This practice of not bothering to load luggage onto the same plane as the passenger is on is not acceptable. There is no excuse.  Air Canada used to be a much more reliable airline than it is now. Even the meal offerings on board have become substandard.

have had no response at all,Linda du Toit,TripVerified,"  Victoria to Milan via Toronto. My flight left really late from Victoria and as a result my bags did not arrive with me in Milan. I was only there for 7 days, and staying at a villa in a really small town on Lake Como. Three of the people on vacation with me did not receive their luggage. The person handling the delivery was rude and would not speak English. One of us had to wait at the villa every day until all the bags arrived, because there was no reception and no one to receive the bags. Our bags arrived on the 3rd, fourth and fifth day of our stay. I have entered a claim, but have not even received a confirmation that the claim was received. On my return, the flight was again delayed in Toronto for over an hour. Many had connecting flights that were missed. We were given a hotel voucher on arrival, and also explicitly told that our bags were being taken off the flight and we were to pick them up and re-check them the next morning. The bags were not taken off and by the time I reached the hotel is was already 12:40 pm When I reached the hotel, I was told that it had been overbooked and that there was no room for me. I had to return to the airport where there was only one poor attendant dealing with all the many issues with Air Canada. Two of us had nowhere to stay. The airline only pays $150 for a hotel room, and there are none at that price near the airport, and they were all full. He finally found us a hotel, but we had to pay for it ourselves and were told to claim the $150 from the airline. My flight the next day left early so I only slept for 4 hours. I have also entered a claim, and written two complaints to the airline, and I have had no response at all, apart from an automated email saying they had received my message it is was 'in good hands'.

state of their customer service,L Satoun,TripVerified,"  Calgary to Ft McMurray. Air Canada in flight services and reliability is typically decent. I fly with them a fair bit. What I am reviewing today is the state of their customer service. Firstly, I should mention that, at the best of time, reaching them to modify a flight requires 20 mins of waiting over the phone unless you have the altitude member number (35K and over I understand).  But what I am writing to flag and rant about today is how difficult my last experience trying to obtain a justification of payment has been.

chaotic gate experience,T Eldem,TripVerified,  Brussels to Montreal on Air Canada. Our trip originated in Prague with the first leg operated by Brussels Airlines so upon landing in Brussels we proceeded to the lounge. AC uses Brussels Airlines lounge which was very crowded and had very limited food and drink options. We proceeded to the gate 30 minutes before boarding time and were met with a long queue for passport verification. When I went up to the counter to inquire if there were a separate line for business class passengers the agent simply responded by saying there was only one line and pointed to the back of it. We had somewhere in the neighbourhood of 150 passengers ahead of us and there were only two ground agents performing the checks. After 20 minutes in the line I went up again and asked why they did not have a dedicated line for premium passengers like they do at every other European airport. In a rather sarcastic tone the agent simply said “this is how we do it in Brussels”. We finally got through the line at which time I spotted the AC Concierge and immediately questioned him about the process only to be told that they do have a dedicated line for premium passengers. At this point I was getting quite agitated and asked him why it was not in effect that day. To that he simply said he did not know. We then went into the priority boarding line which was a joke as there had to be 100 people in the line. Finally the agents announced start of boarding but instead called for those in zones 3 and 4 ahead of the priority passengers. At this point the boarding became a free for all and resembled those you would see in third world airports. On board the service was great but the hard product was showing its age. Food was quite tasty but they had no red wine as they simply had not loaded enough on the inbound trip from Montreal. IFE has a reasonable selection and before landing we were served another meal which was also very tasty.

seat I did not fit into,Nick Savino,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Rome. Flight was delayed and we specifically paid an extra 400 for premium seats and we spoke to the Air Canada Agent in reservations to make sure we had the correct seats on both legs of the journey since I had heart surgery and am a big man who needed the extra leg room and ability to raise the arm rests for more room. I was assigned a seat I did not fit into because the arm rests would not go up on this premium seat. The plane was full and no other seats could be given. My mother also had a seat whose arm rests would not go up but being smaller it was not an issue for her even though these were premium seats. On our return flight from Rome to Toronto we paid 300 for premium seats (total 700 for both legs wife came back on an earlier flight) and when we boarded the plane our seats had been given away and the premium seats we paid for two months earlier were not available. We were in row 45 which was the last row in Zone 3 with very little leg room. I had to take the middle seat since the window was too tight for me and the arm rest in the aisle would not go up. The flight attendant said there was definitely an error on the seats assigned and she made me follow her to the gate agent to see if anything could be done. The agent said all seats were full and there was nothing she could do. The plane was ready to depart so I took my seat and suffered on the 10 hour flight back. At the airport in Toronto there was no one to speak to regarding a refund and our experience with Air Canada as well as my medical issues and my mother being abandoned in Rome on her own in a wheelchair. I was told to call a number which was an office in Calgary that would need a letter mailed to them regarding the issues I experienced. I was also told to google a customer care website where I filled out the online forms for both my medical and my refund for the premium charges.  We specifically booked through Air Canada direct so we would be able to avoid any issues with other airlines or agencies and could deal with AC directly but it has been a nightmare trying to have anyone reach out to us or resolve our issues before, during and after the flight. Again today I have once again resubmitted our request for refund and am currently waiting.

not even an apology,S Thaylin,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Edmonton.  As I waiting for the flight at the gate, I heard a call for 4 volunteers who are able to take the next flight. The announcement also said those who volunteer will get a $400 cheque. I was the 2nd volunteer who went up to the female attendant at the gate and she dealt with all the paperwork and informed me that I was booked for the midnight flight. So, as per my previous plans I originally arranged for my parents to pick me up at the airport. As I took the next flight and was confirmed by the attendant, I informed about the change in time for my pick up. I was told by the attendant at the gate that I would get the $400 and my boarding pass after all passengers had boarded. After a while when everyone had boarded, I heard my name being called to the gate. I went up and talked to the other male attendant. He quickly asked for my ID and gave me a boarding pass and I was rushed to board the original flight. I was very confused and stressed with the sudden changes to the plan as I thought I was already confirmed and scheduled for the next flight. As I boarded the plane, I was told to quickly load my carry on in the front overhead compartments and I took my seat as per the boarding pass. The plane started to take off as soon as I was seated so I did not have enough time to contact my parents about the changes. When I landed in Edmonton, I tried my best to call my parents again but they had already went to bed in order to wake up at midnight to pick me up as per my previous conversation. I did not have any other options other than waiting at the airport until 2:00 AM when they finally came to pick me up. Overall, I was very dissatisfied with the service and the lack of understanding I received from the attendants. This is also only second time travelling so I was very scared and nervous about the whole situation. I called the customer service today about receiving the $400 cheque that I was originally promised but they told me I was suppose to receive it at the airport.

still waiting for my bag,John Apuzzo,TripVerified,"  I have flown Air Canada many times and was generally satisfied with their service, yet my last trip was less than to be desired.  My flight from Paris to Toronto was delayed by more than 5 hours. The company stated the cargo door was broken when unloading merchandise. When we finally boarded we were not told we were to land first in St John's Canada to have a pilot change. They should have left us in Paris and resume normal schedules hours albeit a day late,  yet to add to this when the flight left St John's to arrive in Toronto, we were met at the Toronto airport by gate agents ready with hotel vouchers and new boarding passes for a flight to LAX the day after. I was told because the flight from Paris into Toronto landed after 9:00 PM there were no more flights into the US (we had landed a little past 10:00 PM). I went to the hotel where the shuttle took over an hour to arrive to pick us up after several calls to the front desk letting them know we were waiting (you would think the airline would have this a little more coordinated). Well by the time I got to the hotel it was midnight and I had to get up by 5:00 AM to catch the flight from Toronto to Los Angeles. Arriving at the airport at 5:45 AM I was told the flight to Los Angeles was delayed by one hour and 45 minutes so instead of leaving at 8:05 AM the flight now left at 9:45 AM. To add to the ordeal there also was a medical emergency on the flight to LAX, they flight had to understandably stay at the gate while paramedics attended to the patient. We finally land at Los Angeles a little before 11:00 AM only to find out my luggage did not make the flight. How can the luggage not make the flight when I was over 4 hours early checking in? (got to the airport 3 hours early for international flight and over 1 hour delayed flight - clearly they had plenty of time to verify and check the luggage). The personnel indicated to go to the Air Canada website to track luggage. Website provides little to no information. Basically has what I told them at the baggage claim at LAX yet does not track where the luggage is at.  After calling the agent at LAX, I was told my luggage landed at 5:00 pm..

flight has been changed,Y Kagisha,TripVerified,"  I booked the flights for later in September 2018 from Denver to Nagoya via Vancouver about 2 months ago. The original plan was making connections at Vancouver and the whole trip was around 18 hours. But a week before the departure day, they sent me an email saying ""Your flight has been changed. Check it out. If you have any questions, call us"". That was it. They didn't call me and just sent me the rescheduled flights. Like I've said, the original one was only 18 hours flight but the new one takes 3 days. ] Why should I stay in Canada for 2 days? ] Other flight tickets for the date got too expensive for me to afford. I called them right away and asked them to reschedule it and they did. I mean, they did have much better flights but they didn't give them to me from the get go. Now the flight time is around 25 hours which is not bad. But it was worse than the original one. On top of that, with those tickets, I have to make connections 3 times to get to Japan and I only have 45min ~ 1 hour for transit at each airport. I was concerned for the limited time so I called them again and explained everything to the operator. He didn't say anything while I was explaining and after that, he just said ""Yes, you have enough time. Any questions?"" It was so rude.

very happy flying with them,S Hussain,TripVerified, Montreal to London. Simply Amazing! I was on the verge of missing my flight as the airport transfer service from city is very poor and runs with severe delays (I was not aware of this). The ground check in staff realizing this whisked me quickly through the check in lane (where there were huge queues). I managed to get onto the flight. The plane was clean and nice. A B777. Fairly new. IFE was quite decent. Upon my request the check in staff very happily gave me a nice window seat as well. Food was decent as well. Cabin staff very courteous and polite. Flight landed almost on time (just few mins of delay which doesn't really matter).

6 days to get my suitcase,Tim Brust,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Charlotte. Flight was OK, but Air Canada's competence and caring stops there. I had a checked bag which they never sent to baggage claim. Since it was the last flight of the day (about 1 pm)--all Air Canada employees left the airport. I found that out after running from baggage carousel to baggage carousel and back and forth to the Air Canada desk and calling Air Canada customer service for two hours. They said they would contact the employees the next day and let me know what was up. Long story short--it took them 6 days to get my suitcase to me. I arrived on a Saturday but they didn't ship it out until Monday afternoon--and only because the flight was late and they were still there when the Fed Ex guy came. But it wasn't until Tuesday I knew it had beens ent--customer service knew nothing and I think just made things up. hey told me that the delivery guy didn't show up--and that the bag was going through a 48 hour security check--neither of which was true. And to top it all off--they didn't secure the shipping label properly--so the tag came off and was lost in transit. Did Air Canada customer service help? No--they had no tracking number--no information on the bag (which their website claimed was still missing) and no interest in contacting Fed Ex on my behalf. I had to track it down. I got my bag just in time to end my vacation and fly back home. I spent two to 3 hours everyday call Air Canada Charlotte, Air Canada customer service and Federal Express telling and retelling my story and tracking my bag down. Not a great vacation--and I had to wear the same couple of shirts and pairs of shorts I bought to tide me over for what I thought would be a couple of days without my clothes. Air Canada's compensation? My baggage fee back, payment for what little clothes and other items I had to buy--and a $100 voucher. Come on AIr Canada--in what world does compensation require that you pay more money to the entity compensating you in order to get anything in return?

didn't have a Canadian visa,Christina Alejandro,TripVerified,"  Yesterday my husband and I were all set to fly to Boston via Montreal. 5 minutes before boarding, they told us that I couldn't fly because I didn't have a Canadian visa. Since I have traveled many times before to countries without needing a visa for transit, this seemed quite peculiar. They told my husband that possibly he can travel alone and then they would find me a later flight via Toronto (which allowed no Canada visa). I agreed and resigned myself to staying the night in the airport overnight 'cause we live so far away (expensive to get there too). Then they said, ""no seats available for tomorrow). Fast forward - we decided for my husband to leave without me. There was a wedding we were supposed to attend in Maine and I didn't want him to miss that. He flew and I went home late at night hoping I could carry my luggage back to our 3rd floor apartment. So my husband arrives in Boston and messages me that Montreal told him I didn't need a transit visa. Though the Air Canada ground crew were all very nice to us and apologetic, this could have been prevented if they were more thorough with their checking. It was our wedding anniversary and we had to be apart. Such a big disappointment and stress-inducer. Good thing my husband was calm even though he was so mad inside. But I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. Please learn from this very sad experience of ours.

international leg went smoothly,M Keane,TripVerified,"  Paris to Newark via Montreal. The check-in process from Paris CDG went smoothly and the flight and service were operated by a courteous and efficient crew on the first leg of my flight (CDG>YUL). Following U.S. Customs & Border Control, there was a delay in flights into New York due to weather. After a small delay, our flight (AC885 @7:55pm) boarded anyway. Following another two delays of about an hour each on the tarmac, the captain announced air traffic control in New York was cancelling all flights for that evening. It was already 10pm, so there were no flights after the weather cleared up until the following morning. The cabin crew was very kind and helpful. They wanted us to get home as soon as possible, but since they couldn't do that were handing us bottles of water and pretzels during the delay and apologized as we de-planed. That said, everything following was a nightmare only exacerbated by the unhelpful staff at the check-in desk of Air Canada in Montreal. Because our plane was canceled due to weather, they handed us each a brochure detailing their policy on inclement weather. While they could not comp a hotel room, they said they would reschedule our flight for the following day. Because I booked through United, however, I was not receiving email notifications on the status of the new flight, and could not see details on the Air Canada website because I could not find the reservation number in the confirmation from United in my email. It was getting closer to midnight at this point and, understandably, the staff is on overtime and wants to go home as much as we did, but they were only grouping about to speak in French (which I understand and speak fluently) about the customers being difficult. I understand their hands were tied with the flight situation, but they were discouraging customers standing in line to rebook their flights with the booking staff because ""everything would be processed automatically"", but they did not even want to help me navigate the website to find my tracking information. Since my ticket was a United ticket, they figured I was last priority. Finally, in this time waiting, they just brought out a small cart of ginger ale and other sodas. I had to specifically ask one of the staff for water (which there should have been a stock of for situations like this). Overall I would say the international leg of my situation went smoothly, but I would avoid using this airline in the future for how little they seem to want to do about rebooking clients on missed flights.

return flights were canceled,Barbara Plante,NotVerified,"  Dublin to Atlanta via Toronto. Our initial flight was delayed and they could not get us to Dublin for a full day. They ended up putting us on a Delta flight which was delightful. But, consequently they did not enter it properly in the computer and we were listed as a “no show” and our return flights were canceled. We did not receive a notification about this and did not know about anything till we arrived two weeks later for our return flight. We were blamed for the error saying we canceled the flights. When someone finally figured out the error they noted in the file that it was “canceled by agent” agent is what they call their computer system. But the inexperienced and unfriendly desk clerks read this as our travel agent canceling our flight. It took us 50 hours to get home running from gate to gate on standbys . We received 10 $10 meal vouchers for 6 people. But we each had to stand inline for 45 minutes to get them one at a time and each time we had to prove that we deserved them by showing all of our documentation on our canceled flights.

decided to share his business class seat,Marie Hart,TripVerified,"  My husband and I travelled from Sydney to Chicago with a stop at Toronto. Hubby flew business class as his work paid for it, I flew economy. I attempted to get a business class seat two days after hubby, the price probably due to cookies had gone up $3000, so for a return ticket it went from $5000, to $8000 in two days. So I purchased an economy fare, Then I attempted to bid for an upgrade, I bid $2250, one way for an upgrade, that meant I would have paid $3250, one way. Initially Air Canada’s bid, as in it is a slider, was $3250, I moved the slider down to the lowest I could bid, coming up with $2250, one way. I received an email saying my bid was unsuccessful. So imagine my surprise to find empty seats in Business Class. So instead I purchase lounge access, which I paid fifty dollars. And got to use in Toronto. I found Air Canada’s lounge food is rubbish. Due to my unsuccessful bid to upgrade, Hubby and I decided to share his business class seat. However, on our leg home, one hostess was ok with it, whilst another hostess was downright abrupt and rude, claiming it was Air Canada’s policy that you can’t change seats. It wasn’t so much that the hostess made up a policy on the go, but it was her attitude demanding I get back to economy, yet she didn’t have anything to say to my husband upon his return, not one word. So do I recommend Air Canada, definitely not.

problem in their system,Maryam Sabour,TripVerified,"  Toronto to San Francisco. Air Canada has a problem in their system where they can't get the spelling of my name right. Every time I make a booking the system deletes the last letter of my name ""Maryam"" becomes ""Marya"". Because of this, I can never check-in online at their system and with any booking I have to see an in person agent every time. As a frequent flyer for business, I am a NEXUS holder, never check baggage and always check-in online to avoid long waiting lines. However because of this problem I will forever have to get to airport early, and stand in line to have an agent correct my name on my boarding pass otherwise security will not let me through with the error on my boarding pass. Last week I flew to SFO from YYZ and Air Canada refused to let me bypass an-hour long line to have the change made and get on to my flight. They told me security would not have a problem letting me through but of course what happened? Security would not let me through and made me go back and stand in line for the Air Canada agent to change my name on the boarding pass. This is insane for an airline like Air Canada to not solve a problem that affects every person whose first name ends in the letter ""M"". They told me the system thinks that ""M"" stands for Mr. or Ms. so it gets mixed up. When I reached out to the Customer Relations team, after providing me with a 25% one time discount, told me they would not help me further, update me on whether this issue would ever be solved, or speak to me regarding this issue again.

a total disappointment,J Berchaur,TripVerified,"  My flight was canceled due to a technical failure. It was the last flight out of Boston so there was no alternative for the day. We ended up in a long queue and were at the counter shortly before midnight, only to be told that the next available flight is 2 days from now. We politely declined and asked them to organise a hotel. They said there's nobody to do it and we should do it ourselves and expense the money back. Now finding a hotel in the middle of the night in Boston can be a real adventure. We managed to do it and were as conscious of cost as possible. In the end Air Canada only wanted to reimburse us a 100$ total for the hotel stay. We paid way more. Although they didn't care about what happened to us they didn't even want to cover basic costs. It's now over 4 weeks and we haven't seen a penny. The ticket cost were supposed to get charged back to my card end of June. Nothing has arrived yet.

worst customer service ,Larry Adams,TripVerified,"  Quebec to Austin via Toronto. I was to fly out of Quebec this morning with a connection in Toronto to Austin, TX. The flight was about 30 minutes delayed before the gate agent mentioned anything. I was actually receiving email alerts from Air Canada before hearing anything from the gate agent about the delays. My flight from Quebec was delayed 7 hours which left me no way of making my connection in Toronto. I went to the gate agent in order to re-book my connection. She very quickly told me I would have to worry about it when I got to Toronto and there was nothing they could do for me. I waited around 2 more hours and went back to the same gate agent. I again asked about re-booking my connection. She then gave me a pamphlet and told me to call their 800 number. Called the 800 number and waited on hold for 30 minutes. When someone finally answered it hung up the call on me. I called back and waited 45 minutes on hold. The guy that answered told me there were no other flights for the day that would get me back to Austin and he asked me if I could travel tomorrow (as if I had a choice in the matter). I had paid for premium seats on my initial flights (sounds as though I am out that money). He put me on hold as he booked me for the following day flights (I was on hold at least 20 minutes). During this time I booked a nearby hotel for the night because the pamphlet I was given said the airline would not be responsible for costs related to travel interruptions because it was beyond their control. I went back to the gate agent. Told her after 1.5 hours on the phone that I had been re-booked for tomorrow and asked her about getting my luggage back. The only good thing she did all day was call down and had my luggage pulled off the plane. Gave me a $10 meal voucher to the only place to eat in the airport which of course had a line wait of no less than 45 minutes due to all of the other stranded passengers. She then said she could get me to Toronto today (but still would have to spend the night in Toronto). If she could do that why couldn’t she have re-booked me to begin with instead of having me wait on the phone for 1.5 hours? Supervisor standing behind her seemed as though she could care less as well. So here I sit in a hotel room at my expense in Quebec. I will have to fight the battle with them tomorrow that I have already paid $60 to check my luggage from yesterday. I am sure they are going to want me to pay that again.

was pleasantly surprised,Dexter Lee,TripVerified,"  Paris to Montreal returning from Toronto in May. Had quite low expectations of Air Canada but was pleasantly surprised with their service. Friendly and warm cabin crew, several rounds of drinks on 7 hour sectors, and announcements in both English and French. Top-notch service from this crew as they were able to get for you what you needed. The seat was relatively comfortable and the inflight entertainment system had plenty of good choices. No fuss boarding at both CDG and YYZ, and their mobile boarding pass was a huge time saver at busy airports such as CDG. If there was one thing I didn't like it would be their in-flight catering - strange choice of mains such as shredded carrots on pasta was not very delicious, and they ran out of second options on both flights. However, pre-landing snacks were delicious and the wine selection was excellent.

"Staff friendly, courteous",C Luke,NotVerified,"  Round trip Brisbane-Vancouver-Brisbane. Third trip in 3yrs. Used to have to fly to Sydney to get to Vancouver on a 777, the 787 a much better experience.

The FA's were nice ,Leanne Bree,TripVerified,"  Booking with Air Canada, via Brisbane then Vancouver to Toronto. Initially they had me on a morning flight from Melbourne but I felt the time between flights was too tight, together with fog/winter issues so I called and arranged a flight the day before, it cost me an extra $300. The shock came at the airport when I found they downgraded me to economy, not a big issue except the $300 extra is more than a normal one way flight. Anyway determined to put this behind me, I used the kiosks at Brisbane airport to check in and self label my bags. The lounge (NZ) was really nice. Boarding was in zones with children going first, then zone 1-5 in order. The plane was a Boeing 787 with pods. Offered fruit juice or water and nuts to start, then handed menus. The FAs were nice but apart from meals, they were mostly absent, the meals were small but tasty. Then snacks (chips, water, chocolate and fruit) were left to help ourselves to. On the menu was a list of hot snacks on request. Meals were trolley service, like upmarket economy. Entertainment was ok, not extensive but adequate. The seat was a little hard but ok. Breakfast was nice although the FA gave me a lecture on sugar when I asked for milk and sugar in my coffee. After arrival in Vancouver and the necessary immigration procedure followed, it was off to domestic and the lounge. Stayed there just a few minutes, it was crowded, inadequate, little to offer, so I just walked around until the Toronto flight. Old plane, again boarded via zones. The food on board was dire. The nice FA offered me alternatives, I just opted for a cookie. The entertainment in board was better than the Dreamliner.

delayed my bags,S Andrews,TripVerified," Air Canada has delayed my bags on five separate occasions. Once on a trip to Halifax, once on a trip to Las Vegas and this is the third time they have done it on my trip to Italy. Halifax and Las Vegas were both five day trips, I spent the first three days of these trips without baggage. I understood that because I made connections that it is possible there was not enough time to properly get the bag onto the next flight. However, if this is something that often happens maybe it is best they stop charging for connections they do not have the capability of properly executing. This most recent flight to Milan, I checked in 4 hours early for a direct flight. There is absolutely no reason my baggage should have been left in Toronto. This is my third day in Italy without my baggage, how has it still not made it on another flight? I am writing a review on here because the customer service website for Air Canada is insufficient, there is no direct email for customer service, instead they lead you to numerous automated responses. Working in customer service myself, I understand that mistakes happen. However, considering I have given this company thousands of dollars over the last few years I am fed up. I see no reason why in 2018 they can charge $1,200 for a round trip, direct flight to Milan and be so behind that baggage cannot arrive with that flight. I am ready to ditch Air Canada completely and give another company my money.

flight was now cancelled,W Chilton,TripVerified,"  We had a short 1.5 hour flight from Vancouver to Calgary with a quick 30 min. layover in Kelowna. We got off the plane, and the next flight was delayed (we were suppose to board the same plane, but just pick up some passengers in Kelowna.) They come on the intercom and say the plane is broken so we need to call a number to re-book our flight to Calgary or get a partial refund. (Yes, it was our responsibility now.) We needed to get to a wedding reception, so time was of the essence. All 4 of us were on the phone trying to re-book the next flight, and we were put on hold. And hold. And hold. Then they came back saying they got us tickets, then put us on hold again. Finally came back and said ""sorry the next flight is now full"", but they have a flight leaving in a few hours with a layover in Edmonton and to arrive in Calgary around 9pm. We needed to get there so we jumped on that flight before it was full, we got new boarding passes, and went to sit at White Spot for some drinks. We waited about 2.5 hours and then that flight was now delayed. About an hour later they told us that the flight was now cancelled. So we just wasted hours in the airport waiting for nothing. We tried calling customer service but there were no more flights that evening and the next one was at 7:30 in the morning. FWe had called to ask for a refund so that we could jump on a flight with WestJet, but they said that was ""unlikely"" to happen. So now we were trying to get hotel vouchers, nobody would give us any sort of solid information. Every person we talked to told us to go talk to another person, or to call a different number. One guy had told us that all their hotel vouchers were ""exhausted"". So not only did they royally screw us for the entire day and night, but we weren't even going to get any sort of accommodation. The only good person we dealt with was an amazing lady who finally pulled some strings to get us a hotel, and she was helpful and knowledgeable.

all went above and beyond,K Leesen,TripVerified,"  I want to give a shout out and Kudos to the Air Canada staff in Paris and in Montreal. Our flight #881 from Paris to Toronto was delayed 8 hours due to weather. Once in Toronto we had another 4 hour drive back to Michigan. Staff at the ticket/customer service desk in Paris was awesome getting us moved to an earlier flight to Montreal then to Toronto. Once in Montreal, the staff were so helpful. Air Canada did not have to help us at all. They could have made us wait for the 9:00 pm flight, sitting in the Paris Airport for 12 hours then the flight and drive home.

passport slightly water damaged,Brit DalCais,TripVerified,"  Myself and my boyfriend planed a trip to Iceland and booked it with Air Canada. The way we were treated last night July 2nd 2018 flying at 23:20 flight to Reykavik flight number AC 816 was my worst experience with an airline. My boyfriends passport is slightly water damaged, but scans where we go. It has never not scanned until last night, but it wouldn't scan at the terminal. But what I'm having a hard time understanding is why were we stopped outside of the US? So we flew from NY to Toronto no problem, passport scanned and was accepted by Air Cananda staff. And then we are about to board in Toronto to go to Reykjavik and its no longer acceptable , why were we allowed to enter into Canada? So we proceeded to try to talk to the women who told us she couldn't do any thing because it wouldn't scan. And proceeded to tell us to go to customer service to see what can be done.  So we have to leave the terminal and go through border control, so my boyfriend hands over his passport to the  man working the counter, and now my boyfriends passport will scan. The young gentleman at the booth suggested she wasn't holding it on the machine long enough for it to read. So she refused us for a $2000 flight we booked. At this point its 24:00, we had been at Toronto airport for 6 hours because of delays. We need to go to customer service, rebook the flight, get a hotel and get our luggage. We go to customer service and had the best customer service thank god! The staff there was amazing and super helpful.

I am extremely unsatisfied,E Dutton,TripVerified,"  Houston to Vancouver via Calgary. We received several itineraries by email. I didn't realize that each one of these was an itinerary change. The last one moved our flight time up from 7:10 to 6:30am. Having 2 small children, we got to the ticket counter at 5:35 am which was plenty of time for our first flight time, but they would not let us on the flight because we missed the 1 hour check in by 5 minutes. The lady at the counter was unhelpful and rude. I called the rebooking number and they said there was another flight that same day (the lady at the counter said there wasn't). The rep on the phone said we need to book with the lady at the counter because it would cost much more if she did it on the phone. I went back to the lady at the counter and she was still completely unhelpful even when talking to the rep on the phone. The rep on the phone spoke with her supervisor who gave it to us at the same price because the rep at the counter refused to help. $450 later and hauling 2 very young children around at 4:30 am for no reason because our flight was changed without real notification (the email never stated there was an itinerary change that I noticed), I am extremely unsatisfied.

unable to get any premium seats,Henry Reis,Not Verified,"Vancouver to Montreal. This was my first time flying with a child. I have a 6-month-old son and my wife and I decided to pay extra to get premium economy seats and take advantage of more leg room and seats that would allow us to leave the plane quicker. As soon as I received an online confirmation of my purchase, I went on their website to select the premium seats, on their website. Every  time I selected the premium seats I wanted to use and hit 'confirm seat selection', the website would take me to another page, and then timed out my request. I tried to complete this procedure  11 times, to no avail. I then thought I might not be able to get the premium seats I want, but at least I have premium seats, so I'll try the regular check-in 24 hours before departure. To my surprise, I was unable to get any premium seats at all and no one could see on the system that I had paid for premium seats. The check-in staff then told me that there was no premium economy in that flight, just business or regular economy. That was a lie, as I found out as soon as I entered the plane. I almost went back to the counter to discuss why would they lie to me so I could just get in the plane and take the seat they assigned me instead of what I had paid for. I mean, think about it. If you pay for business and wait until you reach the airport to complete the check-in, you might not have a say in which seat you'll get, but you'll have a business seat. Same goes for first class, and one would think the same would apply to premium economy but apparently you can pay over $100/px for what they call the 'comfort package', and they don't care to hold the seat for you. The very least they could have done is to upgrade my wife and I to business, as there were empty seats there.

the lack of a dedicated FA,John Doig,TripVerified,"  Dublin to Toronto. I had not flown before in the new Premium Economy of Air Canada, although I had done so on several occasions with AC Rouge leisure subsidiary including on this route, before it was ‘transferred’ back to main-line AC. Check-in at DUB was problem free and expeditious as PE passengers can use the Premium lines. When this service was operated by AC Rouge PE passengers were directed to use DUB Fast Track security. This perk not offered on main-line AC. Boarding was as expected, PE being the second group to board after Business class. The flight appeared full, all seats were occupied in the PE section. The seats were a little more comfortable than those on Premium Rouge with perhaps a little more leg room. As this service departed DUB early afternoon, lunch was serviced not long after departure. There were 2 choices for the main course and the meal was serviced on china ware. No so the drinks with plastic glasses, (apart form a wine glass on the meal tray!) and coffee/tea from paper cups. This is a downgrade from Rouge PE where real glasses and china mugs for coffee/tea are used. The second meal or snack was exactly the same as offered in Premium Rouge. A significant difference was the lack of a dedicated FA to PE. FAs in PE are shared with Economy, with Economy being a much larger cabin, at times there was no FA to be seen in PE. With Rouge PE there is dedicated FA at all times. Another difference is that the FAs on main-line are more mature, and for the most part more experienced. The flight arrived on time and dis-embarkation was as expected, PE exited followed Business class passengers.

very slow to solve the situation,Michelle Ratton,TripVerified," I had my flight cancelled today, and I (and all other passengers) had the following difficulties: 1) The flight was cancelled by email before being announced as cancelled.

It was a late flight (11.15 pm) and they were very slow to solve the situation. Therefore, a group of people could not go to the hotel and got stuck in the airport. The group of about 20 people had to stay outside the security area from 2am until 4am with CAN30 for dinner and brekfast meals. 3) No alternative to these passengers was presented. 4) Air Canada shamily sent an email with a promocode to be used in the next 60 days, otherwise it will expire.

Check in at Pearson wasn't busy but the staff at the bag drop area had such a rude attitude that made for an unpleasant start to the trip. Boarding was a complete mess, as they were boarding a 400-seater aircraft through a relatively small gate, with no real division for the Economy Class zone boarding normally found for international flights. Because of this, the line clogged the entire walkway of the terminal with people. A lot of bags had to be gate checked due to the full flight, thus, delaying the boarding even further. None the less, the flight departed and arrived on time. The seat, while acceptable for its width, has an unacceptable seat pitch. I couldn't imagine spending more than three hours in that seat, even the thought of bearing a 13-hour flights AC's 777-300ER flies on. The crew was slow but courteous, serving a full flight. Only drinks were complimentary for this flight. Entertainment selection was sufficient for the domestic flight, with some movies only having trailers available for some reason.

The meals in First class were tasty, combined with a choice of wines. The seats were comfortable. I noticed some upgrades on the amenity kit and a small matress was provided for the seat on the return leg. Overall Air Canada has a competitive business Class product.

There was no snacks during flight, when I went to the galleys, the only that they could offer me were some crackers. For breakfast they offer only a piece of cake and coffee.

unimpressed and disappointed,S Farmer,TripVerified,"  Edmonton to Halifax via Toronto. What started out as a very pleasant experience as a nice young man in Edmonton moved us up to nicer seats that were together, quickly became a disaster of an experience. After boarding our flight in Toronto and sitting on the runway for over an hour we were told we must leave the plane as it isn’t safe to fly. We were then told we would have to wait another 2 and a half hours until our next flight, ruining our dinner and holiday plans for the evening. After being told we would be leaving at 530 for sure from Pearson I was again frustrated to find we weren’t even boarding until 530, and then got to sit yet again on the runway for over an hour while the flight crew figured everything out. This entire experience was very frustrating, a terrible way to start a holiday and was made worse by the lack of compensation for our time and frustration by Air Canada, no food vouchers, or drinks were offered and nothing more than an explanation every 45 minutes was given. I am extremely unimpressed and disappointed, as I continue to sit on the runway still waiting to take off at some undetermined time.",21st April 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edmonton to Halifax via Toronto,April 2018,2,1,0,0,1,1,2,"['Edmonton', 'Halifax', 'Toronto']",3,7.0,5,1.4,-0.75,0.03676470588235294,"['via', 'started', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'nice', 'young', 'man', 'moved', 'nicer', 'seats', 'together', 'quickly', 'became', 'disaster', 'experience', 'boarding', 'sitting', 'runway', 'hour', 'told', 'must', 'leave', 'plane', 'safe', 'fly', 'told', 'wait', 'another', 'half', 'hours', 'ruining', 'dinner', 'holiday', 'plans', 'evening', 'told', 'leaving', 'sure', 'pearson', 'frustrated', 'find', 'boarding', 'sit', 'yet', 'runway', 'hour', 'crew', 'figured', 'everything', 'entire', 'experience', 'frustrating', 'terrible', 'way', 'start', 'holiday', 'worse', 'lack', 'compensation', 'time', 'frustration', 'food', 'vouchers', 'drinks', 'offered', 'nothing', 'explanation', 'every', 'minutes', 'given', 'extremely', 'unimpressed', 'disappointed', 'continue', 'sit', 'runway', 'still', 'waiting', 'take', 'undetermined', 'time']","['unimpressed', 'disappointed']",pos
incompetent handling delays,L Walsh,TripVerified,"  I understand that there can be delays. Air Canada is incompetent in effectively handling delays in particular for business travelers. There are a lot of negative reviews of Air Canada for everything from overall friendliness to food. I care about those things – but as a business traveler I care most about getting to my destination on time, and that delays are handled effectively and knowledgeably when there are disruptions so that I can still get to my destination as needed. I was flying from Pittsburgh to Shanghai via Toronto. My flight was delayed to Toronto, causing me to miss my flight to Shanghai. There were two other flights that could have gotten me to Shanghai in time for my meeting. Due to the incompetence of the Air Canada staff I missed both. In particular, there is no Business Class line at the re-ticketing counter. I waited for an hour and a half – missing both other flight options. I was behind domestic travelers with multiple rerouting options and coach fares. Even when I called over a “supervisor” and explained the situation I was told there was nothing she could do, she couldn’t get me to the front of the line, and I would just have to wait my turn. I was going for a board meeting, with my executive team flying in from all over the world for this meeting. All other travel and arrangements – for all of the other people – needed to be rearranged due to my travel issues. I am a frequent Air Canada traveler. I go to Asia at a minimum twice a year in Business Class. I fly every other week on an expensive (typically $500) ticket to my other office domestically. When I called ""Customer Service"" they were rude, told me there was no management escalation (no way I could talk to a supervisor), and showed absolutely no flexibility. My experience with customer service just added insult to injury. I am taking the time to write this review on as many review sites as I can. I don’t typically write reviews. In this case, however, I really want to warn other business travelers – in particular overseas business travelers – that they are not at all equipped to handle the inevitable travel disruptions and prioritize business class tickets. And that’s in addition to the relatively uncomfortable business class seats, poor customer service, and bad food.",20th April 2018,Business,Business Class,Pittsburgh to Shanghai via Toronto,March 2018,3,2,3,3,1,1,1,"['Pittsburgh', 'Shanghai', 'Toronto']",3,14.0,7,2.0,-0.35,-0.04374999999999999,"['understand', 'delays', 'incompetent', 'effectively', 'handling', 'delays', 'particular', 'business', 'travelers', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'everything', 'overall', 'friendliness', 'food', 'care', 'things', 'business', 'traveler', 'care', 'getting', 'destination', 'time', 'delays', 'handled', 'effectively', 'knowledgeably', 'disruptions', 'still', 'destination', 'needed', 'flying', 'via', 'delayed', 'causing', 'miss', 'gotten', 'time', 'meeting', 'due', 'incompetence', 'staff', 'missed', 'particular', 'business', 'class', 'line', 'counter', 'waited', 'hour', 'half', 'missing', 'options', 'behind', 'domestic', 'travelers', 'multiple', 'rerouting', 'options', 'coach', 'fares', 'called', 'supervisor', 'explained', 'situation', 'told', 'nothing', 'front', 'line', 'wait', 'turn', 'going', 'board', 'meeting', 'executive', 'team', 'flying', 'world', 'meeting', 'travel', 'arrangements', 'people', 'needed', 'rearranged', 'due', 'travel', 'issues', 'frequent', 'traveler', 'asia', 'minimum', 'twice', 'year', 'business', 'class', 'fly', 'every', 'week', 'expensive', 'typically', 'ticket', 'office', 'domestically', 'called', 'customer', 'service', 'rude', 'told', 'management', 'escalation', 'way', 'talk', 'supervisor', 'showed', 'absolutely', 'flexibility', 'experience', 'customer', 'service', 'added', 'insult', 'injury', 'taking', 'time', 'write', 'review', 'many', 'review', 'sites', 'typically', 'write', 'reviews', 'case', 'really', 'want', 'warn', 'business', 'travelers', 'particular', 'overseas', 'business', 'travelers', 'equipped', 'handle', 'inevitable', 'travel', 'disruptions', 'prioritize', 'business', 'class', 'tickets', 'addition', 'relatively', 'uncomfortable', 'business', 'class', 'seats', 'poor', 'customer', 'service', 'bad', 'food']","['incompetent', 'handling', 'delays']",neg

flights were canceled upon arrival,S Lang,TripVerified,"  Seoul to Minneapolis via Toronto. Once we arrived at the Toronto Airport, the staff there were so unorganized. They had really bad attitudes & when we asked for directions, the first thing this woman did was questioned us why we were there & told us to go back to the direction where we came from. Coming back from my international destination, when everyone was seated in the plane, it was announced that there were “technical” issues & we would have to sit in the plane for 45 minutes. Well, that turned to an hour & half. Even worst was dealing with flight attendants for 13 hours. Our landing was postponed for an hour due to technical issues and the weather condition. Majority of travelers' flights were canceled upon arrival, and the people at Toronto Pearson (Terminal 1) were helpless. There was no one directing people to where they needed to go for assistance. The lines started to get long at Gate 15 at departures but there was absolutely no one to direct people where to line up or answer questions. We waited at the phone line for 1.5 hour just to wait another hour to speak with a representative. Getting impatient, I ended up at the hotel line for 2 hours just to find out it was to book a hotel when we just wanted to rebook our cancelled flight. Once we got to the Air Canada counter, the lady didn’t even care to look anything up on her computer & just told us to call this number that didn’t even work because it had “reach capacity.” Basically, the only help most of the 300+ travelers got were from other travelers. Also, this worker came onto the intercom to announce to us that they are doing their best to help us. Following that announcement came some short responses from frustrated travelers.  We spent the night at the airport and they closed Gate 15 down & turned people away. When I asked about the hotel vouchers, the man questioned me & my intentions instead of help, there was no one floating around to help travelers with cancelled flights.

Worst airline I’ve flown on,D Vage,TripVerified,  Montreal to New York LGA. Ridiculous transfer flight manipulation.

a subject of itinerary change,V Geetham,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Wellington via Sydney. I booked the ticket for my mother to travel Wellington, New Zealand from Vancouver, Canada. I booked in mid-February to travel in April beginning. My mother is old and has limited English. So i want her to travel hassle free for her vacation. The reason I choose air Canada 1) Price wise i can save about 150$ compared to the next cheap flight 2) I don't want to transit at Auckland because she needs to take a bus between international arrival and local departure at Auckland. 3) Air Canada's transit at Sydney only 3 hours and she can clear the bags at Wellington. My mother is Canadian and she doesn't require an ETA or transit visa to Australia if she has less than 8 hours transit. Exactly two days before the travel, we have received an email from Air Canada with a subject of itinerary change. No information inside the email except the itinerary. As per the new itinerary, transit at Sydney become 10 hours from just 3.5 hours. Same day evening we called the Air Canada to seek the reason. The person came to the phone didn't tell the reason. He just says the transit changed. Then we request for accommodation but he refused. Finally, we request the food voucher as a compensation for their possible mistake. He said they can provide that at the airport. ultimately its a useless conversation for us.( Nothing provided at the airport at the end.) Then only we realized my mother required an ETA or transit visa to Australia. Transit visa is free but it could take up to 5 days to get it. So we apply for ETA and luckily we received almost immediately. As per there website, this could take up to 12 hours sometime. We were not happy about Air Canada's behavior. So on the same day, we file a complaint with Air Canada and asked them to reply immediately since the next day my mother was flying. It is now almost 5 days and my mother in New Zealand for 3 days. But no reply from Air Canada until now. Money wise we are not losing anything but this was making us nervous. Unnecessary stress. Especially my mother. 150$ is lots of money. But I think next time I won't worry about even 500$.

When boarding at 16:05, the boarding gate staff said the flight was full, put us on 18:20. If you did not have seat why would you check us in.

very reluctant to help me,Peter Marsland,TripVerified,"  London to Havana via Toronto. The flights were fine. The staff were efficient and pleasant on board. However, prior to travel I contacted customer services by email for basic information about whether the airline covers the cost of the Cuban visa card and airport taxes (they do). They were very reluctant to help me. Customer Services actually told me they only deal with customers after flights have taken place! Eventually my travel agent gave me a telephone number to contact the carrier, and I got the information I needed. On the Toronto to Havana flight both ways with Air Canada rouge, no meal was provided, which came as a surprise on a scheduled flight. In Toronto, Air Canada ground staff were very dismissive and unhelpful when we sought information on baggage. Havana check in told us we needed to retrieve bags at Toronto, even though the baggage tag showed check in through to destination. Air Canada staff seemed unable to give clear guidance. Two members of staff told us to reclaim the baggage, but could not tell us what to do when we had reclaimed it. I had great difficulty getting another member of staff to focus on my question: she just wanted to turn away from me. Compared to travel with other national carriers recently, Air Canada was poor.

check in all the roller bags,M Hamton,TripVerified,"  Portland to Vancouver.

They could just sky check the bags and all would be okay, but they stopped that service also (second flight in two weeks they have done this to me on). They told us because it is a Q400 that they have to check in all the roller bags - this causes all sorts of delays upon arrival into Vancouver and is problematic if you have a connection due to a late inbound AC flight that delayed you to start with!

Air Canada cancels this flight,Tara Bradley-Steck,TripVerified,"  Pittsburgh to Barbados via Toronto. Air Canada has a regularly scheduled 7am flight from Pittsburgh to Toronto that connects with many flights headed to the Caribbean. In our case, on Feb. 4 we intended to connect with a flight to Barbados, from where we would take a short flight to Union Island in the Grenadines and then a short ferry to Palm Island. Problem is: Air Canada cancels this flight - and not infrequently. On this day, Air Canada cited the reason as lack of crew. Really? You can't schedule adequate crew? And Air Canada didn't tell us it canceled the flight until we were on our way to the airport at 5 a.m. What are we to do then? In our case, we had only one other option, which was to buy a last-minute ticket on JetBlue via Fort Lauderdale for $772. Unfortunately, the flight got us in too late to make the connection to Union Island, which means we had to pay for a hotel in Barbados and repurchase the $285 non-refundable airfare to Union Island -- not to mention forfeit the first night at our final destination. Air Canada doesn't compensate you for the cancellation, other than to refund the original one-way ticket. They gave us coupons worth $300 Canadian. That barely makes up the difference between the original ticket and the Jet Blue ticket. Their comment was ""schedules cannot be guaranteed and they do not form part of the contract of travel.""

At the gate, the boarding was very disorganized and passengers boarded in all wrong zones. The plane’s Auxillary Power Unit  was not working and therefore it was very hot.

I found the service terrible,C Martin,TripVerified," We were delayed coming out of Vancouver on Feb 23 due to a snowstorm. We sat in the plane on the tarmac for 3 hrs waiting to de-ice, so a total of 8 hrs on this plane on this flight. I do not have any issues with the delay, this is weather related and out of anyone's control. However we had one drink the whole time we were on this flight and they ran out of food. So basically 8 hrs on a plane with one drink and no food. The service starts at the beginning of the plane and works it's way to the back which takes a long time for those sitting at back of plane. As well I had to ask for my drink 3 times after I paid for it, and each time they asked me what I had ordered. Once we connected to the ramp in Toronto it was another 50 minutes to de-board the plane and another 35 minutes to get luggage, as 4 flights were all on one baggage carriage to come through. Overall I found the service terrible, the snack I was able to get also was terrible and did not find a friendly experience overall with any of the staff. My coworker who also was on the plane rang for service several times no one ever came. I have travelled with Air Canada several times and for one reason or another there always seems to be an issue.

we bid for an online upgrade,Mike Palmer,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver in Premium Economy. In deciding which airline to take, we put weight on using AC on a direct flight with my partner having 50k Elite. The flaw in this was assuming 50k elite meant something and that a direct flight with one stop was fool proof. After booking the flight, we found we could only select seats available for both legs. So with no twins in a 2-4-2 formation available for both legs, we were forced to select an aisle and middle seat. (though different twins were available on either leg). Call centre and ground staff were unable to allocate different twins available for each leg as it's one flight / boarding card. We bid online for a cash upgrade and initially had money taken from our credit card only to have it returned to our account within hours. A request at the gate in Toronto for a seat change on either leg was answered with ""ask in Vancouver"". An on time departure but a poor meal service. Neither my partner or I got our choice of meal. A very average stew of veal was provided followed by drinks. On spotting an IPA ale on the cart appearing from club, I was told the IPA was a premium beer and not available in PPremium Economy. The service just feels ill thought out with a meal before a drink! At Vancouver, we were told we couldn't swap seats as we should have asked in Toronto! My partner was initially upgraded for free to biz as Premium Economy and Economy were over-sold which was then withdrawn when a connecting flight ran late and all classes suddenly available. Another average ""slop meal"" followed by drinks followed served by a very capable and very senior crew. After this alleged enhanced meal, service morphed into Economy with standard mid flight sandwich and an inedible breakfast. A late arrival was followed by late bags. The day before our return we were informed of a four hour delay. On arriving at the airport we checked in fine, and my partner invited to the Air NZ lounge as a star alliance gold member. (no invite for me as it's it's another airline's lounge) Despite the 4 hour delay the base manager wouldn't budge and bizarrely - no vouchers for food were issued despite an 4 hour+ delay. On boarding, we found out the original crew ran out of hours in Vancouver and it operated 12 hours late to Sydney with a spare crew who needed minimum rest. In terms of upgrades (again), we bid the max for an online upgrade and still didn't' get it. An ok meal served with drinks again served after. On arrival in Vancouver 5 hours late, we found the second leg had left on time with another aircraft and we had been bumped to other flights. (no announcements before arrival into Vancouver) At the gate, we were given PE seats and split up BUT on the original aircraft (with a new flight number in view of our original twin seats) Others from Sydney were in the same position a lot of angry customers feeling let down. Another average meal and drinks rounded off my most average Premium Economy experience ever. On the plus side, all crews were great with plenty of drinks runs. The fundamental design and architecture of this route is flawed. The inflexibility is annoying though when it suits AC, they will split the flight in two to maintain punctuality.

Customer service is certainly not a priority,S Jackson,TripVerified," We travel quite frequently and I can honestly say that traveling Air Canada has been the worst experience we have ever encountered. We left from Columbus, Ohio to Paris with a transfer in Toronto. When we got to the airport with the 3 hours that is recommended for foreign travel, no one was at the Air Canada counter. When they finally did arrive we were told that our flight to Toronto was delayed and as a result, we would not be able to go to Paris until the next day. Rather than assist us with alternative flight plans we were given a number to call, which proved to be futile. Our AAA representative was finally able to find a flight (American Airlines) for us so that we were able to get to Paris on the day we were scheduled. On our way home from Paris we encountered a 2 hour delay, with no explanation as to the reason. We got to Toronto with little time to spare for our connection to Columbus. Our luggage was not on the flight, and when we contacted the airlines the following day as to the whereabouts of our luggage we were told that ""the system was down"".

no one has taken any action,Paul Dunn,TripVerified,"  Hong Kong to Columbus via Toronto. We reached Toronto and flight to Columbus was cancelled due to snowstorm. That is when it took them over 4 hours to get us to a hotel. In that time the agents acted as if they had never handled a similar situation. There was no one in charge, or not, who could tell us anything for over 2 1/2 of those hours. I was assigned next day to the very next CMH flight. I asked about my luggage and was assured it would be on that flight. It was not. I filed a claim at CMH, and later was told it was lost, so I filed another 3 days later. The flight to Toronto was on the 12th of January, and it is now February 11th. I have called the lost baggage line multiple times over this period, and no one has taken any action that led to finding my luggage. It was obvious that there was no plan on their part to try to find it, as no one at any time has been able to tell me where it is. One agent tried to track and said he thought it was put on a flight to Pittsburgh on the 13th of January, stayed there 5 days, and was sent by protocol then to Montreal. I asked them how to contact Montreal baggage center and he said that even agents can not call them in Montreal, they can only email them. He stated that he would, nothing happened. I begged another agent a few days later to do something to locate the luggage. He seemed genuine in his concern, and said he would do a thorough investigation and get back to me in 2 hours. He did not contact me again. I had many souvenirs from Hong Kong and gifts from friends as I got engaged on the visit. I feel their system is set up to only deal with the ordinary travel situations. They have given no priority at Air Canada at all to helping passengers in a situation in which they send their luggage to the wrong place. The agents on scene in Toronto, and the leased agents they had in Columbus were at times disrespectful to us. The agents who knew what they were doing or were kind operate in an airline that shows no respect in these situations, and has not once reached out to me to help in correcting the situation. The only contact has been initiated by me. I believe their policy is ""let them complain, eventually they will go away!"" In this instance they are wrong.

the worst airline I’ve ever flown,Bryce Livingston,TripVerified," Do not use this airline! Original flight out of Calgary was cancelled. I was not permitted to speak directly to an attendant. Instead I was given a customer service number. After 30 minutes on hold, I finally got my flight re-scheduled for the following day. I had to cover my own lodging. The following day, I sought to get on standby for an earlier flight which I received a ticket for. While boarding, I was told my bag was too large and they made me check it. The moderately rude attendant told me that I could change the baggage claim if I got on an earlier flight out of Toronto. When I got to Toronto, I asked to get on standby for the 16.55 flight to Syracuse. After waiting at the unoccupied customer service counter for over 30 minutes, the attendant there said I couldn’t because I had a checked bag. That flight was already delayed to 18.30 for mechanical issues. My original flight of 20.10 then also got “mechanical issues” and was delayed to 21.45. The carelessness of Air Canada employees is upsetting and the airline’s ability to problem solve is severely lacking. The entertainment amenities on the planes is worse than most other airlines. They nickle and dime customers be charging for small packets of pretzels. Finally, if someone gets a cancelled flight while trying to fly into the US, he/she cannot request a different route or city hub to fly though unless he/she is willing to pay for another connecting flight.

I booked this trip to UK for Xmas back in August for three people (12 adults and 1 teenager) including extra baggage and seat assignment for less than $1,000 cad each. I had very low expectations. One the return flight we had an older A330, which definitely looks old school now, but with better leg room and personal space than the Boeing 787. The seats feel abused and lacking cushion for sure. Having said that the crew were pleasant, easy going and efficient. They served drinks, then a meal service, then another drinks service, then a snack service and I can say for once I wasn't hungry or grossed out by what they offered. Even got a ""free"" 2nd bottle of cheap red wine. The flight was ahead of schedule landing and we even relaxed enough to socialize with our fellow passengers on board and make new friends.

unacceptable treatment,S Kent,TripVerified," Vancouver to Sault Ste Marie via Toronto. My flight was cancelled as I arrived to the airport, without any explanation, as another airline operating the same aircraft type, landed and took off safely. I was given an alternative to leave on Thursday instead of scheduled Monday flight, with no concern of how am I supposed to pay for my stay in Sault Ste Marie for additional 3 days, missing work at the same time. No food vouchers, hotel or any other accommodations were offered. No alternative flights were offered. Nor from another city, nor from different airline. Unacceptable treatment of customers, with no effort made whatsoever to rectify the situation. I was left with no alternative but miss work, look for accommodation and pay for food for three days. Every passenger on the flight was treated in the same manner. Cancellation email was received after I've returned from the airport, and the monitors still showed the flight as delayed. AC replied to my claim, stating that they ""don't reimburse delays due to extreme weather"" and offered me 25% discount on the future flights. Please note - the airport wasn't closed, as Porter flight, using the same aircraft type, arrived and left on time. Also, I wasn't offered any alternative and was told that I have to ""get to Sudbury myself if I want to fly from there"", as well as the claim that ""my expenses on the ground will not be reimbursed, because flight cancellation was caused by extreme weather"". I was left stranded for three days, with no explanation and means of accommodation. Not even mentioning I was already avoiding Air Canada, now I will do everything possible not to fly with them again. Unfortunately, they hold monopoly on flights within the country for the most part. Hence the price of the flight to Australia with Qantas could be as low as CAD $937 to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane and Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Sault Ste Marie is CAD $1200 is you are lucky.",10th January 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Sault Ste Marie via Toronto,January 2018,2,3,2,3,1,3,1,"['Vancouver', 'Toronto']",2,15.0,7,2.142857142857143,0.0,0.07101449275362319,"['sault', 'ste', 'marie', 'via', 'cancelled', 'arrived', 'airport', 'explanation', 'another', 'airline', 'operating', 'aircraft', 'type', 'landed', 'took', 'safely', 'given', 'alternative', 'leave', 'thursday', 'instead', 'scheduled', 'monday', 'concern', 'supposed', 'pay', 'stay', 'sault', 'ste', 'marie', 'additional', 'days', 'missing', 'work', 'time', 'food', 'vouchers', 'hotel', 'accommodations', 'offered', 'alternative', 'offered', 'another', 'city', 'different', 'airline', 'unacceptable', 'treatment', 'customers', 'effort', 'whatsoever', 'rectify', 'situation', 'left', 'alternative', 'miss', 'work', 'look', 'accommodation', 'pay', 'food', 'three', 'days', 'every', 'passenger', 'treated', 'manner', 'cancellation', 'email', 'received', 'returned', 'airport', 'monitors', 'still', 'showed', 'delayed', 'ac', 'replied', 'claim', 'stating', 'reimburse', 'delays', 'due', 'extreme', 'weather', 'offered', 'discount', 'future', 'please', 'note', 'airport', 'closed', 'porter', 'using', 'aircraft', 'type', 'arrived', 'left', 'time', 'offered', 'alternative', 'told', 'want', 'fly', 'well', 'claim', 'expenses', 'ground', 'reimbursed', 'cancellation', 'caused', 'extreme', 'weather', 'left', 'stranded', 'three', 'days', 'explanation', 'means', 'accommodation', 'mentioning', 'already', 'avoiding', 'everything', 'possible', 'fly', 'unfortunately', 'hold', 'monopoly', 'within', 'country', 'part', 'hence', 'price', 'australia', 'qantas', 'low', 'cad', 'sault', 'ste', 'marie', 'cad', 'lucky']","['unacceptable', 'treatment']",pos
"everything was neat, tidy and clean",H Ding,TripVerified," A great flight from Air Canada, returning from Frankfurt to Calgary in premium economy. The majority of my recent flights have been on AC (also flown WestJet, EasyJet, and Lufthansa, I've found that AC compares favourably). Getting on board on this flight, I let my clean-obsession take over. If there was something out of place or noticeably dirty on or around my seat, I'd notice. But everything was neat, tidy and clean. The flight was on time. The cabin crew on AC is usually friendly, but this time I was struck by just how pleasant they were: My request for an extra meal (it was a 21-hour-long travel day for me) was immediately accommodated. The attendant came around in good time and offered more wine to the cabin without people even asking. When I missed the second meal (breakfast wraps) because I was asleep, the attendant brought me two servings to make up for it. When I asked for coffee, the attendant brought a handful of something, saying: 'I didn't know if you wanted sugar-and-cream or Baileys, so I brought both - choose wisely! I chose wisely and went with Baileys - and I'll choose Air Canada again because believe it or not, this kind of service and friendliness is pretty typical on most flights, and I've flown with them on countless times. There have been delays, but nothing not related to weather or maintenance; and most delays were compensated by vouchers or flight discounts.

exceptional at apologizing,J Solmon,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to San Jose. There is nothing terrible about the flight itself, it’s relative brevity / directness (2hrs), the staff, or other normalcies you’d expect from a flight. I have taken this flight both ways approx every 3 weeks for the last 9 months and I get to the destination between 30-60mins late on average (enough so that I plan for it in my calendar and always arrive the airport 10mins prior to boarding as I know there will be extra waiting). Today it’s some kind of maintenance issue (we’ll likely be delayed 3-4hrs before takeoff is the estimate over the loudspeaker).  It’s routine for Air Canada to be delayed on this particular flight. It seems Air Canada is exceptional at apologizing for things though - I’ve heard more of the phrase “I’m sorry” on this flight than anywhere else (and I’m Canadian, so very used to hearing it regardless of context). I’m not a complainer, and a frequent flier, so understand all the things that can go wrong and have sat through most of them. I’m not sitting here fuming or anything. I have a phone / laptop and can work. It’s just something about the inconsistency of this particular flight that I’m hoping to prepare people for.

Terrible ground service,P Keane,TripVerified,"  Copenhagen to Toronto intending to connect to a final destination in Florida. The flight was fine, our problems started the second we touched down in Canada. During the flight, we were asked if our final destination was the US or Canada and given the appropriate customs form. However, on getting there, we discover that we still have to go through Canadian customs and so needed the Canadian form too. We then had to get to a waiting area for our bags to come off the Air Canada flight and go through to US customs. On the airplane and by several signs in the terminal not to pick up our bag for customs; it would go directly through. My bag took 2 hours to get to where it needed to go and my companion’s bag was lost. So, naturally, at this point we can’t get to our next flight because US customs requires your checked bag to be accounted for first. So, we missed our next flight. It’s a busy time of year so no other flights were available for two days. We go to the counter to get a hotel since it’s their fault we couldn’t continue on our trip. We’re told by one employee to go talk to another, who gives us the phone number of their help line. I spend half an hour on hold waiting to talk to them only to be told they can’t do hotel vouchers over the phone and I have to talk to someone in the terminal. We finally get our hotel, but they’ll only book it for one night because their policy is we have to try again tomorrow to get rebooked on an earlier flight. So, today, now the day after our original flight, I spend another half hour on hold trying to save them money by getting an earlier flight and not having to spend another night in a hotel only to be told that because another airline operates our final flight, they can’t do anything. So my travel companion goes to the Air Canada counter to get us approved for another night at the hotel. When she finally talks to someone, they tell her she needs to speak to the person at the ticketing counter to be told again that there are no earlier flights to Florida before they’ll approve a second hotel night. So now she’s waiting in line to talk to a ticketing agent and they only have two clerks at the desk and a line of over forty people when there are a lot of passengers displaced during this time of year all trying to get home.

Our flight got delayed,Marina Chekonova,TripVerified,"  Toronto to Vancouver. First of all, our flight from Vancouver on Dec 23, 2017 was cancelled and we were never notified by Air Canada. We came to the airport and found that we need to take another flight, which was delayed and we couldn’t make connection from Toronto to Quebec on time. We had to spend 1,5 hours to find another ticket and it was just the beginning of nightmare. Our flight was Premium Economy, and the ticket was changed to economy without any refund or explanation whatsoever. I had a fracture in my spine and metal rod was installed, that was the reason for Premium class and a window seat, so that I wouldn’t suffer from pain. Instead we were seated by the toilet in economy and I had severe pain through the flight and a day after. When we finally got to Toronto our flight to Quebec got delayed and we had to wait another 2,5 hours. We got there eventually, but on the way back it was the same story. Our flight got delayed, we did not make it to our connection flight and on Dec 30, 2017 we got stuck in Montreal. Air Canada provided accommodation after an argument, but we had to take an extra flight to make it home on December 31, 2017. Thank you Air Canada for screwing up New Years for us.

never fly this airline again,R Leane,TripVerified,"  I took this flight from Vancouver to San Diego with my husband and son on Dec 28th. The flight was scheduled from 8pm - 11pm. 7:30 PM - Upon arrival at the departure gate we were informed the plane was delayed for an unspecified period of time. 8:40 PM - We boarded 40 mins late. My family all had only carry on bags, which we quickly realized would not fit in the overhead compartments - along with a many other passengers. Our bags were taken from us to be placed under the plane, and would have to retrieved via the carousel in San Diego. It seemed odd that all the flight staff watched us board with bags they knew would not fit in the plane? The overhead compartments were broken and duct taped in several places on the plane. One gentlemen even remarked that he thought the front window of the plane was duct taped. 9:20 - Takeoff The plane seemed very old and in dire cosmetic disrepair. The flight staff were friendly. They mentioned that another crew was scheduled to work the flight we were on but were delayed so they were working on a 12 hour day. No snacks were offered, only water, coffee and juice. Staff was pleasant, in cabin entertainment was working. 11:40 - We approached San Diego to learn we had to divert to LAX due to fog. Everyone was obviously disappointed and also confused because it didn't appear foggy. Once in LA we sat in a deserted area of the airport hoping to be accepted for deplaning. Several announcements were made to try and appease our frustrations but the pilot himself seemed utterly defeated. He mentioned that he ""we shouldn't worry, because they were already assured we wouldn't have to return to Vancouver."" We were just sitting there on the tarmac waiting for something to happen. At one point there was supposed to be a bus coming to get us and staff to help accommodate our various scenarios. 1:30 AM - We were able to utilize a deplaning corridor (our plane was too small to fit against the tunnel opening, so we walked down the stairs of the plane and up into the terminal via a second set. Not a big deal but just fed the flames of frustration people were feeling.) We were encouraged that an Air Canada staffer would meet us at the luggage carousel to advise us of our compensation / options. We were also told the reason the plane didn't land in San Diego was because the in flight crew had worked 12 hours and wanted out of the air and didn't want to circle to wait to land. We checked the flight status at San Diego airport and it appeared all other flights were landing. 2:00 AM - Air Canada staffers advised those of us wishing to leave to submit car rental vouchers to Air Canada, those in need of boarding stayed back. I will try this but some other folks with previous experiences of this nature didn't seem hopeful that we would be reimbursed. I will remain hopeful. We rented a car for $100 from Avis. 4:00 AM - We arrived at Hotel in San Diego. My parents were to arrive in San Diego today to meet us on the same Air Canada flight 8 pm - 11pm. After our experience yesterday, I was very worried for them. Rightfully so, the flight was cancelled right at 8:00 PM ""no pilot"".

Our inflight entertainment didn’t work out on our way down, and we were left with an expensive hotel and taxi bill while delayed in Montreal.

cheap and nasty headsets,B Brown,TripVerified," Hong Kong to Vancouver. Our family decided to try out the premium economy service given that it was such a long flight plus the rather lacklustre reviews I have read about Air Canada's economy class comfort and service. As it transpired, it probably wasn't worth the additional expense. The seating was a plus (extra legroom plus a little extra width of seats) and this made the difference b/w no sleep and a little sleep. The first meal - a beef casserole - was very good, and served with metal cutlery etc. The next meal, in contrast, was very ordinary and served with plastic cutlery and I'm very forgiving about airline food generally. The biggest disappointment was the cheap and nasty headsets which meant that it was too unpleasant to watch any movies - the sound quality was that poor. These were flimsy single jack throwaway units used in a conjunction with a double jack fitting in the seat arm (and a loose fit at that). I didn't speak about this with other passengers but noticed that surprisingly few people had their screens turned on during the flight. Note too that I tried several different headsets on several different seats, and they all either failed to work at all or had the same poor sound quality. I've since raised this with Air Canada but their response suggested that this was a one-off equipment failure - it wasn't, those headphones could never provide acceptable sound quality. Appears to be more a case of penny-pinching by management. If they can't afford better then the very least they could do would be to recommend that passengers bring their own headsets.",24th December 2017,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Hong Kong to Vancouver,December 2017,4,3,3,1,2,0,2,['Vancouver'],1,15.0,6,2.5,-0.3,0.008249542124542129,"['hong', 'kong', 'family', 'decided', 'try', 'premium', 'economy', 'service', 'given', 'long', 'plus', 'rather', 'lacklustre', 'reviews', 'read', 'economy', 'class', 'comfort', 'service', 'transpired', 'probably', 'worth', 'additional', 'expense', 'seating', 'plus', 'extra', 'legroom', 'plus', 'little', 'extra', 'width', 'seats', 'difference', 'sleep', 'little', 'sleep', 'first', 'meal', 'beef', 'casserole', 'good', 'served', 'metal', 'cutlery', 'etc', 'meal', 'contrast', 'ordinary', 'served', 'plastic', 'cutlery', 'forgiving', 'airline', 'food', 'generally', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'cheap', 'nasty', 'headsets', 'meant', 'unpleasant', 'watch', 'movies', 'sound', 'quality', 'poor', 'flimsy', 'single', 'jack', 'throwaway', 'units', 'used', 'conjunction', 'double', 'jack', 'fitting', 'seat', 'arm', 'loose', 'fit', 'speak', 'passengers', 'noticed', 'surprisingly', 'people', 'screens', 'turned', 'note', 'tried', 'several', 'different', 'headsets', 'several', 'different', 'seats', 'either', 'failed', 'work', 'poor', 'sound', 'quality', 'since', 'raised', 'response', 'suggested', 'equipment', 'failure', 'headphones', 'never', 'provide', 'acceptable', 'sound', 'quality', 'appears', 'case', 'management', 'ca', 'afford', 'better', 'least', 'recommend', 'passengers', 'bring', 'headsets']","['cheap', 'nasty', 'headsets']",pos

appalling customer service,S Karson,TripVerified," On the 19th December I was meant to catch an AC8670 8pm flight from Vancouver to San Diego, my first time flying Air Canada. 20 mins before boarding time, we were told the flight was cancelled because the plane needed to be de-iced and would not make San Diego's 12am curfew. Fine. Then, we were told we had to go out through customs and immigration and go re-book tickets with Air Canada. The lady at the Air Canada desk was extremely rude saying that they weren't re-booking tickets there even though we'd be directed to go there - she provided essentially no customer service. Another thing - some passengers are automatically re-booked onto flights and others aren't which is super inconsistent and something I expect a budget airline to do - I wonder is Air Canada a budget airline or Canada's national carrier? Because it is a total embarrassment of a carrier. Moreover, even though I was re-booked onto a flight the next day at 8pm, I was not given any accommodation vouchers or food vouchers or anything. I received nothing in compensation.

Thanks for messing my day,Hussein Alawsi,TripVerified,"  St Johns to Houston via Toronto. My son had a game a game on Saturday December 09/2017. I have promised him that I will leave some work undone and change my flight from Sunday to Friday so that I can make it on his game on Saturday 8:00AM. I have made the change and paid the extra 524.70 $. My flight from St. John’s was delayed one hour. But was still going to make it. I have arrived to Toronto and run from the aircraft all the way to passport control which I have Global entry and that will boost the process faster. While at the passport control I still have 35 minuets and the walk to the gate is on 5 minutes. The passport control did not let me through due to my luggage was loaded off and she told me not to worry, I still have time. She said just go to the helpdesk for Air Canada which was 1 minute away. When I arrived there. I discovered that Air Canada decided to change my flight to next morning and they can’t put luggage on the plane and will not let me leave to Houston without my luggage. I have tried to explain a lot and couldn’t get them to put on that flight or any other flight that could help me to achieve my goal. And funny enough, they have told me that I was paged on my arrival gate to see if I’m going on this flight or not. This is so funny, how the heck I would know that I will be called on my arrival gate, on top of that they should’ve be expecting me running to my departure gate. They have booked me the worst hotel and have told me that I have to go to this hotel without my luggage. Normally for human being, the luggage will be needed at the hotel so that shower can be taken and changing. So they basically they don’t let me go to Houston without my luggage on the flight and would let me go to hotel without it.

I was pleasantly surprised,Cory Loughlan,TripVerified,"  Vancouver to Brisbane. Looking to move from Canada to Australia I was happy to see a direct flight to Brisbane from Air Canada. Value for a roundtrip fare was exceptional, we booked the base economy 'Tango' fare (Y) and we picked up the round trip flight on a seat sale which cost us just under $1,000 each. This included 2 checked bags each, which really helped us as we ended up checking one of our carryon bags as we didn't need it in the cabin with us. Once at the airport, boarding was quick and efficient by the staff on the ground. We boarded and were in the air about 12:20am, 5 minutes ahead of our scheduled takeoff. We were sat in row 31, seats J & K which were exit row seats, a pillow and blanket were provided at each seat. Once the seatbelt sign was turned off meal service and drinks started right away. Options for dinner were Chicken or Beef with vegetables and potatoes. I chose chicken which was average for airplane food (Picture attached). I then browsed the entertainment selection with a post dinner drink. The entertainment had 100's of different films and sitcom option, however none had appealed to me at the time and I was fairly tired so I ended up not watching anything. The best part of the flight was the seat comfort. After dinner I put some earplugs in and went to sleep. I ended up falling asleep for a good 6 hours at which time I woke up and tried the entertainment system again to no avail, at which point I fell back asleep for a few more hours. I did have an exit row which meant I did have extra legroom, however lots of people congregate there to use the washroom that is in the centre row. Even though I had the extra legroom I was not looking forward to the 15 our flight in the middle seat, however in the end I was pleasantly surprised. About 2 hours before landing the crew came around to serve breakfast. The choices were scrambled eggs with salsa or pancakes, I choose the eggs which were not great at all, I would have choose the sweeter option. (There was another service halfway thought the flight for a light snack, however I was asleep for that service). After breakfast the crew quickly cleaned up, I changed and freshened up in the washroom which was fairly standard and had ample space to change. This one was situated in the centre of the cabin however I was told the one up front in premium economy actually had a window in the washroom. A few minutes earlier than expected we had a smooth landing in Brisbane around 9:30 am, where I felt surprisingly fresh after the 15 flight and ready to take on the day.",5th December 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Brisbane,November 2017,5,5,3,4,4,0,4,"['Vancouver', 'Brisbane']",2,25.0,6,4.166666666666667,0.1,0.08088023088023089,"['looking', 'move', 'australia', 'happy', 'see', 'direct', 'value', 'roundtrip', 'fare', 'exceptional', 'booked', 'base', 'economy', 'fare', 'picked', 'round', 'trip', 'seat', 'sale', 'cost', 'included', 'checked', 'bags', 'really', 'helped', 'ended', 'checking', 'carryon', 'bags', 'need', 'cabin', 'airport', 'boarding', 'quick', 'efficient', 'staff', 'ground', 'boarded', 'minutes', 'ahead', 'scheduled', 'takeoff', 'sat', 'row', 'seats', 'j', 'k', 'exit', 'row', 'seats', 'pillow', 'blanket', 'provided', 'seat', 'seatbelt', 'sign', 'turned', 'meal', 'service', 'drinks', 'started', 'right', 'away', 'options', 'dinner', 'chicken', 'beef', 'vegetables', 'potatoes', 'chose', 'chicken', 'average', 'airplane', 'food', 'picture', 'attached', 'browsed', 'entertainment', 'selection', 'post', 'dinner', 'drink', 'entertainment', 'different', 'films', 'sitcom', 'option', 'none', 'appealed', 'time', 'fairly', 'tired', 'ended', 'watching', 'anything', 'best', 'part', 'seat', 'comfort', 'dinner', 'put', 'earplugs', 'sleep', 'ended', 'falling', 'asleep', 'good', 'hours', 'time', 'woke', 'tried', 'entertainment', 'system', 'avail', 'point', 'fell', 'back', 'asleep', 'hours', 'exit', 'row', 'meant', 'extra', 'legroom', 'lots', 'people', 'congregate', 'use', 'washroom', 'centre', 'row', 'though', 'extra', 'legroom', 'looking', 'forward', 'middle', 'seat', 'end', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'hours', 'landing', 'crew', 'came', 'around', 'serve', 'breakfast', 'choices', 'scrambled', 'eggs', 'salsa', 'pancakes', 'choose', 'eggs', 'great', 'choose', 'sweeter', 'option', 'another', 'service', 'halfway', 'thought', 'light', 'snack', 'asleep', 'service', 'breakfast', 'crew', 'quickly', 'cleaned', 'changed', 'freshened', 'washroom', 'fairly', 'standard', 'ample', 'space', 'change', 'situated', 'centre', 'cabin', 'told', 'front', 'premium', 'economy', 'actually', 'window', 'washroom', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'expected', 'smooth', 'landing', 'around', 'felt', 'surprisingly', 'fresh', 'ready', 'take', 'day']","['pleasantly', 'surprised']",pos

staff on board all very nice,L James,TripVerified," Positifs : Vols à l'heure, sièges confortables (nous avions payé pour avoir des sièges avec plus d'espace pour les jambes), personnel à bord tous très gentils. Négatifs : Les repas en vols étaient plus que médiocres. On nous a servi un bol de nouilles déshydratées avec de l'eau bouillante, un petit sandwich au jambon et deux biscuits secs pour un des repas durant le vol Toronto-Hong Kong.

Pour le souper, nous avons eu droit à un boeuf tellement gras que ce n'était pas mangeable et comme dessert, un brownies tellement sec que le manche de ma cuillère en plastique a cassé. Pour le vol Toronto-Québec (durée de vol 1 h 40), on ne nous a rien offert à manger.

Negatives: The meals in flights were more than mediocre. We were served a bowl of dehydrated noodles with boiling water, a small ham sandwich and two biscuits for one meal during the Toronto-Hong Kong flight. And on the way back, it was the same menu. For dinner, we had a beef so fat that it was not edible and as a dessert, a brownie so dry that the handle of my plastic spoon broke. For the Toronto-Quebec flight (flight time 1:40), we were not offered anything to eat. Funnily different from Bangkok Airways or Thai Airways who served us delicious meals with ""real"" utensils, even if the flights lasted only 1:30. When we compare them, it's pretty sad.

forced to pay for selecting a seat,D Cain,TripVerified,  Booked Honolulu to Ottawa via Vancouver for December. My complaint is the manner in which Air Canada has increased the price of their fares by offering reduced seat fares through travel web sites (e.g. Expedia) only to underhandedly force the purchaser to pay for selecting a seat either before or during check-in and paying for every piece of luggage. This practice is deceiving and dishonest. I have come to appreciate airlines who are forthright in their pricing practices through travel web sites and have flown many that are completely above board. It is unfortunate that we are serviced by so few airlines in Canada that this type of price gouging is allowed to continue.

we booked it with a third party,A Barden,TripVerified,"  The plane was super cramped and no food was offered unless you pay for it, including pretzels. Our return flight was a nightmare. We had to change our return date a day early (same flight route). The AC desk at the Portland airport has selective hours and no one there until 2 hours before the first flight out. So we had to wait 1.5 hours for staff to change the flight. The girl arrived and we were first in line (with a huge line up behind us). Staff said we booked it with a third party so we have to go through them to change anything. We asked if there was still room on the flights we were looking to retuning and she said yes. We asked if she could do anything for us, and if there is anything we can do to get on this flight. She said she can't help us and when we exhibited frustration from waiting over an hour and a half in line for a desk agent she said others are waiting too and you are holding them up! After an hour on the phone trying to change our flights, AC wanted $200 per ticket change fee and the price difference between flights which was over $1,400. No one was willing to do anything for us.

50% of all flights are delayed,G Danson,TripVerified,"  I have been flying Air Canada Jazz from Portland to Vancouver BC and back for the last 6 years (almost every weekend - except when I fly Alaska instead). I have been trying to fly Alaska more often. My flight is delayed again. Out of all my flights with Air Canada, almost 50% of all flights are delayed. I am wondering why that is. When Alaska has only delayed 10% at most during my 6 years going the same route. I really want Air Canada management to take a hard look at why they cannot be on time more often on the same route that Alaska does.

very good experience,Kevan Peters,VerifiedReview,"  Vancouver - London Heathrow return. Nov 1-13, 2017. Overall, very good experience. Online check-in easy and quick with very easy printing of boarding passes and luggage tags at the airport kiosks. Ground staff professional. The zone boarding process can be confusing as, even though specific zones are called, passengers from other zones tend to get into line prior to being called. Ground staff don't seem to manage this boarding process well and this is not the first trip where I've encountered this issue. Planes were clean and well kept. Onboard staff were professional and efficient. Meals were tasty, which was a vast improvement over my last international trip with AC. Vancouver - London Heathrow included 1 hot meal and a very small breakfast - a slice of gingerbread and a small yogurt. This is not sufficient for a flight almost 10 hours long. London Heathrow - Vancouver included a hot meal, mid flight snack and then a hot fajita about 1.5 hours prior to landing. Frequent drink runs both flights. Overall, onboard service was efficient and well done, but not outstanding. Seats are reasonable but not overly comfortable. Onboard entertainment system worked very well both flights and there was a good variety of TV, movies and music. The only negative comment would be that AC charges for advance seat selection on Tango fares, fares are high enough without adding this extra fee.

space is extremely cramped,J Mackay,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Philadelphia to Toronto. I would like to begin by pointing out that at the Philadelphia International airport checking for this flight was done by United airlines personnel. Up to this point I have refrained from commenting about United based on the negative press however after experiencing the checking I have to agree with everything that is being reported. The United personnel at Philadelphia Airport were extremely rude. I am a crew member for a cruise line and normally I ask to have my bags tagged ""priority"", that way they arrive at the final destination, other airlines usually have no problem doing this however the United person at the counter said to me ""No"". At one point during the conversation I had to ask if she was having a good day and then that sort of made her realize how nasty she was being. As far as the flight I do have to say that we were up in the air for about an hour and there’s really not much to comment other than the fact that I paid for the preferred seating and there is not much difference between that and regular seat. The space is extremely cramped as you will see in the photo I have attached. The flight attendants however were very nice, the plane was clean and the flight went on without any incident.

They still have room for improvement,J Mackay,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Toronto to Copenhagen. On this international flight and first time with Air Canada I have to mention that I am very impressed with the friendliness of the aircrew in general. The aircraft was beautiful and clean however I paid for extra legroom and I found myself next to an emergency door which I had no problem staying on however the seats did not have a movable armrest. I had a row of two for myself but I was not able to move the armrest because it was stationary. The seat also felt kind of narrow. I was served a hot meal, two snacks, plenty of drinks (alcohol beverages included) and a light breakfast. There was no Wi-Fi on this flight and the entertainment selection was mediocre with only a handful of movies and TV shows. I am a big fan of the Boeing 777 because it is spacious, relatively quiet and depending on the airline the amenities can be quite good.

poorly trained check-in supervisors,S Patton,VerifiedReview,"  Brisbane to San Francisco via Vancouver. What an atrocious check-in experience traveling to the US. Stay away unless you're on a visa waiver, visa, permanent resident or US citizen. The check-in supervisors have zero idea how to deal with anything else and are a combination of poorly trained, arrogant, aggressive and power tripping. Two supervisors were involved and they were both the same. They don't know that other forms of US travel authority exist (a US Advance Parole combo card in this case). They had no idea how to type the Advance Parole combo card into their computer, so just wildly guessed, with one attempt before giving up. The computer then said I wasn't cleared to fly, because they'd typed in garbage data, which they insisted was what was going to happen ""because we don't have the authority to override the system"". Instead of just saying ""I'm not sure how to process this card, let me call someone who can help me"" their *first* opening approach is to say ""we have to offload you because you don't have a visa or permanent resident card and that's what our systems require"". No attempt to solve the problem and understand. Utter aggressive refusal to let me explain what an Advance Parole card is and that I am indeed allowed to fly to the US, you just have to call someone who knows what this card is. Literally I was trying to show them my phone and get them to read a paragraph from a US government website explaining what an Advance Parole combo card was and that it grants travel authority. They refused to read it - ""I don't care what that says because we have to do what the computer says and it says to offload you"". No matter that the computer only said that because they didn't know how to type this card in! Finally they call US immigration, after about 20 minutes of telling me they are going to offload me and aggression. They keep calling the combo card an ""Employment Authorization Document"". It has that in big print along the top, and the Advance Parole part in little print along the bottom. I keep trying to explain that it's a 2-in-1 combo card and to read the sentence on the bottom when talking to US immigration. ""We know what to say"". US Immigration answers, they refuse to read the bottom of the card, calling it an Employment Authorization Document and looking at me smugly. After many minutes on the phone the person on the other end finally asks them what is on the bottom of the card and they read it out with a grimace. About 30 minutes in after countless threats of offloading and one threat of calling airport police ""because we don't like you"" I am cleared to fly. They don't say a word to me, refuse to look at me. Just pass my passport to a check-in counter worker and say ""he's cleared to fly"". The in-flight experience was great, a near new Boeing 787.

abhorrent customer service,C Racheleau,VerifiedReview,"  Vancouver to Baltimore via Toronto, and my bag went missing. I transferred planes in Toronto. I left Vancouver Oct. 3rd. My bag never showed up in Baltimore. I immediately placed a baggage claim report with an Air Canada representative at the airport (which took over an hour as their were no representatives at the kiosk and no one picked up when I called repeatedly; I had to call the 1-800 customer service hotline to get them to contact a representative at the airport). I was told they'd send my bag through to my hotel where I was staying for work for a week. My bag never turned up; I called and emailed multiple times daily to no avail. I had to purchase all new work clothing, shoes, toiletries etc. It is now more than a month later and I have home in Vancouver. Since then I've travelled on several flights for work and have several more this year. I still do not have an answer from air Canada. It has been like pulling teeth trying to get ahold of anyone that could help. My baggage number is still under ""locating"" and I have filed claims for ""delayed"" baggage as you cannot file ""lost"" status until they tell you it cannot be found. I filled my ""delayed"" claims the day I arrived home to Vancouver Oct 10th. I have made numerous calls, Facebook posts, instagram posts, twitter posts, and emails to customer service, baggage claims, and whoever else I could find to contact. And I still have ZERO answers on where my bag is, if it will be found, if I will be reimbursed. Or if I will even be reimbursed for the $50 I paid to check the luggage (the money I paid to have someone lose my bag).

We tried to file a complaint,Ken Waldroup,VerifiedReview,"  Charlotte to Gander via Toronto. I am one of 6 in our group that have the same complaints. In Charlotte, Air Canada charged us an antler/horn fee of $150 instead of a $50 firearms fee when we checked our guns for a Moose hunting trip to Newfoundland. They tried to tell us since we had rifles that we had to pay an antler/horn fee because they were hunting equipment and they no longer fall in the firearm category. We even got a TSA agent to try help us talk sense into the girls at the bag check but they wouldn't listen. Then we were told our luggage would go direct to Gander but we had to check guns in Toronto thru customs. Every person that we talked to employed by Air Canada gave us a different story concerning our guns and our luggage. In Toronto instead of bringing the guns out to us for an ID check we found them in the baggage claim area that anyone could have picked them up. Then in Toronto customs we saw all our luggage stacked in the corner that we were told would go straight to Gander. Also Toronto customs only had 2 people working the 15 check stations and 40 people were lined up for connecting flights and we barely made ours. We checked our luggage and guns again but when we got to Gander all 9 bags including our guns were lost. We missed a full day of a $4300 hunt waiting on luggage and guns. They didn't make it to the airport until the next evening. Then on the return trip home to Charlotte we were charged the correct firearm fee but we watched a girl throw our gun case on the carousel in Charlotte. Hard enough it hit and bounced almost off and another passenger caught it and placed it back on the carousel. These are very expensive guns and scopes. Also she did not bring the guns to us and check our ID to release them to us as she was supposed to. Anyone could have taken them again. We tried to file a complaint at the airport and talked to her supervisor and he said he would reprimand her as that was uncalled for but that we would have to file an online complaint. Also a brand new luggage bag came back with the handle ripped off. And the flight from Toronto to Charlotte had a problem with the fan that pressurizes the cabin so it was so hot on the plane you couldn't breath. It did get better as we flew but the pilot had to fly at a low altitude according to the flight attendants because of the cabin pressure issue.

I work hard for a living to have nice things, some of those of which I had brought on our trip.  There is no system in place and the bag never made it back home.

like flying with a different airline,Mike Palmer,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Boston return on a miles flight. Easy bag drop and security thanks to my partner being 35k elite. Pre clearance is way better since the re-configuration (well done Pearson) and I was in the lounge on a guest pass within 30 mins of entering the airport. Easy boarding and an on time flight with a swift beverage service. On time arrival and fast bags. Sadly the return flight was like flying with a different airline. We checked in 5 mins after the 1 hour cut for hold baggage off due to our ferry being late and the Water Taxi taking longer than expected. (note to self - next time, take a cab). We were denied checking in our bag due to TSA needing an hour to assess the bags. Reminding the check in staff that in May, they were happy to walk the bags through after a double cancellation the response was - that was Runway reconstruction, this is Irma). How a hurricane in the south affected an AC flight from Boston to Toronto was a mystery (other than the obvious abdication of responsibility or helping the customer). The check in staff were sympathetic but the supervisor stood her ground. We weren't allowed to travel without our bags, and the only option was to rebook. The good news was there was room on the next flight two hours later. The bad news - a 75 buck change fee each for the privilege. With no other option we re-booked though they were kind enough to tag our bags as priority. Boarding was efficient but the AC gate area at Boston is in the running for the most cramped and soulness departure gates on the AC network.

On board the aircraft looked tired,T Eldem,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to St. John's on Embraer 175. Check in was quick and hassle free.

On board the aircraft looked tired. My wife's IFE screen did not work as the tactile function had to be recalibrated. This resulted in no IFE for her for the entire flight. Similarly, my son's headphone jack was broken and my screen had multiple scratches all over it. The FA's bordered on surly and went about their duties as if they were doing us a favour.

new pathway thru customs,B Sachin,VerifiedReview,"  La Guardia to Halifax via Montreal. Thank you Air Canada for instituting this new (since November) pathway thru customs in Montreal to connecting flights!

This saves so much time when one may have only a minimal amount of time to make a connecting flight, especially given regular delays! It is so much better, and truly customer-centred.

failed to provide wheelchairs,S Hauravan,VerifiedReview,"  Saskatoon to Toronto. If you are in Canada and want to fly, you lack options! Only Air Canada and WestJet. I flew to India in April and May this year. While coming back to Canada I had my parents with me and because of their old age and my father's nerve problem in his feet, I asked for a wheelchair facility for both. They failed to provide wheelchairs both in Delhi and in Toronto. I filed a complain and after that they gave me a CAD 400 discount on my next booking. So, I booked flights for three of us to go to Toronto (return ticket). Don't take me wrong. Air Canada on international routes is pretty good. The crew are helpful and food is good. Good entertainment options! Legroom is small but its economy! However, their domestic route flights are the worst I have seen.

A slightly delayed flight was thoroughly explained over the PA twice and the cabin staff was very pleasant in their service, getting the drinks going right away and answering my 'call flight attendant' ring within seconds.

cabin staff were professional,P Chen,VerifiedReview,"  I was looking forward to this trip from Los Angeles to Taipei via Vancouver. The flight from Los Angeles to Vancouver was on a newer A330. Each seat had its own personal entertainment system, and meal service included dinner and light snacks. The flight to Taipei did not depart until the next morning so I spent the night at a hotel close to Vancouver Airport (Pacific Gateway which also has a free shuttle between the airport and hotel). The flight from Vancouver to Taipei was on a Boeing 787, seat configuration was 3-3-3. Sat in economy. Unfortunately the room between my seat and the row ahead was very limited. I'm 5 foot 10 inches (about 170 cm) and even without the seat in front of me not reclining, my knees was making contact with the seat back pocket and it contents. Needless to say this made for a very uncomfortable 12 hour flight. The cabin could've used a deep cleaning as I was siting by the window and noticed all the dust bunnies clumped up on the side vents above me. The cabin staff were professional and could not be faulted. On the return flight I paid extra to sit in the bulkhead section (Approximately $60 Canadian). This made all the difference in terms of seat comfort. The cabin staff were also professional. All cabin announcements were made in 3 languages: English, French, and Chinese-Mandarin. At Vancouver Airport, all US bound passengers go through US customs and immigration checks inside Vancouver Airport--so when the flight arrives stateside, I was able to pick up my luggage in domestic arrivals which was a plus. The final leg from Vancouver to Los Angeles was operated by United. Anyone who has flown Eva Air to Taiwan might not be impressed with the Air Canada flight experience, but the price was very competitive when compared to the other airlines that fly between Los Angeles and Taiwan. I would consider flying with Air Canada in the future.",24th August 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Taipei via Vancouver,July 2017,3,5,3,5,5,0,5,"['Los Angeles', 'Taipei', 'Vancouver']",3,26.0,6,4.333333333333333,0.1,0.06415343915343916,"['looking', 'forward', 'trip', 'los', 'angeles', 'via', 'los', 'angeles', 'newer', 'seat', 'personal', 'entertainment', 'system', 'meal', 'service', 'included', 'dinner', 'light', 'snacks', 'depart', 'morning', 'spent', 'night', 'hotel', 'close', 'airport', 'pacific', 'gateway', 'free', 'shuttle', 'airport', 'hotel', 'boeing', 'seat', 'configuration', 'sat', 'economy', 'unfortunately', 'room', 'seat', 'row', 'ahead', 'limited', 'foot', 'inches', 'cm', 'seat', 'front', 'reclining', 'knees', 'making', 'contact', 'seat', 'back', 'pocket', 'contents', 'needless', 'uncomfortable', 'hour', 'cabin', 'used', 'deep', 'cleaning', 'siting', 'window', 'noticed', 'dust', 'bunnies', 'clumped', 'side', 'vents', 'cabin', 'staff', 'professional', 'faulted', 'return', 'paid', 'extra', 'sit', 'bulkhead', 'section', 'approximately', 'canadian', 'difference', 'terms', 'seat', 'comfort', 'cabin', 'staff', 'professional', 'cabin', 'announcements', 'languages', 'english', 'french', 'airport', 'bound', 'passengers', 'customs', 'immigration', 'checks', 'inside', 'airport', 'arrives', 'stateside', 'able', 'pick', 'luggage', 'domestic', 'arrivals', 'plus', 'final', 'leg', 'los', 'angeles', 'operated', 'united', 'anyone', 'flown', 'eva', 'taiwan', 'might', 'impressed', 'experience', 'price', 'competitive', 'compared', 'airlines', 'fly', 'los', 'angeles', 'taiwan', 'consider', 'flying', 'future']","['cabin', 'staff', 'professional']",pos
airline just handled everything very poorly,C Kemp,VerifiedReview,"  Had a horrible experience with Air Canada (and unfortunately not the first). Upon check-in, the lady at the counter informed me the flight was departing on time as scheduled. Thirty minutes later, the first first delay alerts started to come in. Initially, it was a three hour delay, that became 5hr 15min, eventually it settled at a delay of 4hr and 45 minutes. There was no explanation at all given as to the delay, just told to sit and wait. Time went by, and at around 11pm, the airline's lounge started to broadcast that they were closing. With this flight and several other flights of Air Canada delayed by several hours (one delayed by 6 hours), you would think the airline had the courtesy of keeping the lounge open longer in these exceptional circumstances to accommodate the premium passengers and frequent fliers. Finally, it was time to board, and the boarding area was already full of passengers impatient to board the long-delayed flight. Suddenly, the ground staff came on the intercom and announced that the flight would be ""delayed"" until late afternoon of the next day, a ""delay"" of 21hrs. People were obviously very upset and there was chaos. The ground staff tried their best to calm nerves and frustrations, but the worst was the lack of news, lack of updates and lack of announcements what passengers were entitled to during the flight waiting period. As for the cancellation, they announced that they are not in a position to book hotels for people (not even to offer discount vouchers), so hundreds of people had to go off on their own at 1am! Really unfortunate turn of events (not even sure what happened), but the airline just handled everything very poorly with lack of information and lack of compensation or regard for the wellbeing of passengers.",24th August 2017,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Amsterdam,August 2017,3,3,0,0,2,0,2,"['Toronto', 'Amsterdam']",2,10.0,4,2.5,-0.52,0.045246913580246906,"['horrible', 'experience', 'unfortunately', 'first', 'upon', 'lady', 'counter', 'informed', 'departing', 'time', 'scheduled', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'later', 'first', 'first', 'delay', 'alerts', 'started', 'come', 'initially', 'three', 'hour', 'delay', 'became', 'eventually', 'settled', 'delay', 'minutes', 'explanation', 'given', 'delay', 'told', 'sit', 'wait', 'time', 'around', 'airline', 'lounge', 'started', 'broadcast', 'closing', 'several', 'delayed', 'several', 'hours', 'delayed', 'hours', 'think', 'airline', 'courtesy', 'keeping', 'lounge', 'open', 'longer', 'exceptional', 'circumstances', 'accommodate', 'premium', 'passengers', 'frequent', 'fliers', 'finally', 'time', 'board', 'boarding', 'area', 'already', 'full', 'passengers', 'impatient', 'board', 'suddenly', 'ground', 'staff', 'came', 'intercom', 'announced', 'delayed', 'late', 'afternoon', 'day', 'delay', 'people', 'obviously', 'upset', 'chaos', 'ground', 'staff', 'tried', 'best', 'calm', 'nerves', 'frustrations', 'worst', 'lack', 'news', 'lack', 'updates', 'lack', 'announcements', 'passengers', 'entitled', 'waiting', 'period', 'cancellation', 'announced', 'position', 'book', 'hotels', 'people', 'offer', 'discount', 'vouchers', 'hundreds', 'people', 'really', 'unfortunate', 'turn', 'events', 'sure', 'happened', 'airline', 'handled', 'everything', 'poorly', 'lack', 'information', 'lack', 'compensation', 'regard', 'wellbeing', 'passengers']","['airline', 'handled', 'everything', 'poorly']",pos
Absolutely horrible customer service,F Andrews,VerifiedReview,"  
My partner and I were returning from a trip from Asia, a 15 hour flight. We were to get a connecting flight in EWR with Air Canada and return to YYZ at 6pm. We made it to EWR with plenty of time to spare and as we were in line to check our baggage, we get a notification that the flight had been cancelled with no further information. There was an AC employee in the area and we asked her about the cancelled flight, she mentioned in passing that the flight got cancelled all the time but we needed to stand in the assistance line to figure out what to do next. We got in line and there was only one rep dealing with an entire cancelled flight. One would think that if a flight gets cancelled, the company would bring on more staff. So, after waiting in line for nearly 2 hours, mind you there were only 4 or 5 people ahead of us, we finally got to the rep, who was incredibly dismissive and borderline rude to us. We were told that because of weather, the flight was cancelled, no other information other than that. I can accept weather can cancel a flight but based on our experiences and the information I found, I suspect we were being lied to. I asked if there was any other information and all I got was a blunt 'No'. All they could do would be to put us on standby for a flight at 9.35pm and we would have no idea if we could get on that or not. If that failed, the next flight we could be on was 8.35am the next day. When I asked if there were any other airlines that AC could put us on, a blunt 'No'. When I asked if AC would put us up in a hotel, another blunt 'No'. When asked if there was any compensation, he blurted out 'nope' in almost a happy way. Absolutely horrible customer service. My partner has priority pass, so we thought we could wait in the AC lounge. We showed up at the lounge, tried to get in, the rep there informed us in a way that he almost seemed to take pleasure from, that the lounge was only open to priority pass members until 3pm. The next flight, ended up getting delayed, we asked the rep at the counter a couple times if there was any status on the standby list, the last time we asked, which was close to 11pm, they told us they would tell us in two minutes, 30 seconds later they called out at list of names, didn't explain what it was and left us completely in the dark. It turns out that everybody that was on standby, except for us got a seat on the plan. When I went up to ask what was going on, they told me that the plane was full, maybe, just maybe if we waited a little while longer, we might be able to get on. It turns out there was another couple waiting on standby that had already been bumped 4 times before us that day. We waited until probably around 11.30pm. The rep found that two people hadn't checked in so we did have seats! He rushed us on board and we got into the first two seats that were available, they happened to be in business class. They seemed a bit confused at first and then realised that the tickets were for seats in economy, the first rep told us not to worry about it but then this horribly unfriendly flight attendant came up to us and told us that we we would have to move. We said okay, grabbed our belongings quickly and started to look for our seats, at this time the flight attendant yells out at us 'just take your seat, we'll sort it out in the air' - well that's great, she is the one that forced us to move, meanwhile embarrassing us in front of everybody in the plane.

!whole experience was below average,R Allen,VerifiedReview," I generally write reviews when I feel like there is a reason to commend or perhaps criticize an airline. Today I regretfully flew with Air Canada again from Vancouver to Montreal. We arrived 90 min prior to our domestic flight. The lines were especially long, and most kiosks for check in were busy. I went ahead to check us in and unsuccessfully an error receipt came out. I was forced to go into the check in line which had a wait time of 35 min. We got to the front of the line and found out that the flight was over booked and they wanted to put us on the next flight out. I was livid - how could they overbook the flight that we paid for? The Air Canada representative also had the audacity to mention that we were running late. After I firmly mentioned that I cannot get on the next flight, they magically found two seats right by one another. A miracle really. On my way from Montreal to Vancouver, I also did not have a pleasant experience. I had one carry on luggage. The front desk staff at the gate came specifically to me and asked to check it in for no charge because they had a full flight, and not enough space for the carry on luggage. I had some personal belongings that I wanted to carry on board, and in addition, I wanted to forego waiting for the checked in baggage to arrive in Vancouver.

Sloppy customer service,K Johnson,VerifiedReview,  I'm extremely disappointed with the quality and customer service of Air Canada. My flight from Toronto to LaGuardia was delayed because of a thunder storm and we waited for hours. Eventually the call was made that the flight was to be rescheduled. Everyone de-boarded the flight and after much confusion and racing back and forth through the airport to the customer service desk 3 times we all had to reboard the plane.

change was poorly communicated,R Starmer,VerifiedReview,"  Calgary to Havana via Toronto, with a 2 hour stopover in Toronto. Air Canada changed the second leg of the flight to the next day, creating a 26 hour layover. This change was poorly communicated, with only a single email consisting of an attached PDF file with two digits changed in the entire document. Air Canada did not request consent for this change, offer alternatives, or confirm my understanding of the change. I contacted Air Canada to rectify this, and they were able to change the first portion of the flight so that both flights were on the same day, as originally booked. However, they charged a $75 fee for this, without informing me that they would do so. When I attempted to discuss this with their customer service line, I was informed that I could not speak to anyone about this.

enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants,Samy-George Salib,VerifiedReview,"  I understand all of the negative reviews regarding the seat layout of 3-4-3. However, I recognize that the flight crew have no control over this. However, what I don't get is the enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants that constantly bump into aisle seat passengers as they move up and down the cabin. Facts: 1) Took AC5 from Toronto to Tokyo with my family on July 2nd, 2017. Returned on from Tokyo to Toronto on Flight AC6 - July 23rd, 2017. Both times we were seated in Aisle 41. My two kids had the window and centre seats, my wife had the aisle seat next to them, and I had the aisle next to my wife's, as we were divided by the pathway that people take up and down the cabin. 2) My elbow rested on the armrest no different than any other passengers in the cabin. To ensure true obectivity, my body size, position and posture made absoltutey no difference, as (when the issue persisted) I studied in depth whether or not I may have been the problem. My findings were that my shoulder, arm and elbow did not extend beyond the armrest as much as a millimeter further than any of the other passengers seated in the first few rows ahead, as well as behind me. 3) I cannot count the exact amount of times when the attendants banged into me when they walked past, either with or without their walking carts - forwards or backwards. What I can tell you however, is that it occurred about 15-20 times on both flights. In fact, there may have been only about 3 occasions where I no contact was made when they walking by. Some of the incidents involved them ""brushing"" along me - easily enough to wake someone uo who is sleeping. Other incidents were downright collisions - where their buttocks banged into my arm as they walked in reversed with their carts. Passengers going to and from the washroom managed to avoid these incidents. 4) Not one apology or even acknowledgement that they banged into me, or my wife, or two other passengers in the rows ahead of us that were equally annoyed. I can't speak further passengers throughout the cabin. No effort was made by the attendants to exercise the slightest bit of caution or consideration towards me, my wife and two other passengers (one being a petite female - no more than 110 pounds). There is no possible way the attendants could not feel the sensation of colliding with other passengers, yet they clearly chose not to react or respond. It's as if they have given up due to the narrow walkway layout they have been given to work with, and are almost making a statement that there was nothing that could be done about it. 4) During our vacation, we took four domestic flights within Japan via ANA Airlines. The walking path provided to their flight attendants differed minimally (if at all), yet their crew managed to make every effort to not disturb their passengers as they made their way up and down the aisles throughout the flights. In fact, there were no incidents. Their standards were much higher, and they truly went the extra mile to ensure that passengers were comfortable and well taken care of. 5) I'm a reasonable person and don't feel the need ""Go to town"" on every ratable indicator about my flight experience (i.e. food, seat comfort, in-flight entertainment), but the lack of care, effort and empathy regarding this particular matter was enough to turn me off from this airline.

major disappointment,T Reynolds,VerifiedReview," I recently flew Air Canada business class from NYC LGA to Toronto YYZ. Granted this is a short flight of about 1.5 hours but I expected more from a global airline such as this. Generally, I don't rush to board early because my luggage is usually checked. Also, boarding early just means I have to sit and wait longer as everyone slowly boards the plane and settles into their seats. Air Canada groups zones 1 and 2 together for one queue and 3 and 4 together in the other queue. Needless to say, this is very inefficient and confusing because people in zone 2 are standing on the line (early, mind you) waiting to board mixed in with zone 1 (business class) passengers. When they started boarding, some people just stood there and didn't move. That's because they were zone 2. So zone 1 passengers had to ask the person in front of them if they were moving or not and then proceed to walk ahead of them if they were zone 2. The boarding process is very backwards and makes no sense. After about 15 minutes, I was ready to board. The gate agent scanning tickets of passengers had his back to the queues. Which meant he would not see me if I walked up to the zone 1 and 2 queue. So I wound up standing in line with the zone 3 and 4 passengers. On other airlines, I would be able to walk right up and the gate agents would see me and take me right away because they would be facing the queues. Once onboard, I took my seat. And waited at least 10 minutes before a flight attendant asked me if I wanted something to drink. The FA working the business class section was standing by the door and greeting passengers with another FA, completely oblivious to the fact that I had just taken the last seat in business class. Shouldn't her focus be on the business class passengers? For this short trip, all they offered was a ""snack"" consisting of a slice of cheese and various cold cut meats. The flight departed at 11:05 am and was expected to land at 12:40 pm. I was expecting some kind of a light lunch, not light snack. The return flight was a complete mess whereby they checked me in ""so quickly"" that the systems didn't have enough time to catch up with the immigration system. Being a Global Entry customer, I was turned away by a US Immigrations Officer and asked to go sit in a waiting area so that my flight check in information would ""catch up"" with the other systems. I sat in this room nearby waiting for my name to pop up on a screen. It never happened because an Air Canada employee who directed me to this room remembered me and asked to see my ticket. I gave it to her and she scanned it on one of their machines. And I was cleared. If she hadn't walked into that room, I would've sat there waiting for my name to pop up on some screen and wasted more time! I was considering Air Canada for future Asian and / or European trips but after experiencing this, I am not flying them ever again.

With comfortable seats, a nice selection of the latest movies and TV shows, and decent airline food, I would pick this over airlines like United Airlines any day. Also, the plane did an amazing and efficient job at letting the passengers out the plane. The only complaints I had were rather minor, one being that whenever the crew announced something, they would do it in 3 different languages, meaning you had to wait 3 times as long for your movie to play again, and also Canada's inefficient system of transferring layovers for people going to the US.

connecting flight was canceled,L Reece,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Detroit. After a red eye from Calgary to Toronto, the connecting flight to Detroit orginially scheduled for 8:50 AM was canceled. I was told to go to the Air Canada service desk where, understandably, at 5:30 in the morning, they were understaffed. When I was sent to another desk and finally helped, I had been rebooked for a flight to Detroit two days later. Thankfully the worker continued to check and found a 5 PM flight on the same day. I was given $20 in vouchers (which I now know over a 12 hour time span can be spent very quickly). When it was time to leave, there was an announcement made that our flight attendant could not be found and therefore we did not know our new time of departure.

enjoyed the service in premium economy,John Peters,VerifiedReview," Our flight from Copenhagen to Toronto left and arrived on time. My wife and I enjoyed the service in the premium economy cabin which consists of only three rows. The premium economy class entitles one to priority boarding and baggage.

AC also provided very obliging service when we needed to change our connecting flight to Calgary.

"consistent service, polite crew/attendants",D Henderson,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Calgary. Great flight on a clean 787 aircraft in economy. Very friendly attendants: I was sitting beside a couple that was ignoring every instruction.

Due to a misunderstanding of when we were landing, I tried to order some food close to landing time. The attendant in my section was polite, explained that they weren't supposed to take any more orders, but then gave me a free sandwich (worth around $6.50 on this domestic flight) to give me the benefit of the doubt.

do not respond to call signs at all,S Kitts,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Toronto (YYZ) to Mumbai (BOM) with Air Canada. The experience was very decent and it had slightly surpassed my expectations.

However, like my previous experience with Air Canada, the cabin crew do not respond to call signs at all. Regarding meal service, they were quite delicious and well-presented.

I was served three meals throughout the flight, which included a dinner, snack, and breakfast service. Although there was a limited selection of movies and other forms of in-flight entertainment, I surprisingly did not feel bored during the course of the flight. Flight was certainly eventful. The seat was comfortable with for the long journey with excellent legroom, though the seat recline was not as good as other premium economy classes I have travelled in. Moreover, during the whole flight it was really cold and for a while, after the dinner service, when people are generally sleeping, the main light was still on, which was very disturbing.

don't fly with Air Canada ,R Wilcox,VerifiedReview,"  Tokyo to Denver via Vancouver. Tokyo to Vancouver was an uneventful flight as you want flights to be. I have no issues with the plane or service on that flight. My issue came in trying to go from Vancouver to Denver. At the last minute Air Canada cancelled our flight. Okay fine. Things happen. (There was no issue with weather in this case.) I'm not upset that the flight was cancelled. I'm upset at how it was handled by airline representatives. First of all, there is no customer service counter for the airline in this part of Vancouver airport, so the entire flight is waiting in a giant line for a mere two representatives to help us rebook. Second, they start handing out a phone number because they said it was faster for us to rebook if we called this number. This is true, and I did call. However, why are they making already frazzled customers do this? Shouldn't they just employ enough agents to handle this sort of thing? As a side note, when I called the number the woman on the phone was very nice and helpful and took the time to answer all my questions.  Third, did my rebooking over the phone, and the agent was very helpful. However, she can't issue me a boarding pass or check me in over the phone. I have to see an agent. She assured me that my baggage would follow me, perhaps not on that same flight, but eventually. I'm on my way home, so I'm okay with this. Fourth, I try to see said agent. If I can get a new boarding pass with enough time, perhaps I can get go get my baggage and get it retagged myself. I have no such luck. I can find 3 Air Canada reps in the entire airport (or at least the part I have access to without going through US customs again.) All 3 are trying to help with rebooking. I wait in line while my husband wanders the airport looking for a person or a kiosk or anything. He finds nothing.  This is where my issue is. The woman trying to rebook everyone literally will not even let me finish a sentence. She says I have to go get my baggage and go through customs again with it retagged. When I tell her that the agent told me over the phone that I would not have to do this, she rolls her eyes and prints me one boarding pass. I need two boarding passes. You see, our new flight was from Vancouver to Seattle and then from Seattle to Denver. The final Seattle to Denver leg was on another airline. She refuses to print me that boarding pass and sends me away with a wave of her hand and will not answer any more questions.  I go to the gate where we are supposed to take off from Vancouver to Seattle. This agent also will not print me another boarding pass. Here's how that exchange went Me: I was wondering if you could print me a boarding - Agent: No. The flight has been downgraded. I don't know if you have a seat. Me: Okay well - Agent: Sit down and I'll page you. (Not sure how she was going to page me without asking my name but what do I know right?) She pages customers being bumped to the next flight. They are unhappy naturally. She is just as snippy with them, not letting anyone finish a sentence. We do make the flight and eventually get home over 6 hours late. We have no bags. Of course there is no Air Canada representative in the Denver airport to speak with. Our final leg was on Alaska Air. I make a lost baggage report with them.

very good quality,S Palleno,VerifiedReview,"  Vancouver to Toronto on Air Canada's Boeing 787-9, surpassed my expectations and did very well in good service and very good quality. In the process of boarding, was invited to visit the cockpit, in which the pilots greeted me very nicely and we had a nice conversation. The take-off role was very smooth.  Once in the air, I ordered a Pizza from the onboard menu, and it tasted great. In-Flight-entertainment screen worked great,very responsive and had a good selection of movies, TV shows, Documentaries, and more. The seats were very comfortable and the cabin was in excellent condition; very clean and neatly organized. The crew was friendly.

never recommend Air Canada,E Dawson,VerifiedReview,"  Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. At the start of our journey we were rudely treated at the check in desk over carry on size luggage. We had recently flew Air Canada earlier in the week with the exact same size carry on pieces and now all of the sudden they were too big to travel with. We showed the check in desk lady that clearly it was an airline standardized measurement and that they fit. She gave us a hard time and eventually allowed us to take them on and not have to check them. When we got on the plane, there was more than enough space for the carry on pieces. People were bringing larger bags on than we had. It was outrageous!  Our flight was delayed by 2 hours and we did not even get an email update.

was the worst flight,G Lester,VerifiedReview,"  I was due to travel from Cleveland to Manchester via Toronto. The Cleveland flight was delayed due to technical difficulties. This meant that I was unable to make my transfer in Toronto and would need to find alternatives. There were no Air Canada staff to be found, only harassed United Airlines who code carry with them. No one could give advice, answers or assurances. After 3 hours we were allowed onto the plane. It was a blisteringly hot day and we were sat in a full, tiny plane in the heat with no air con and no ventilation for 20 mins. People in the cabin were beginning to panic - the crew gave vague assurances that things would eventually get cooler. By this point, I too was beginning to panic, feeling distressed and unable to catch my breath. When the plane took off, it cooled down slightly. What followed was an hour of complete hell - the pilots announcements were inaudible. This was the worst flight I have experienced in 40 years of flying. The cabin was dirty, cramped, the young woman serving us was indifferent and I could not wait to get off. I was then transfer via Dublin on an Air Canada Rouge flight, (think Easyjet without the cherry staff) - arriving 8 hours later than planned and without any luggage (it still hasn't arrived) At no time during this process did I feel of any significance to Air Canada - no friendly advice, no offers of help.

seats were hard and uncomfortable,M Morrison,VerifiedReview,"  I normally fly BA to Europe, but since their service has apparently gone sharply downhill as of this year (their catering has virtually disappeared and their reviews here on Skytrax are truly appalling), I thought I'd try Air Canada again. Flew from Toronto to London Heathrow / Geneva. The check-in/bag drop at Pearson was terrible. I arrived 2.5 hours before the flight and there was a long line that barely moved. It took an hour before I got to a desk. Typical case of lots of desks available but less than half were being used. Not acceptable for a full long-haul flight. The aircraft to London was a B777. I knew that AC had reconfigured these planes to squeeze 10 instead of the previous 9 seats per row. And I'd heard that the seats were hard and uncomfortable. And they are! Fortunately the seat next to me was free, but even so, it was pretty tight and I could not get comfortable all night. AC uses these aircraft on 16-hour flights to Asia and Australia, which must be unbearable. However, the IFE system is modern with an excellent selection of movies/entertainment, and good screen quality. The catering is standard and decent enough, certainly better than AC Rouge, BA or Air Transat these days. Lots of water runs throughout the flight, which were appreciated. My return flight was from Geneva on an older A330. Overall this was a good thing: the seats were wider and more comfortable, with proper cushioning and excellent leg-room. The IFE system was dated, though, and the selection not as good, but still adequate. The catering was again decent enough. All in all I would fly Air Canada again to Europe for direct flights.

awful staff in Rome,C Lassara,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Rome. The Air Canada staff at the Toronto Airport were very friendly, professional and very competent. It was very easy to check in and get loaded on the aircraft. Unfortunately things started going downhill after that. The aircraft was freezing cold. They had the a/c on high for some unknown reason. Even after many people complained, one of the cabin crew claimed they turned up the temperature by a couple of degrees. It was still as cold. Everyone was glad to get off the plane in the morning and warm up.  Air Canada staff in Rome are rude, impatient, unfriendly and incompetent at best. They act like you are bothering them at the check in counter and after our flight home was cancelled, you cannot make up just how incompetently they mishandled the situation. I'm not talking about just 1 person. It was pretty much all of them. Their communication was awful as to getting our bags back. The passengers were basically left to fend for themselves to find their bags since we were all sent to the wrong turnstile. Then Air Canada sent someone with the voice of a mouse to give instructions on who goes to what hotel. This almost turned into a riot since almost no one could hear or understand. The employee seemed to have no idea what she was doing and gave terrible instructions as to which hotels and where to find the shuttle buses. There was no organization whatsoever from the Air Canada staff. It really was the incompetent leading the incapable. It took the airport police who were wonderful to get us to the hotel. Air Canada could care less. The next morning, we were right back to the rude, impatient treatment at the check in counter with a different person and disorganizion at the gate since we had to be bused to the plane. Everyone was thrilled to get away from the Air Canada Rome staff once they were on the plane. We must give credit to the cabin crew however for the return flight. Although this aircraft was almost as cold, the staff couldn't do enough for everyone. They were kind and professional. The wonderful Air Canada staff in Toronto guided us to Customs and we got all our bags.

losing our baggage,G Lane,VerifiedReview,"  San Francisco to London via Toronto. Flights coming back: smooth, and well done. Flight going to London - it's been over two weeks since I first addressed everything that went wrong, including missing flights, being bumped to different flights, them losing our baggage, and their support team literally says an agent has up to 30 days for a response.  The flight that left on May 10th was late. About 45 minutes late out of SFO (San Francisco). This ended up making us late for the connection flight in Toronto. When we got to the gate we were informed that we had been removed from the connection flight because we hadn’t checked in. Of course we hadn’t checked in, because the original flight Air Canada had us on was late. So we tried to get back on the original flight. Luckily they got us on. However, they had already moved our bags to the following flight leaving out of Toronto. So they had to move our bags back. They said they would get a runner to do it. Fair enough. When we landed in LHR (London), they didn’t have our bags. We went to the baggage claim desk for Air Canada. They said they had no scans on our bags and had no idea where they were. They asked us to file a claim and track it through your World Tracer program. This trip was becoming a nightmare. Because the flight was delayed in Toronto the flight to LHR landed late. This made us miss our original flight to Munich that we had made on Lufthansa. We went to the Lufthansa desk who said it would be $271.00 for each of us to get a new flight. Still no update on the baggage tracer. Kept calling their baggage claim desk, and they said the bags hadn’t arrived on the recent flight coming in from Toronto. We ended up needing to book new flight with a completely different airline much later in the day. This time directly to Salzburg (our eventual location) coming out of LGW (Gatwick). Total price for the two flights: $293.40. As we were about to leave LHR to head to Gatwick, we got a call from baggage claim. They had our bags. Their World Tracer, which they kept pointing us to for more information which showed absolutely no updates, never showed the bags delivered. In fact, it STILL doesn't show the bags reached us and it's been over two weeks if you can believe it. So…where do we stand? They causes us to miss their own connection flight in Toronto. They caused us to miss our Lufthansa flight to Munich (and we had provided plenty of time from arrival in London to departure for the next flight). They screwed up delivery of our bags (they still haven't officially confirmed us receiving our bags, that's how TERRIBLE their bag tracer is). And yup. I contacted their support team. Nothing. Absolutely NOTHING has been done since we've gotten back from London. They just keep saying the same thing over and over again: a support agent is looking into your case and will respond within 30 days. I am never flying with them again. While some of their agents and staff do a great job, part of their team is absolutely incompetent, has zero sympathy for nightmares like this, and their support team is practically unreachable unless you plan to wait 45 minutes on the phone for one of them to answer, or you want to go through online channels, where they have up to 30 days to get back to you.

the sub-par product,M Coram,VerifiedReview,"  Brussels to Toronto via Montreal. Having sampled Premium economy on Air France on a trip to Paris last year and having had an excellent experience, I was truly disappointed at the sub-par product Air Canada offers in comparison to the return trip I just took to Brussels from Montreal. I flew on an A330. The seat comfort is mediocre with little space to manoeuvre and if the person in front of you decides to recline their chair, it's game over. Sleep was impossible because of malfunctioning closet door near the galley that kept opening in spite of the attendant's very noisy attempts to close it permanently. On the outbound I was served a veal stew which was ok though truthfully it could have been any meat thanks to the heavy sauce. Breakfast was literally a slice of grey bread wrapped in plastic which I declined. Out of Brussels, nothing is more infuriating than sitting in a half empty Premium economy cabin (AC833 27/5/17) after having been told that the flight was full (both economy cabins evidenced many empty seats after take-off) and being told before take-off that your food choice is no longer available thereby compromising the principle of not getting what you pay for. After complaining to the flight director who was charming but useless and mouthing platitudes that she would write it up in her report, I braced myself for the arrival of the pasta dish that no one else wanted and that I was going to be saddled with, unless I wanted to be hungry for the next seven hours. It arrives, the foil is removed and it is dry at the edges. I to eat the bun and lettuce with six small slices of red pepper. The dessert is artificially creamy with peach bits that has some pleasant taste but which hardly provides fulfilling sustainment. An hour before landing we are served a savoury pastry in a cardboard box. Mine is a Chicken Fajita.

Stranded at Pearson International,Eugene Borokhovski,VerifiedReview,"  Stranded at Pearson International (Toronto) because of our 5-hour delayed flight from San Antonio, we (at least 14 passengers with connections to Montreal and Ottawa) had a very unpleasant experience with Air Canada there. Its personnel at the connection desk offered us no apologies, no options for accomodation and no compensation, but instead lectured us with apparent agitation, even aggression, for being ungrateful daring to question their ""hospitality"". We spent the entire night on the floor of the airport where its administration ""generously"" provided prison-style blankets. Complaints to AC customer relations department resulted in an offer of 25% discount for the next flight off so-called ""base fair"", which (when applied), is still roughly 10-15% percent more expensive than what you could easily find on any consolidator website.

We found out the flight was cancelled at 2pm that day due to construction at the Toronto Airport. It was ridiculous for them to find out that late that construction would be occurring at that terminal.

I was expecting hotel to be covered but unfortunately it was not technically their fault. They also neglected to tell us that technically the Air Canada ticket counter was closed until 4a.m. So we had to ""sleep"" in the outer lobby where any one could have access to steal our stuff.

passed from desk to desk,H Jenkins,VerifiedReview,"  
Air Canada is easily able to provide one of the worst experiences to travellers of any airline. Their inability to manage delays and cancellations astounds me since it's such a regular thing for them. Yesterday most of their domestic flights from Toronto were cancelled due to a known outage of one runway, and most of their international flights were delayed. Despite knowing this it was chaos. I was incorrectly passed from desk to desk when I arrived late to a cancelled flight. Each person sent me to someone else or lied to me. Eventually I ended up outside of security with no luggage, no transport to my destination no luggage and no one who could give me any help or information. Every agent I dealt with lied to me to get me to go away and there was no joined up process for dealing with numeesous stranded passengers. The only helpful person was the woman at the delayed baggage call centre who had empathy, knowledge and genuinely helped me try to resolve my situation. Never again Air Canada!

Air Canada's horrible service,D Pan,VerifiedReview,"  Honolulu to Deer Lake via Vancouver. My family's wonderful Hawaii trip had a very upsetting ending due to Air Canada's horrible service. We endured multiple flight delays and cancellations due to technical issues with their planes and had to pay for three hotel rooms out of pocket to accommodate our 8-month old baby and my elderly parents who would have been stranded overnight in two separate cities. It took us 2+ days to get back home (instead of the scheduled 23 hours). Our returning flight AC1830 was delayed due to technical issues. We found out about the delay when we arrived at the airport around 7:00 pm (no previous warning) and the departure was initially postponed from 10:00 pm to 3:45 am but got delayed again to 4:15 am early in the morning. AC told us that since they didn't cancel the flight they were not responsible to book us a hotel room despite the fact that we had an infant and two seniors travelling with us. I couldn't understand how AC expected families with small children and babies to deal with this - sleep on the airport floor? We decided to book a hotel room on our own since we have 20+ hours flight ahead of us and an infant baby travelling with us. A motel room with airport shuttle cost us $200+tax USD/room due to the last minute booking. AC did postpone the departure again from 3:45 to 4:15 am. Neither my husband nor I was able to sleep well as we were afraid to miss our flight. This was only the beginning of our horrible experience. We were supposed to have two connecting flights after arriving in Vancouver (VAN-TOR, TOR-DL). Due to this first delay, AC had to cancel our subsequent flights and rebook the rest of our trip. Instead of flying to Deer Lake on the same night we arrived in Toronto, we had to stay in Toronto overnight. However, AC couldn't give us the rest of our boarding passes, nor could it book a hotel in Toronto for us. The agent in Honolulu told us that we needed to get the hotel from AC's customer service in Toronto once we got there. AC's flight from Vancouver to Toronto got delayed again and the plane did not land in Toronto airport until 10:45 pm on May 2nd. By the time we got off the plane it was almost 11:30pm. There were 50+ people in line at the AC customer service kiosk, while only two to three agents were working. The line hardly moved and after midnight an agent came to the line telling us all the hotels around the airport were sold out and we had to look for hotels on our own. He said the desk would be closing in 30 minutes and the agents would leave despite there were still so many of us unserved. He told us to call AC to rebook our flights. He also told us to find hotel on our own; and AC will reimburse up to $100 CAD per room. Seriously, I want to ask AC where to find a hotel room cost $100 or less nowadays?? As we learned that we wouldn't be helped by anyone at the desk, my husband started to call AC about our booking and I started looking for hotel rooms for us since we were all exhausted and I did not want my super-exhausted baby to sleep on the floor in the airport. As it was after midnight already, I couldn't book a room on Expedia or other online booking website as they couldn't take May 2nd as the check-in date. Therefore I started calling every hotel around the airport. Finally a hotel had two rooms available and they cost us $169+taxes although the regular online booking price is no more than $128, thanks to AC for causing the last min booking.",5th May 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Deer Lake via Vancouver,May 2017,1,3,1,0,1,0,1,"['Honolulu', 'Vancouver']",2,7.0,5,1.4,-1.0,-0.0024074074074074124,"['deer', 'lake', 'via', 'family', 'wonderful', 'hawaii', 'trip', 'upsetting', 'ending', 'due', 'horrible', 'service', 'endured', 'multiple', 'delays', 'cancellations', 'due', 'technical', 'issues', 'planes', 'pay', 'three', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'pocket', 'accommodate', 'old', 'baby', 'elderly', 'parents', 'stranded', 'overnight', 'separate', 'cities', 'took', 'days', 'back', 'home', 'instead', 'scheduled', 'hours', 'returning', 'delayed', 'due', 'technical', 'issues', 'found', 'delay', 'arrived', 'airport', 'around', 'pm', 'previous', 'warning', 'departure', 'initially', 'postponed', 'pm', 'delayed', 'early', 'morning', 'ac', 'told', 'since', 'cancel', 'responsible', 'book', 'hotel', 'room', 'despite', 'fact', 'infant', 'seniors', 'travelling', 'understand', 'ac', 'expected', 'families', 'small', 'children', 'babies', 'deal', 'sleep', 'airport', 'floor', 'decided', 'book', 'hotel', 'room', 'since', 'hours', 'ahead', 'infant', 'baby', 'travelling', 'motel', 'room', 'airport', 'shuttle', 'cost', 'due', 'last', 'minute', 'booking', 'ac', 'postpone', 'departure', 'neither', 'husband', 'able', 'sleep', 'well', 'afraid', 'miss', 'beginning', 'horrible', 'experience', 'supposed', 'connecting', 'arriving', 'due', 'first', 'delay', 'ac', 'cancel', 'subsequent', 'rebook', 'rest', 'trip', 'instead', 'flying', 'deer', 'lake', 'night', 'arrived', 'stay', 'overnight', 'ac', 'give', 'rest', 'boarding', 'passes', 'book', 'hotel', 'agent', 'told', 'needed', 'hotel', 'ac', 'customer', 'service', 'ac', 'delayed', 'plane', 'land', 'airport', 'pm', 'may', 'time', 'plane', 'almost', 'people', 'line', 'ac', 'customer', 'service', 'kiosk', 'three', 'agents', 'working', 'line', 'hardly', 'moved', 'midnight', 'agent', 'came', 'line', 'telling', 'hotels', 'around', 'airport', 'sold', 'look', 'hotels', 'desk', 'closing', 'minutes', 'agents', 'leave', 'despite', 'still', 'many', 'unserved', 'told', 'call', 'ac', 'rebook', 'told', 'find', 'hotel', 'ac', 'reimburse', 'cad', 'per', 'room', 'seriously', 'want', 'ask', 'ac', 'find', 'hotel', 'room', 'cost', 'less', 'nowadays', 'learned', 'helped', 'anyone', 'desk', 'husband', 'started', 'call', 'ac', 'booking', 'started', 'looking', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'since', 'exhausted', 'want', 'baby', 'sleep', 'floor', 'airport', 'midnight', 'already', 'book', 'room', 'expedia', 'online', 'booking', 'website', 'take', 'may', 'date', 'therefore', 'started', 'calling', 'every', 'hotel', 'around', 'airport', 'finally', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'available', 'cost', 'although', 'regular', 'online', 'booking', 'price', 'thanks', 'ac', 'causing', 'last', 'min', 'booking']","['horrible', 'service']",neg

lucky to only lose one day of our vacation,R Roberts,VerifiedReview," We were flying Charlotte to London via Toronto with Air Canada. We realized that Toronto was limited by a closed runway and asked to be rerouted the night before but were assured that we would make our connecting flight. Despite our plane sitting outside of the gate in Charlotte we were delayed over two hours going to Toronto due to a lack of landing slots since Toronto was down to a single runway. Canadian flights have priority over US. Luckily, we were able to get four seats (not together) on the next morning's flight to London from Toronto but we had to spend a long, cold, uncomfortable night in the Toronto airport. Air Canada offered no accommodations for us due to this delay. The return flight was almost as bad.

showed complete indifference,Gregory Conti,VerifiedReview," I was supposed to fly Air Canada from London Heathrow to Columbus via Toronto. After arriving in Toronto, I learned that my connecting flight was cancelled. I was rebooked on a flight several hours later. This was then delayed, and I became worried that it would be cancelled. However, after repeated inquiries with the Air Canada gate agent, I was informed that it would be taking off that night, although hours late. Then at the last second this flight was cancelled, around 9 pm. No announcement was made of the cancellation until after it was supposed to have departed - the flight simply stopped being listed online or on the airport board. I entered a long customer service line, however, in the midst of waiting the agents went home from their shift. No clarity was provided about where we were supposed to go next. The customer service agents simply walked away. A long period of confusion in which it was simply impossible to find any Air Canada representatives. The amount of understaffing was appalling, and there appeared to be no urgency from anyone I spoke to about resolving the many issues that people were having. Finally, I wound up in a rebooking line, where I stood for over two hours before being helped. Despite repeated complaints from me and others to increase the level of staffing, this never happened: there were only two agents for dozens of customers. When I finally got to speak to someone, they made it clear that at the earliest I could fly to Columbus the following evening, because the earlier flights to Columbus were cancelled or fully-booked. The fact that I could not get out of Toronto until the following evening made my trip moot (it was only a two-day trip for a conference, one of which I would have completely missed). I therefore requested that I simply be booked a return ticket to London for the next morning and I gave up on my trip. After some haggling the agent reserved a place for me on a flight. However, although I was entitled by Air Canada policy to a hotel room for the night, none was provided for me. I spent the night on the floor of the Toronto airport. Despite pleading for some kind of compensation (I mentioned access to the airline lounge, so that I might change clothes / take a shower / have a minimum of comfort), I was given nothing but $20 of food vouchers. The next day my flight back to London was delayed almost two hours simply out of poor handling. In sum, Air Canada showed complete indifference to stranded travellers, made no effort to provide adequate staffing to deal with the problems that stranded travellers were facing; provided no lodging, were completely untransparent about the reasons for the delays and cancellations. To top it off, they are now being very difficult with regards to a refund. I was told that I had to go through Expedia, because that was where I made my booking. Now Expedia has sent me back to Air Canada. Air Canada claims that it may take 25 days to process my request. This should be the simplest matter in the world, there is no gray area: my trip was cancelled, I never made it to my destination, and I was left stranded at the airport without lodging in violation of their own policy. I just want my money back.

"less legroom, very limited IFE",C Davidson,VerifiedReview,"  Victoria-Toronto-Ottawa 15 March, returning 21 March. Reservation made through AC website and seat selection purchased at that time. In both directions, YYJ-YYZ legs served by A321s, YYZ-YOW legs by A320s. Seats and legroom comfortable although there was a 5 cm gap between the fuselage and window-seat armrests, reducing seat width unnecessarily. FAs made frequent runs to offer water. Three main glitches, all to be taken in stride as part of air travel nowadays: (i) Outbound from YYJ, the video safety presentation could not be played aloud through the cabin's PA system (though it was on the video screen), so FAs had to demonstrate the safety features themselves. (ii) The onward outbound YYZ-YOW leg was delayed nearly an hour, with all passengers remaining seated, while a possible technical fault in the cockpit controls was investigated. (iii) Accumulation of incoming flights at YOW meant that YOW baggage system was backed up and dispensing of baggage was delayed till an hour after aircraft had arrived. Oddly, on the five-hour return leg YYZ to YYJ, when I purchased a gin-and-tonic the miniature bottle was labelled ""Duty free"" and ""Export strength"" (47.3 percent alcohol). If Air Canada can use duty-free alcohol to serve on domestic flights, their price of CAD 6.50 per drink is pretty steep.

Business Class does not measure up,T Foran,VerifiedReview,"  Toronto to Munich with Air Canada. There is good news and bad news here. The food was better than any Air Canada Business Class meal I have had before. The staff were enthusiastic and attentive. The onboard entertainment selection was very weak, with a few new movies and even fewer classic movies. The music choice was appallingly short. I was not given noise cancelling headphones and was left with the awful headphones that AC gives out for free to economy class. The lie flat bed has very hard and I could not sleep.I expressly book business class so that I may get good sleep. The agent in Toronto did not mention to me that I needed to obtain my luggage in Munich and take it to my connecting flight. So, I had no luggage for the first two days of my trip. Business class is so costly that every individual detail is vital and can not be overlooked. So, despite the better meals, Air Canada Does not measure up when it comes to their Business Class product to the level of even the good European carriers.

flight seats had been oversold,K Murtle,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to Vancouver. We arrived at the airport with lots of time to spare prior to our flight. One of the check in ladies helped us get our bags sorted and accepted. We paid to check our bags in for Vancouver on that flight checking in a small suitcase and a larger one. She printed us boarding passes and bag tags and explained that our seat allocations would be made at the gate. We arrived at the gate with lots of time to spare and waited. The staff there announced that they thought there was insufficient space on the plane to take all of the passengers carry on luggage and started to request that passengers voluntarily check their carry on luggage in. They also started to circulate around the passengers and tried to ‘talk’ anyone with largish carry on bags or multiple luggage items to check them in. They then announced that the flight seats had been oversold and that they wanted ‘volunteers’ to take a later flight. Then we were told that they would call out names for final seat allocations. I heard a name that started with the same letter as ours and approached the counter to personally enquire if it was in fact for our seat allocation. The Air Canada staff were all looking distressed and under pressure at this stage. I was told that it wasn’t my name but the lady took our ‘boarding passes’ and said that our tickets were only standby tickets. I noticed that the copy which she kept, with no seat allocation printed on it actually had ‘sb’ in very small letters where the seat number would normally be printed which meant nothing to me up until that very moment. She said she would check and call out my name in due course with seat allocations. After another 10 or 15 minutes and a number of other customers being issued boarding passes, she called my name and started speaking. I explained I was an international traveller and had to get back to Vancouver on that flight. I told her I had bought and paid for my tickets weeks earlier and as far as I was concerned, I was contractually entitled to travel on that flight. We did get onto the flight, probably because I had been so insistent. When we arrived at Vancouver, after the 5 hour flight plus a lengthy wait at the carousel, our smaller case finally came onto the conveyor. I checked with the lost baggage staff, again having to wait for some time in a queue. They were good and advised that my other bag had been routed on a flight to Toronto and would arrive later that night. They would then deliver it to my Vancouver address the next morning. It arrived at about 1430 hours the next day and it looked as though it had been dragged through muddy water. It was filthy. And the luggage tag on it was tagged ‘standby’ as well.

disappointed in Air Canada,Josh Banman,VerifiedReview,"  Puerto Vallarta to Kelowna via Vancouver. Flight to Puerto Vallarta was good, staff awesome and service was prompt. Unfortunately on the way home I can't say the same. We checked in early and selected our seats to ensure a window and isle seat and to avoid the long lines at the airport waiting for check in. Once we arrived at the airport we waited 3rd in line for over an hour watching everyone who was checking in at the airport go through infront of us due to a computer issue. Then we were told that the flight was full and we had to sit in the middle despite checking in 24 hours before. Once in the plane the AC unit went down and we sat on the runway inside the boiling hot plan for an hour while crews scrambled to fix the issue. So we take off and I'm excited to get water after waiting in a hot plane for an hour only to wait 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight to even speak to a flight attendant. When I asked why things were so slow they scoffed at me and blamed the airline for cutting down from 7-6 flight attendants for this flight. Now I understand this can be stressful for them and create more work, but where I'm confused is how come on the way down with 6 flight attendants I received awesome service and water and coffee several times? I wish it could stop there but unfortunately it doesn't, we had to catch a connecting flight wich was overbooked, and we were asked if anyone would like to stay behind in Vancouver, only to find out it was so two Air Canada employees could fly home. Once our connecting flight to Kelowna landed at 12am our little plane of 30 had to sit on the runway for an hour while the other 2 international planes of over 150 passengers unloaded.

I took seat 12A in Premium Economy, which felt great compared to coach (which I have typically flown).

doubt I'll fly Air Canada again,M Lawson,VerifiedReview," I have travelled extensively over the years with many different airlines and, unfortunately, I have to say, I found on my recent flights Sydney to Vancouver return, the service on Air Canada is amongst the slackest I have experienced. On the way back from Vancouver, I had a head cold and needed regular drinks. I buzzed several times for tea / water etc but only once was my request answered. For the rest of the 16 hour journey, I buzzed but to no avail. Each time I needed a drink, or food, I had to get up from my seat, crawl over my fellow passengers, walk to the end of the aircraft to get my own refreshment. The worst part was, the entire crew was having a lovely time sitting down at the back, chatting away to each ignoring passenger requests. When I asked if they had noticed my bell call, they said they didn't hear it. However, when they looked, there were 3 others needing assistance listed on the screen. I wouldn't have heard the bell either if I was in the middle of a conversation. In addition to the lack of service, I feel that there could have been more food offered (it was minimal on such a long flight) and at no stage did the drinks trolley go around. Up to each passenger to request a drink. I guess it's a money saving ploy. The inflight entertainment was limited to a dozen movies that have been out for some time and didn't cater to a range of tastes. On 2 x 16 hour flights, this meant the choice was very limiting so I resorted to reading my book. Also, no wifi. Now that Air Canada has some competition from Sydney to Vancouver, it may be worth the crew lifting their game to remain competitive. On a positive note, the flight crew did a marvellous job getting us from A to B on both flights. Just a pity the cabin crew let the airline down.

cancelled due to weather,M Landic,VerifiedReview,"  Victoria to Toronto via Vancouver. I was travelling with my 5 children (ages 2 to 12) and their grandma when our flight back to Toronto was cancelled due to weather. I was on the phone approximately 2.5 hours (on hold) until 1:30am at which time I had to hang up to go to bed. The next day I received an e-mail that we had been rebooked for the following day, meaning we would need to spend another night in Victoria. I called and spoke to a very rude representative and asked what am I supposed to do now with my 5 kids and their grandma and she replied that you need to book yourself a hotel room and that was it. The statement was, since weather is not in our control we're not obligated to pay hotel, food, transfers.

offers high quality flights,D Cheng,VerifiedReview,"  I have never understood the bad rap that Air Canada gets. I have flown both main Canadian airlines (AC and WJ) lots and without really caring one way or the other, and have felt that Air Canada consistently offers high quality flights and flight service. On this recent flight I was in Premium Economy on a Boeing 787-8. Leg room and seat width in this cabin is substantially better than in coach, and you get the business class meal (china, glassware, and chilled silverware) with a printed menu and choice of main course. The meal itself is noticeably larger than in coach (if you are in coach, remember that you can ask for an extra meal and they are almost always able to give you one - I've done this on multiple occasions). Being an inter-continental flight, you also get complimentary alcoholic beverages in ALL classes. This flight (as well as AC850 from YYC to London) arrived early. The attendants were attentive and friendly, and airplane was clean, and the service was excellent.

would describe my experience as mediocre,R Peters,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Dallas Fort Worth on January 14, 2017, in Economy.

There was no apology from Air Canada. The plane was completely full. There was, however, sufficient room in the overhead lockers, as ground staff had warned people to check large pieces (free of charge at the gate, at check-in, my suitcase was 35 CAD). Seating is very tight on the Embraer 175, when the person in front of me reclined his seat, there were about 10 inches from my head to the top of his seat. Thus, the three-hour flight was pretty uncomfortable. Likewise, when I used the bathroom at the back of the plane, I found that I could not fully stand up (I am 6'1""). For service, the cabin crew came through once with soft drinks; everything else had to be purchased. At the end of the flight, I asked one of the cabin attendants where our luggage would be arriving: ""On the carousel,"" she said - not very helpful, as there are about ten of those at terminal E.

There were two other washrooms that were shared with premium economy class. Overall, I was not very impressed with the washrooms arrangements. The cabin crew were helpful but not the best. The overall inflight experience was a positive one. Despite the food being so-so, and I was not impressed with the washrooms, I had a restful and comfortable flight. My experience went downhill when I couldn't find my luggage at the airport. Later that day, Air Canada confirmed that my luggage was left at Brisbane Airport.

I tried to explain to her that with the freezing cold winter in Edmonton, I could not possibly buy anything warm enough with $50. However, she could not do anything else and Air Canada does not have a customer service phone line. My luggage arrived 2 days later at my in-laws house.

seat configuration is simply awful,T Eldem,VerifiedReview, Munich to Toronto with Air Canada. We were met by the AC Concierge and promptly processed through the check-in formalities. The flight was delayed by a full hour due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. On board the high density configuration in Economy (3x4x3) on the B777 is simply awful. I had the bulkhead aisle seat and my knee and elbow were bumped several times and my foot stepped on twice. I cannot imagine anyone getting any sleep in that seat during an overnight flight. The configuration makes the aisles so narrow that one has to walk sideways so as not to bump into other passengers. This is a sad reminder that AC puts profits way ahead of passenger comfort.

new Business Class certainly an improvement,Harry Aronowicz,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada from Munich to Toronto. Our group travelling together January 3 ranged in age of over 60 to 3 children aged 11 months, 2 and 4 years. All of the flight crew were not only professional but extremely pleasant and caring. Food presentation excellent, entertainment program good and seat comfort fine. Even though pod system the layout does allow for communication amongst passengers - the prior claustrophobic feeling has been eliminated. Pilot ""connected"" in a very nice way with our grandchildren and all of us too. New Business Class certainly an improvement. Check in process civilised. Only minus is Munich Airport which has long walks and different floor levels to conquer till aircraft position can be reached.

expected what we paid for,L Fletcher,VerifiedReview,"  Vancouver to Sydney. So disappointed. We paid extra money for more legroom and, whilst understanding the reality of cramped spaces on any airline, expected what we paid for. We have done this on several occasions with Virgin and found the seating and surrounding area to be more than satisfactory. Instead the area in front was constantly used by passengers to access toilets on the other side of the plane and for a toddler (parents seated three rows behind) to run backwards and forwards. The space to the right of us over the wing was used by passengers to stretch and chat the entire overnight flight. The stewards/ stewardesses were nowhere in sight and surfaced only at meal time. The passenger seated beside my husband was a very large man who required an extension belt, no problem and not judging him, but it made for a very uncomfortable flight. Being a large man, he occupied some of my husband's seat as well as his own. When it was obvious (before take-off) the flight was going to be difficult due to this factor, the stewardess responded that she could understand it would be uncomfortable but the flight was full and there was nothing she could do. We contacted Air Canada upon our return to request a refund of the additional money outlaid and were told that they offer a high standard of service and apologised that we disagreed - basically 'bad-luck'!

what a terrible shame,M Norton,VerifiedReview,"  What has happened to our beautiful Airline? We always flew Air Canada for the service and the people but now I fly further to avoid Air Canada. On Dec 31 2016, AC873, FRA-YYZ, either the FA who worked the rear business class section was getting ready for retirement or she was having a really bad day because her unfriendly, take it or leave it, monosyllabic attitude was quite pronounced. The new business class seat on the 777-300 is actually not so bad. The screen's a bit close but it's big and the seat depth is a bit short (I could never get the foot rest up to a comfortable height) but there's lots of space and charging stations and places for things. Very mediocre wine selection, I think one choice of either old or new world in red or white and as I said very mediocre. I hear they have espresso's and cappuccino's but they were not offered. I ordered the vegetarian meal which came out vegan and really it's mind boggling what the kitchen at AC thinks vegetarians eat. Years ago I had an amazing veg meal on a flight from Toronto to Calgary, roasted veg with baked tofu, really well done but this was some tasteless roasted eggplant on Polenta with a tablespoon of tomato sauce and that's pretty much what AC serve these days. All of this would have been overlooked if the FA had shown any kind of welcome or pleasant attitude. It was bare minimum, no more and definitely no service with a smile. AC 610, YYZ-YHZ started out well and I slept through most of it until the last 15 minutes of landing approach, when a little boy two rows behind us in business class, started to piercingly scream for his mother and was unconsolable screaming ""Momee"" until we landed. I thought maybe mommy was meeting the plane but it turned out that ""Momee!"" was the FA in-charge. To her credit, she remained the FA in-charge and didn't get up but probably not a good idea to fly with the family. I was a loyal AC flyer for decades but now Lufthansa and United I like better and I fly them 90% of the time. The timing on this route was deciding factor in flying with AC this time but that will not happen again. LH FA's are always welcoming and friendly and cannot do enough to make you comfortable up front. Other airlines amenity kits are becoming collectables but not so the hideous herringbone, sparse offering on AC. LH, Eva and Thai's Rimova amenity kits are a reason to fly them and not available anywhere else. I think AC have forgotten that many of us love to fly and it's about a happy experience.

use phone but no headphones,Chris Fox,VerifiedReview,"  Air Canada - I thought they were a full service airline. Paid over AUD$500 for two of us to fly from Quebec a short hop to Toronto. This doesn't include checked baggage however (an extra $60) nor assigning a seat (that's an extra online fee as well). On arrival at the airport we realised the flight was full and when checking in on the kiosks we had been assigned separate seats on the aircraft despite being on the same booking. Fortunately a passenger next to me agreed to swap. The checkin agent was helpful only in explaining the reasons why we had been seated separately (a full aircraft, people on standby - not sure how any of this was relevant to not seat 2 people on the same booking next to each other). Now what Air Canada would likely say is that if we wanted seats we should have paid the online fee and seat assigned ourselves. It's a pity they have this type of model when they really are the only airline flying between many of these places in Canada. On a positive note, we did arrive and depart pretty close to schedule considering a big snowstorm had just been through the area. However I had to laugh when we arrived in a Toronto and the flight attendant made a PA asking all on board if we could let those with tight connections off the aircraft first, this was while we were waiting 10 minutes short of the bay for a marshaller to come and guide the aircraft onto the bay. I'd avoid Air Canada again except in a case such as this when they were the only nonstop option. On another note as well Air Canada have a policy that no headphones can be used on landing. But, portable electronic devices are permitted. So, you can use the phone but no headphones. When I enquired as to the reason behind this, Air Canada advised that this was for two reasons. Firstly, so they can ensure that you don't miss any PA announcements. And secondly, they can cause a hazard if you trip over the, during an evacuation. I have travelled a lot on many different airlines and this is the first I have heard of such an absurd policy.",31st December 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YQB to YYZ,December 2016,3,3,0,0,2,0,3,[],0,11.0,4,2.75,0.0,0.10317182817182818,"['thought', 'full', 'service', 'airline', 'paid', 'aud', 'fly', 'quebec', 'short', 'hop', 'include', 'checked', 'baggage', 'extra', 'assigning', 'seat', 'extra', 'online', 'fee', 'well', 'arrival', 'airport', 'realised', 'full', 'checking', 'kiosks', 'assigned', 'separate', 'seats', 'aircraft', 'despite', 'booking', 'fortunately', 'passenger', 'agreed', 'swap', 'checkin', 'agent', 'helpful', 'explaining', 'reasons', 'seated', 'separately', 'full', 'aircraft', 'people', 'standby', 'sure', 'relevant', 'seat', 'people', 'booking', 'likely', 'wanted', 'seats', 'paid', 'online', 'fee', 'seat', 'assigned', 'pity', 'type', 'model', 'really', 'airline', 'flying', 'many', 'places', 'positive', 'note', 'arrive', 'depart', 'pretty', 'close', 'schedule', 'considering', 'big', 'snowstorm', 'area', 'laugh', 'arrived', 'attendant', 'pa', 'asking', 'board', 'let', 'tight', 'connections', 'aircraft', 'first', 'waiting', 'minutes', 'short', 'bay', 'marshaller', 'come', 'guide', 'aircraft', 'onto', 'bay', 'avoid', 'except', 'case', 'nonstop', 'option', 'another', 'note', 'well', 'policy', 'headphones', 'used', 'landing', 'portable', 'electronic', 'devices', 'permitted', 'use', 'phone', 'headphones', 'enquired', 'reason', 'behind', 'advised', 'reasons', 'firstly', 'ensure', 'miss', 'pa', 'announcements', 'secondly', 'cause', 'hazard', 'trip', 'evacuation', 'travelled', 'lot', 'many', 'different', 'airlines', 'first', 'heard', 'absurd', 'policy']","['use', 'phone', 'headphones']",pos

it lacked in service,Sid Grover,VerifiedReview,"  Delhi to Toronto. Although Air Canada had a newer plane, the Boeing 787, it lacked in service. Executive pod seats are very comfortable. Fully flat bad recline. Lots of place to store things like phone, wallet. Food tasted fresh and had decent flavours. One of the washrooms wasn't working - the one in the front right by the cockpit. This is not a big deal for a 7 hr flight but a 15 hrs flight it is. As a result we had access to two washrooms behind the cabin - still not bad. Air Canada did a horrible job in terms of controlling who can access which washroom. Folks from premium economy and economy were using the business washrooms. I mean I paid extra for a reason. Every time I had to visit the washroom - there was a line up.  My wife was sleeping and didn't hear the announcement that the front washroom is not working - when she went to the front, one of the staff members rudely said, ""we told you it's not working"" My wife apologized and came back. Service - Before take off the staff brought drinks like champagne and orange juice, and my wife asked for a ginger ale. Staff initially brought sprite by mistake and then forgot about it. When my wife asked for ginger ale again she was told we cannot serve on ground. Initially we were not given the menu. When I complained they brought it. And then they took away my wife's food menu by mistake. Every time she asked for a menu - staff did a horrible job explaining what's available instead of giving a menu. In the morning she asked for omelette and was still given crepes. Everyone else was given 3 choices for breakfast. But some like myself were given 2. This is how inconsistent the service was.

I understand many variables are out of their control, but the lack of care I have seen and heard about them showing to their customers is disappointing. Tonight is one of those occasions when my flight from Halifax to Montreal for 6.10 was delayed to 6.50. That's no problem, and they told us multiple times during this 40 minute delay that our flight was in the air and on the way. 10 minutes before we are supposed to take off, they announce that the plane still hasn't left because of the poor visibility in Montreal and that it would be delayed for much longer. I understand that the plane can't take off, but everyone has been left upset because they lied to people saying the flight was on the way when it would appear they had no idea where it actually was. Since this incident the flight has been delayed twice more without notice from the staff, the time at the gate has simply changed to show a half hour later departure.

left us stranded at the airport,Richard Ferris,VerifiedReview,"  Recently, my wife and I were flying from Rochester to Cairo by way of Toronto and London Heathrow. My wife and I were originally told at the gate in Toronto that the flight from Toronto to London was delayed 15 minutes, then it became 30 minutes. Then we were told that a new plane had to be brought in because of a mechanical issue and it would be about a 1.5 hour delay. We explained our concern to the agent at the gate, because we only had a 2 hour layover in Heathrow and were worried about missing our connecting flight to Cairo. She said that the plane would ""make up time in the air"". Ultimately, we actually left more than 2 hours later than scheduled because the new plane was also late. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Cairo. There are several exacerbating factors than just a delay. When we got on the plane, I told the flight attendant that we were going to be rushed to get to our connecting flight and asked if we could be let out first. Her response was ""We'll see"". When we landed, we were not given any accommodation whatsoever. We didn't land until approximately 10:15 p.m. The flight crew said that ""if"" we missed our connecting flight (scheduled to leave at 10:30), we should go upstairs to the ticket office to get re-booked. Apparently, they didn't know, despite servicing that airport, that Heathrow pretty much shuts down at 10pm and so the ticket offices were already deserted by the time we got there and the terminal gates shut down. This left us stranded at the airport, with no instructions or assistance, or any idea what we were supposed to do. We happened to ask a worker at the airport and he said we should check to see if our bags were there. Come to find out, our bags had been taken off the plane and set aside (not on the carousel). No one with Air Canada let us know our bags would be dropped off at Heathrow, rather than go straight to Cairo as originally planned. Obviously, whomever removed the bags knew we wouldn't be able to get on the next flight, even though no one else seemed to. If it hadn't been for the airport employee, we wouldn't have even known our bags were and they would have been inadvertently abandoned. We had to stay at the airport until the ticket office re-opened at 6:30 a.m. Once we got there, the Air Canada employee said a ticket agent would have been waiting outside the plane for us, to provide a hotel room. I'm not sure how we were supposed to know this when we were told conflicting information by the flight crew and the only people we saw waiting at the gate were there to help some disabled travelers in need of assistance. No one had a sign with our name or anything which would allow us to know that steps had been taken to provide us with a place to sleep. As a result of this delay, we lost a full day of a paid tour in Egypt and incurred expenses at the airport for food and beverages, since the next flight wasn't until 2pm that following day. In our complaint to Air Canada, they offered a discount for a future booking and didn't even address reimbursement for our out-of-pocket loss. I've made numerous international flights and this is the first time I've had any substantive issues with an airline.

put the needs of customers second,C Pang,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to Toronto. The plane was delayed by around half an hour due to the late arrival of the aircraft. Halfway through the flight, about 40 minutes or so before we were scheduled to land at Billy Bishop Airport in downtown Toronto, the crew announced that the plane needed to be diverted to Pearson Airport, around 1hr away from downtown. Of course everyone was upset, but the reason given for the diversion was that (due to the delayed departure), the downtown airport was closed due to the night curfew. It was around 21.45hrs at the time, so I assumed the curfew was at 22.00hrs. Once we landed at Pearson, a manager came onboard and contradicted what was stated earlier. The plane was diverted because the crew were based at and needed to return to Pearson Airport. There were around 40 passengers aboard, and the time and inconvenience of these passengers were less important than the time of their crew. While I empathise with the plight of the hardworking crew, it says a lot about an airline that would put the needs of its customers second. And the airport curfew at Billy Bishop that the passengers were informed about and initially used as the justification for the diversion? It's 23.00hrs, meaning we had plenty of time to land. So the airline lied.",24th December 2016,Business,Economy Class,YUL to YTZ,December 2016,2,2,2,0,3,0,3,[],0,12.0,5,2.4,0.0,-0.06439393939393938,"['montreal', 'plane', 'delayed', 'around', 'half', 'hour', 'due', 'late', 'arrival', 'aircraft', 'halfway', 'minutes', 'scheduled', 'land', 'billy', 'bishop', 'airport', 'downtown', 'crew', 'announced', 'plane', 'needed', 'diverted', 'pearson', 'airport', 'around', 'away', 'downtown', 'course', 'everyone', 'upset', 'reason', 'given', 'diversion', 'due', 'delayed', 'departure', 'downtown', 'airport', 'closed', 'due', 'night', 'curfew', 'around', 'time', 'assumed', 'curfew', 'landed', 'pearson', 'manager', 'came', 'onboard', 'contradicted', 'stated', 'earlier', 'plane', 'diverted', 'crew', 'based', 'needed', 'return', 'pearson', 'airport', 'around', 'passengers', 'aboard', 'time', 'inconvenience', 'passengers', 'less', 'important', 'time', 'crew', 'empathise', 'plight', 'hardworking', 'crew', 'says', 'lot', 'airline', 'put', 'needs', 'customers', 'second', 'airport', 'curfew', 'billy', 'bishop', 'passengers', 'informed', 'initially', 'used', 'justification', 'diversion', 'meaning', 'plenty', 'time', 'land', 'airline', 'lied']","['put', 'needs', 'customers', 'second']",neg

no customer service for lost items,Jamie Marwick,VerifiedReview,"  Don't use Air Canada if there's the remote possibility you might leave something of value on the plane. Their chat service and baggage centre number's is unresponsive (no one answers the phone or chat sessions) with only five days to recover the item. While travelling from December 18, 2016 from Ottawa to Moncton the second flight, AC7502, was delayed on the Montreal tarmac for an hour and a half. As I had a two hour layover between the arrival of the flight in Moncton and the departure of my connecting bus this would only leave a half hour but with the baggage about twenty minutes at best. My issue isn't with the delayed flight but with the complete and total lack of customer support. While rushing to get off the plane to ensure I got to the bus stop outside the airport in time I had accidentally left my Kobo eBook reader in the pouch on the seat in front of me. I only realized it was missing once I was on the bus. I tried repeatedly calling the Air Canada toll free baggage centre number 1-888-689-2247 over the next few days and after an hour of waiting each time never got a representative. The recorded message prior to the hold music advised for missing items on a plane to ""chat"" with a chat representative. I tried that as well and found that not only was the chat window freezing and unresponsive (if you tried typing there was a significant delay before letters would show in the chat window) but I never could get ahold of a chat representative after another hour of waiting. I wasn't sure if the chat session was working and I tried repeatedly over the next few days without success. I had found, though, that the Air Canada policy was to hold lost and found items for five days. It's now the fifth day and after repeated attempts I still can't get a response by phone or chat. I also sent a form filled message to their general customer support feedback but only received a confirmation of receipt and not actual feedback on the lost item. My issue isn't with the delayed flight or poor customer service. My issue is that there's surprisingly no customer service for lost items. I advise anyone who doesn't want to be in the same position and would at least a chance at recovering a forgotten item left on a plane not to use Air Canada.",22nd December 2016,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YOW to YQM via YUL,December 2016,3,3,0,0,1,0,3,[],0,10.0,4,2.5,0.0,0.025505050505050503,"['use', 'remote', 'possibility', 'might', 'leave', 'something', 'value', 'plane', 'chat', 'service', 'baggage', 'centre', 'number', 'unresponsive', 'answers', 'phone', 'chat', 'sessions', 'five', 'days', 'recover', 'item', 'travelling', 'december', 'second', 'delayed', 'montreal', 'tarmac', 'hour', 'half', 'hour', 'layover', 'arrival', 'departure', 'connecting', 'bus', 'leave', 'half', 'hour', 'baggage', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'best', 'issue', 'delayed', 'complete', 'total', 'lack', 'customer', 'support', 'rushing', 'plane', 'ensure', 'bus', 'stop', 'outside', 'airport', 'time', 'accidentally', 'left', 'kobo', 'ebook', 'reader', 'pouch', 'seat', 'front', 'realized', 'missing', 'bus', 'tried', 'repeatedly', 'calling', 'toll', 'free', 'baggage', 'centre', 'number', 'days', 'hour', 'waiting', 'time', 'never', 'representative', 'recorded', 'message', 'prior', 'hold', 'music', 'advised', 'missing', 'items', 'plane', 'chat', 'chat', 'representative', 'tried', 'well', 'found', 'chat', 'window', 'freezing', 'unresponsive', 'tried', 'typing', 'significant', 'delay', 'letters', 'show', 'chat', 'window', 'never', 'ahold', 'chat', 'representative', 'another', 'hour', 'waiting', 'sure', 'chat', 'session', 'working', 'tried', 'repeatedly', 'days', 'success', 'found', 'though', 'policy', 'hold', 'lost', 'found', 'items', 'five', 'days', 'fifth', 'day', 'repeated', 'attempts', 'still', 'ca', 'response', 'phone', 'chat', 'sent', 'form', 'filled', 'message', 'general', 'customer', 'support', 'feedback', 'received', 'confirmation', 'receipt', 'actual', 'feedback', 'lost', 'item', 'issue', 'delayed', 'poor', 'customer', 'service', 'issue', 'surprisingly', 'customer', 'service', 'lost', 'items', 'advise', 'anyone', 'want', 'position', 'least', 'chance', 'recovering', 'forgotten', 'item', 'left', 'plane', 'use']","['customer', 'service', 'lost', 'items']",pos
it was another good flight,Claudio Rallo,VerifiedReview,"  Amsterdam to Ottawa via London. Unlike the previous two times when I transferred at Toronto Pearson, I now made a stopover at London Heathrow so it was an interline flight with British Airways. I tend to choose for Air Canada on the route between Amsterdam and Ottawa because it is generally cheaper and has a better schedule than the competition. It was a really smooth 7-hour long plane trip, and the airplane used on the London to Ottawa route is the usual Boeing 767-300ER, an old but always reliable workhorse in the medium-sized, long-range plane repertoire. The cabin crew members were nice and worked very efficiently. I use Air Canada often and while the drinks and snacks are good, I have come to refusing the main meal because in economy class they always serve the same two things and they're simply uneatable. I really do believe that Air Canada could come up with better standard economy class meals. The legroom was good enough and there was a good choice of films and shows on the inflight entertainment system.

the airline of my choice,Bobby Giannakopoulos,VerifiedReview,"  Montreal to New York-LaGuardia. I travel often with Air Canada because it's the airline of my choice and there's always good route options out of Montreal which is one of their main hubs.  I chose LaGuardia airport because there's more flights than Newark airport. The flights were operated by Sky Regional their airline partner on short haul legs. I was suppose to take a morning flight however I ended up taking an afternoon flight because I had a Business Class booking on stand by and the morning flights were oversold. My flights were full, gates agents were asking for volunteers to check in some oversize carry on bags. I had a seat on the economy cabin because there were upgrades last minute. The return flight was Business class. All the flights were good. The service was pretzels with a drink in economy class and a light snack with a drink in Business class. The flight attendant was very nice on the inbound flight, taking good care of me and my family during the flight. The flight attendant was fine on the return leg but she was a bit exhausted. Inflight  entertainment was very good for a short flight. There was a choice of movies and tv shows on the screens on each seat.

the seats were the most uncomfortable I have flown,A Estefan,Not Verified,"For a while now, I have believed that Air Canada have the edge over British Airways on this route. Whereas BA seem to have slipped into complacency and slimming down their service, Air Canada have upped their game and provided superior service and comfort. However, this month I had the displeasure of flying on their new 787 in economy class. Although the service was, as usual, very good, the seats were the most uncomfortable I have flown in for a long time. The new 787 economy seat is incredibly narrow, offering little sideways movement and virtually no room for the arms. When I managed to rest my left arm on the seat, I was setting off the call bell because the entertainment controls are located exactly where you would rest your arm, very poor design indeed. I also noticed that the quality of inflight catering has dropped, too.

poor customer service,Peter Clements,VerifiedReview,"  Halifax to London Heathrow via Toronto. We booked a flight to London for my wife. We made sure it was the direct flight as well to make it easier for her. Also booked it early to make sure we got what we wanted. Near the departure date, we got an e mail to say that her itinerary was changed to via Toronto. I phoned the airline and they told me the flight had been taken off and said book another day or accept what you have. It was a take it or leave it situation. Of course we had to take it. So she endured a long and difficult day as she is less able and the connection was rushed and it was tough. Imagine her annoyance when she finally got to Heathrow to find the direct flight we previously booked arriving at much the same time! They also managed to lose her baggage! Contact with Air Canada customer service was difficult. No response to the web mail submission. Telephone calls just produced advice to resubmit the complaint - which I did and still no response. In the end I had to badger them on social media to get any contact. It took a week to get anything from them. Their response was that some time after taking our flight off, it was put back again and people who had that flight cancelled were not given the opportunity to return to that flight. So those who were wise enough to book early lost out, while those who booked late got what we were denied. They said that as a goodwill gesture they would offer us 15% discount on our next flight. Useless as we don't intend flying again this year. Hardly good will as it was their poor customer service that caused all this.

2 days of nightmare,P Hedron,VerifiedReview,"  Washington to Montreal. 2 days of nightmare on what should have been a 1.5 hour flight. My flight from IAD to YUL was cancelled, not one person from Air Canada could advise why - huge line was formed and approximately 2 hours later I was offered a flight the following day ""first thing in the morning"" (for Air Canada, 11 am is ""first thing in the morning""). After much effort I was able to convince them to put me on a flight to Montreal connecting through Toronto (yes, my direct flight had to be changed to a flight connecting through Toronto so I could leave on an actual ""first in the morning"" flight. So when I was finally seeing all this nightmare stop to expand itself, it was actually time for Air Canada's yet other fiasco: they couldn't reprint my ticket because it was bought by my company (business trip) and they didn't know how to do it. It was past 8 pm, I thought I would be home in Montreal at 7 pm, and I was still in Washington DC getting my ticket reprinted. After they were finally able to, I was given a 15 dollars voucher for dinner that I had to use in a hotel's restaurant where the cheapest meal was 30 (or 40 if you added taxes and tip). In addition to that, I was refused a cab service to and from that hotel, and was told to use the free shuttle which started running 4:40 am (and my boarding time was 5:30 am). I arrived Toronto at 8 am and there was a flight to Montreal with room for more people but I couldn't get in because my luggage was on a different schedule, so I had to wait until 10 am to fly to Montreal.

Air Canada rebooked me on the same flight, but on the following day, meaning I would lose 1 full day from my holiday time. AC staff unhelpful. After much discussion and haggling, I was able to put myself on a later flight from YYJ to YVR, and then from YVR to LHR with a British Airways flight. The lone cabin crew on YYJ to YVR flight AC 8078 appeared so disinterested in passengers - couldn't be bother to even say hello as we boarded and exited the plane. AC 8078 was on a noisy, extremely uncomfortable Bombardier Dash 8-300 propeller plane. Even a 30 minute flight felt like an eternity. Return trip from LHR to YVR and onto YYJ. LHR to YVR on AC high density B777-300ER. Although I had a spare seat next to me, it was impossible to relax, given how cramped the seating was. Aisles were extremely narrow - flight attendants continuously bumped into me. Sleep or rest was impossible. YVR - YYJ sector was again on the Bombardier Dash 8-300 propeller plane.

service is impeccable,Chris Summers,VerifiedReview,"  First flight in Business Class with Air Canada from London Heathrow to Montreal. First noted was the ease at T2 and the great service in the Maple Lounge. After take off we were served drinks and snacks that were topped up without waiting for the trolley to come around. Amazing service so far against BA who I normally fly with and Gold member. What is good is the layout of seats, you don't sit facing a random person plus you don't have to climb over anyone to go to the toilet if in a window seat. The tables are great and the cabin crew come and bring a table cloth before they bring the food, another plus better than BA. Appetiser was first class, salmon and salad. Main was a rack of lamb followed by cheese and a selection of ice cream followed by a port. The service is impeccable compared to BA and I think BA is overrated just because of the brand. The plus point is Air Canada is 50% cheaper than BA. So far 3 hours into the flight and cannot fault it.

reached the point where enough is enough,P Knowles,VerifiedReview," Toronto to Sudbury with Air Canada. For a while I was purposefully flying Air Canada over other carriers as I enjoyed their new inflight entertainment options, but I've reached the point where enough is enough. I could have excused the fact that on about a third of the flights I've taken the sound or screen is broken, as technology fails. I could have excused that they keep adding new fees such as a fee to choose your seat in advance (not just for legroom anymore, for any seat). But this time I feel that I've run into an inexcusably unethical practice that has significantly disrupted my vacation plans. I've been on a multiple-destination vacation, which will take me on 6 flights. Air Canada's pricing structure made it costly to mix and match airlines, so all six flights were with Air Canada. I had decided to cancel the third flight, and drive the distance instead, so that I could see more family members. I didn't care if they charged me for the flight, I just wanted to notify them of the change of plans. When I called Air Canada, they told me that if I did this, they would charge me nearly $400, a $200 cancellation fee as well as the increased cost of the fourth flight, as it would need to be ""re-booked"". Then they told me that if I didn't pay this amount and didn't show up for the third flight, they would cancel the fourth flight. So even though I was willing to pay the same for less service, they wanted to charge me substantially more. They didn't offer any justification, I'm assuming that it's just designed to take advantage of people who are in a tough spot and have to change their plans, regardless of whether it increases the airline's cost. Pure greed. Even if it leads to additional administration, I couldn't see this amount being reasonable. Then, to top it off, I had asked if I could pay more to switch my last two flights to a later time. Online the price was $761 if I was booking a new flight. However, I was told that to make this change they would charge me almost an extra $1000.

needs to improve in a couple of areas,W Johnson,VerifiedReview,"  My husband and I travelled from Vancouver to Sydney with Air Canada in September 2016. We had a reasonably comfortable flight but Air Canada needs to improve in a couple of areas. Firstly: all the controls for entertainment, lights etc are in the armrest which is very inconvenient as it is too easy to accidentally turn off or on something unintentionally. I understand this can only be improved when designing new aeroplanes. Secondly: the choice of movies, tv etc on the entertainment system is very limited. On a 16 hour flight people need more than a few old re-runs and a couple of newer movies perhaps not to taste. Thirdly: neither on this flight nor our previous premium economy flight from Sydney to Vancouver were we given enough time to eat our food. Meals appear to be served so close to landing there is a rush to collect rubbish before people have time to eat. Staff commenced collecting plates before I even had time to take the lid off my meal.

AC was like a budget airline,G Anderson,VerifiedReview,"  It was my first time with Air Canada flying from London to Montreal. I have to say that the aircraft was good indeed. However my strong impression was that AC was like a budget airline. Inflight entertainment was limited and didn't work for my wife. We needed to ask to re-set it several times. Seats are not comfortable because armrests have built-in remote for inflight entertainment system and lights and you switch it off/on every time when you place your elbow on it accidentally. Serving food: items constantly were dropped down, flight attendants were picking them up from the floor and put on your table. Indeed it was better than United based on my many-year experience but still very close to it. My personal impression - Ryanair is treating their passengers a little bit better inflight - more genuine and attentive.

representative rude and discourteous,Jeffrey Brock,VerifiedReview,"  Nashville to London Gatwick via Toronto. Air Canada is the worst we've flown. Sept 7, 2016, a 1.5 hour take off delay from Nashville due to our plane's having no air conditioning, and with the air blowers at only 10% of capacity. Problem was not fixed and the cabin temp was nearly unbearable for the 2-hour packed flight to Toronto. The delay cost us a missed connection to London Gatwick because the airline schedules only 1-1/2 hours to connect from the Nashville arrival to their once-a-day London Gatwick departure. To make matters worse, in the process of deplaning from the Nashville flight there were no airline personnel directing US citizens to the shortcut past Canadian customs, which forced many US citizens on our flight, including us, to spend an hour waiting to go through customs, then another hour reclaiming our baggage, checking it back in, and going back through security, none of which US citizens at Toronto are required to do. The airline had booked us on the next Gatwick flight, 24 hours later, but we were able to get a flight that night to London Heathrow, which was delayed by 2 hours due to technical problems. We finally left at midnight. Through this ordeal every single Air Canada representative was rude and discourteous.  The airline would do nothing for us except give us $10 food certificates which bought us 2 bottles of water. We had not eaten anything by this time for 7 hours and did not get anything to eat until 2 hours into the London Heathrow flight. Because our rental car had been paid for at Gatwick with return of the car to be made there we were forced, upon arrival at Heathrow, to take a commuter bus at our cost, from Heathrow to Gatwick.  The return flight from Gatwick to Toronto was delayed by over 4 hours due to the failure of a  ticket agent at Gatwick to give a fellow passenger more than one claim tag for the two bags she had checked in. This failure caused an extra bag to show up in the system. Staff  were in an out of the cabin for the 4 hours trying to determine the bag's owner. As a last resort, the airline ordered all the passengers out of the plane and down to the tarmac to personally identify their own bags! The delay caused everyone on the plane to miss their connections in Toronto. The next available flight to Nashville was 24 hours later. The airline put us in an hotel 20 minutes from the airport and included 3 meal vouchers which could only be used at the hotel. Trouble is, the hotel didn't even have a restaurant.

no apology could satisfy me,S Mason,Not Verified,"Toronto to London Heathrow via Montreal. Normally am pleased with smooth travel experience with Air Canada. On Aug 25, however, I checked my suitcase in and boarded the aircraft, flew in to Montreal. Had a 2.5 hour wait time until the next flight. That flight boarded ok and we landed the next morning at Heathrow, and the 'adventure' began. My suitcase did not arrive. I very nearly missed my train at the mainline station I had to travel to because I had to report the missing bag to the agent, who took my details, provided me with an information sheet and file tracking number, and told me my bag was on the next flight. Couldn't seem to tell me why. After a few follow up calls without meaningful responses from the people at the number I was given to call, as well as from the courier, I also learned that the baggage department and the courier do not communicate to each other. That needs to change! Courier delivered my suitcase directly to me 3 days after my arrival. I got a bit of a runaround obtaining information on how best to proceed with submitting my receipts for reimbursement because the form wanted me to send to an address in the UK, but I reside in Canada. I was given instructions eventually and followed that with a letter plus documentation sent off to the baggage department in Dorval, Quebec. It is unacceptable to me that the airline (or whoever it was) should arbitrarily decide who's bag arrives with them and who's does not, especially when you are flying on their largest aircraft, and particularly failing to communicate this information to the passenger. I am not impressed, I am waiting for my reimbursement, and the days of me doing business with Air Canada are now seriously numbered.

The Air Canada employees at YKA are very helpful when it comes to dropping off your bag, and sending the luggage through to our final destination. Once we arrived at YVR (in the evening), we went through security and customs, and then had a nice dinner in the international side of YVR. Our flight from YVR to SYD was scheduled to leave at 11:40, and we left pretty much right on time. We were seated in ""Premium Economy"", and I was very satisfied with the seat comfort and our space. There are only 3 rows of seats for premium economy, which made the long flight comfortable, and less claustrophobic. The service was great, the food wasn't too bad, the entertainment was very good, and the cabin crew checked on us quite frequently throughout our flight.

not sympathetic or helpful,John Smith,Not Verified,"My wife and I recently took a trip to Montreal, Canada from Salt Lake City - USA, and we flew with Air Canada. Pretty much everything that could possibly go wrong with a travel experience happened. We were stuck on the aircraft for an hour after it had landed, and were certain to miss our connecting flight. Air Canada’s poor communication caused my wife and me to run across 8 terminals at LAX airport carrying our carry-ons and backpacks, to try to reach the connecting flight before it departed. The flight didn’t end up leaving for 2 more hours. During the 5-6 hour flight we were not once offered snacks. When we landed in Montreal our luggage was missing, and we were informed that it was still in LAX. We ended up having to come back to the airport later that night, wasting our vacation time and wasting money on gas and parking. The return flights home were even more of a nightmare. At our connecting flight in Toronto, we were denied access to the plane because Air Canada had overbooked. We had bought our tickets 2 months in advance, but that made no difference to them. The Air Canada representative was not sympathetic or helpful at all. We were put in a hotel for the night, as the next flight to Salt Lake wasn’t until the next morning, and we now had yet another 4 hour layover in Chicago on top of that. The 'compensation' isn't even close to cover our expenses, loss, and stress. When we finally landed in SLC, Air Canada had failed yet again to get our luggage to our destination. There was not even one Air Canada representative anywhere in the entire airport to help us or give us any amount of information. I had to call and wait a half hour on the phone before I got in touch with an Air Canada rep, who then informed me our luggage was still in Chicago. We ended up having to get it delivered to our home the next day.

ground staff at AMS were useless,Stewart Gordon,VerifiedReview,"  We flew Air Canada from Amsterdam AMS to Toronto YYZ having used British Airways to fly into Amsterdam. Initially we were concerned about the 1 hour 50 minutes connection time but this was not a problem as the Air Canada flight was delayed by 2 hours and 50 minutes. Plenty of time for our baggage to make it from the incoming flight. Ground staff at AMS were useless, there were 5 of them behind the counter at the gate but only one appeared to be interested in serving passengers. Once on board, the aircraft itself was old and in serious need of TLC. The seat in front of me was split and the inner foam was bulging out. The in-flight entertainment was delivered on poor quality screens with an even poorer selection of out dated movies. The staff were pleasant enough and appeared to care about passenger needs. Upon arrival at Toronto, only 3 of our bags had made the trip with no explanation as to why one of them was still at AMS. We completed the form and were told that the bag would come on the next available flight on the following day. It didn't come, in fact it was finally reunited with us 9 days later and this was only after I had re-attended YYZ twice after being told that it was there when it wasn't.

All of my flights were on time, efficient, and enjoyable. I enjoyed Air Canada's Preferred Seating/Premium Economy benefits on the A319 (the way down) and the A320 (on the way up). The first people to be served, the last people to get on the plane, extra legroom, more comfortable seats, and extra space between your neighbours made my flights to and from San Francisco really enjoyable. I will recommend the extra small fee to sit in preferred seating/premium economy benefits, on any Air Canada flights. The service between Kamloops and Vancouver is always efficient and on time.

appalling quality food,V Lewis,VerifiedReview,"  Flew Air Canada from Toronto to London Heathrow. Appalling quality food, and profit over passenger wellbeing. Took off an hour late as inbound flight late landing, nothing they could do about that, but surely they could have given out water? Food on both outbound was of such a low quality, cheap ingredients and generally poor quality meal when compared to many other large carriers. Children meals no better, deep fried 'smiley faces' and solid tomato pasta. This was a night flight, yet the full brightness cabin lights were still on at 11pm local Toronto time simply so they could finish duty free sales. This just smells of greed for profit over passenger wellbeing. Nobody could sleep and young children and babies were distressed due to this.

"supposed to leave Thursday, took-off Saturday",Heather Maimone,VerifiedReview," Cleveland to Sao Paulo via Toronto with Air Canada. We faced countless problems from the moment we started our journey to Brazil. We were scheduled to take off from Cleveland to Toronto on June 23 at 5:50pm. To then take Toronto to Sao Paulo on flight AC 0090 at 10:40pm. When I scheduled the flights, we gave ourselves plenty of time in between to go through customs and ensure that we made our flight to Brazil, as I had work meetings and an interstate flight to Rio de Janeiro on Saturday morning. The first problem we faced was our flight from Cleveland to Toronto was late arriving. There were problems with the flight or weather issues - no one really knew what was going on. We did not take off until 10pm - which didn't put us in Toronto until 11:15pm. This made us and at least 50 other people miss their international connections. Air Canada was able to put us in a hotel for that night and we were to come back the following evening for a 8pm flight to Sao Paulo, putting us in Sao Paulo now on Saturday morning at 9am. I was able to move my meeting in Rio and also called the airline to reschedule my interstate flight from Sao Paulo to Rio. We got to the airport Friday evening for our flight that is meant to take off at 8pm. We are supposed to be boarding at 7pm and there is still no plane. We were then told that the plane won't take off until 11pm and after more time told it won't take off until 9am the next morning. This now creates problems for my business meeting in Rio. After working with Air Canada customer service (who were not polite) they were able to change our flights to Rio instead of Sao Paulo so we could make our work meeting. By this time it was already 3am and if we had gone to the hotel we would have to turn around and leave 2 hours later to come back - so my husband and I slept at the airport. This was exetremely uncomfortable and we had an awful night of sleep. We finally got on the plane on Saturday morning at 9am (supposed to take off at 9:15 so we were late again) and we sat on the plane for 40 minutes with no movement. They finally announced over the speaker that there is a passenger on the plane who shouldn't be - and security was there to remove him.

a really cramped environment,Alan Cheng,Not Verified,"I used Air Canada to get from Hong Kong to Toronto-Pearson. Check in in HKG was OK, the check in workers were just ones from the Jardine company. However, there is nothing positive to say in this review other than the variety of movies in the inflight entertainment system (which crashed) and the baggage allowance. Service was not good. When you pressed the ""call attendant button"" you were ignored, or you were shouted at. My inflight entertainment system crashed. I pressed the button and nobody came for an hour. I cancelled and pressed again. The flight attendant shouted at me ""Did you press the button?"". I was gobsmacked. Generally, during meal service, their attitude was very demeaning and it seemed as if they did not want to serve us. Inflight meals on this flight were your typical airplane food. Nothing special. The seat in the plane was narrow. I used economy class and there were ten seats per row (3-4-3). This resulted in a really cramped environment. Reclining the seat was also useless. The tray tables were small and could only fit the tray and nothing else. Also, there was not much space for storage in the seat back pocket. Legroom was quite cramped, even though I am only 178 cm tall. Baggage handling at Toronto-Pearson was quite slow, despite the fact the gate (Terminal 1) was a short walk to immigration and baggage claim. I waited two hours for my bags to arrive, and I even saw the flight crew waiting even after I went to customs. Now, the only saving grace was the baggage allowance.

positive step forwards for Air Canada,Mark Murphy,VerifiedReview," Flying to Montreal via Toronto on the newer class of Air Canada's fleet was a much more pleasant experience than expected, due to my experiences on their older models. The seats are more comfortable, with more shoulder room, and the feeling of more privacy, now that they've gone for more of a cabin feel. the extra storage space for passports, phones, wallets etc. is a welcome addition. The TV screens are large and crisp, in HD (unlike the blurry cumbersome previous screens). Food was of a very good standard, and drinks selection was of a respectable range and standard. Service was friendly and attentive. All in all this is a significantly positive step forwards for Air Canada, despite the flight being late.

I could not afford the fee,Simon Camden,VerifiedReview,"  Cranbrook to Vancouver. While sitting at my gate waiting for my flight to begin boarding I received a phone call from Air Canada to advise me that my bag had already arrived at my destination. About 5 hours earlier I had asked if it might be possible to get on an earlier flight as I arrived at the airport before I expected when I bought my ticket a month earlier. I was told it would be possible, but that I would be charged a large fee. I declined as I could not afford the fee. It seems funny to me that Air Canada had lots of room on the earlier flight for my bag, but not me. Would it have cost them anything to let me take one of the empty seats on the flight before mine?

no reasoning with them,Steven Perreault,Not Verified,"We purchased tickets for our son and his friends with Singapore Airlines from Tokyo to Montreal. The LA to Montreal leg was with Air Canada. We had many choices for this second flight but we chose Air Canada because it is Canadian and because both airlines are star Alliance members. The layover in LAX was 10 hrs so we decided to purchase access to the Maple Leaf lounge in LAX. To be able to purchase access to the lounge, the ticket had to be a Flex or Latitude class ticket which it was. Air Canada refused the possibility of purchasing lounge access because the ticket is originally purchased through Singapore rather than Air Canada.

flights were operated to a high standard,D Collard,VerifiedReview,"  Air Canada, Halifax-Toronto-Victoria on 4 July 2016 in economy class. Ticket had been purchased as a Lufthansa ticket through the LH website as a three-part trip: Victoria to Geneva; Geneva to Halifax; and Halifax to Victoria. (The same combination of flights couldn't be found on the AC website.) YHZ-YYZ leg (2h20) was aboard a B767-200 which had started its journey at LHR (and was carrying a number of passengers continuing through from LHR). YYZ-YYJ leg (5h10) was aboard an A320. Both flights were full and operated to a high standard. Good legroom and space for carry-on baggage. FAs passed through the cabin often to offer water or juice. A lot of AVOD offerings, but always preceded by commercials. The worst intrusions of commercials were at the very start of both flights, after the safety briefing, presented not only on all cabin screens but also over the public-address system and on the classical music channels, where from time to time the commercials suddenly blared at more than double the normal volume - forcing you to pull out the ear-buds immediately. Air Canada's food offerings for sale on-board are poor (mostly junk food); but Canadians know that when taking domestic flights they need to eat beforehand. A few days after the flight, an Air Canada agent telephoned to say that an e-reader had been found near my seat on the YYZ-YYJ flight and asked if it might be mine (it wasn't). It was impressive that Air Canada was phoning all passengers seated in that area of the plane to see if it belonged to any of us.

We were supposed to fly from Seoul (ICN) to Washington IAD via Toronto on a United code share. Our flight from Seoul left late and arrived late, which caused a missed 7:30 connection at Toronto. Our request for 2 vegetarian meals was overlooked on this 13-hour flight. The seats were fine for us because we had a 3-person section and could lift the armrests and lean against each other. The flight would have been pretty uncomfortable next to a stranger for 13 hours because the seats are quite narrow. Also, the flight was about the driest I've ever been on - I left with a very dry mouth.

food was cold and super dry,Natalie P Shay,Not Verified,"Ottawa to Tokyo Haneda via Toronto. The Premium Economy product on the B777 aircraft is much poorer than the B787 we have previously experienced. The service was mediocre - one single flight attendant entirely handling the Premium Economy cabin which results in a slow service and many Premium Economy passengers served after the regular Economy cabin. It makes no sense when you paid for a Premium seat to get served at last. My food was cold and super dry because of the long waiting. I wasn’t even offered any drink while waiting for my meal. The Premium Economy arm rests were all sticky and not even cleaned properly when we boarded the flight. Upon departure, they won’t tag your baggage priority unless you specifically ask them.

$20 to select a regular seat,M Pearson,VerifiedReview,"  Los Angeles to Toronto with Air Canada. I have never seen an airline so concerned about squeezing money out of their customers. Purchase your ticket online and then pay $20 to select a regular seat - not a special seat, just a regular seat. Every checked bag (even from US to Canada) are charged which means every single flight I saw staff notify travelers that there is too much carry-on luggage and ask who would like to volunteer to have their bags checked at the gate. I have flown a lot of airlines but Air Canada is by far the worst.

all in all a good experience,G Fremuel,VerifiedReview,"  Was assisted by Concierge to make my connexion in Montreal due to a late departure from Quebec City. Kudos to the Concierge service from Ottawa (my base) and Montreal who monitored the status of the flights and planned for contingencies. This service is one of greatest value added of Air Canada for high tier customers. Air Canada uses the old Blue Pod configuration seat on this route. 1-1-1 in Business Class. Seat quite comfortable and allows some sleep for this type of leg (6-8 hours). Seat 1 A on this aircraft does not allow you to have a window (or you have to look behind you). It is a good and comfortable seat nonetheless - close to the washrooms if that's what you are looking for (and if you are not afraid of being bothered by noise from the galleys). Air Canada  Achille's heal continues to be the quality of service onboard. While the young crew members are pleasant, helpful and professional, older crew (particularly YUL-based) tend to be less nice and almost discourteous.

gave us wrong information,H Franklin,VerifiedReview,"  Thunder Bay to Dublin via Newark. Our origin flight was delayed getting into Toronto so we had to run to make the boarding time for our destination flight. Although, we made it to the flight they would not allow us on because our bags did not make it.  We waited 2 hours from 11pm to 1am to get our hotel voucher, and had to wait 24 hours for the next flight. We were not allowed to get our bags. Our hotel was for one night with an 11am checkout, so from 11am to 11pm we had to wait at the airport. We get to our final destination, and one of our bags actually did make it on the original flight so had been waiting for us there, but the other somehow didn't make it on either. We then waited 48 hours to get our second bag delivered to us. So, we were without much of luggage for 72 hours (great way to start a trip in dirty clothes). It was strange how we flew to Dublin on a plane that didn't have any of our baggage on it when the day before we were told the that we weren't allowed to board because our bags wouldn't be travelling with us. Flight back from Dublin via Newark. We had a 3 hour layover which turned into 4.5 hours due to a delay. Then the captain advised that due to a navigation system failure on the plan it will be delayed another 2 hours. Two hours later the captain comes back and says the flight is cancelled. Customer service agents tell us it was cancelled due to weather so no vouchers (weird how the captain had just told us otherwise). We know we missed our connecting flight so asked for hotel (it was 6pm). They make us wait until 11pm to fly Toronto, then, I wait there until 2am to get hotel voucher.

"unhelpful, callous, rude",Paula Schiller,VerifiedReview,"  Sunday, May 15th. Air Canada flight 7374 from Toronto to Dulles. Traveling with family of 6. My mother became ill on the first leg of our flight from Dublin to Toronto. Was transported via ambulance from Toronto Airport to hospital. My sister rode in the ambulance. I stayed to get bags, and to deal with another unnecessary problem - my 80 year old father, in a wheelchair, and my two sons, aged 21 and 23 were going to go on to Dulles as planned but one of my sons was bumped from the flight. We paid full price in January, we picked seats, checked in, etc. No idea why he was bumped. We go to gate to try to get him on the flight. My father is stressed, my boys needed to assist him, handle luggage, get the 3 of them home, keep him calm, etc. The reps at the gate were unhelpful, callous, rude.  We were vacating seats for the medical emergency, there were clearly seats available, it was a no brainer. Apparantly Air Canada staff can do nothing but look at the computer screen. It took me 2.5 hours at the airport to find someone high enough up the food chain from Air Canada to get my son on the flight and he was put on at the last minute. I should've been with my mother at the hospital but had to deal with this problem that shouldn't have been a problem at all. Also had trouble getting bags off the flight (they pulled the wrong bags twice). They rescheduled us to fly the next afternoon, then bumped my mother to a later flight and notified via email. She couldn't travel on her own. I spent hours trying to reach a customer service rep (no answer - busy signal over and over, then cut off by auto reply machine). When I got a rep he couldn't do anything said we had to go to the airport to deal with it. Finally gave up. Went to United. They were dealt with getting us on a flight, wheelchair service, etc. in less than 30 minutes of time.

legroom in row 18 exceptional,D Martin,Not Verified,"Our return flight from Paris started off on the wrong foot when I tried to check-in online the day before our flight. Although I prepaid for preferred seats at $200 ($100 each), when I tried to check-in we were no longer assigned to these seats, rather we were assigned seats in row 57. When I tried to select preferred seats online it prompted me to pay again. I contacted Air Canada via Twitter and they explained the change was due to an aircraft change, which was wrong as it was a B777ER high density aircraft, which is the type always used on this route. They ended up assigning us to preferred seats 18H/J (rather than 18J/K that I booked), but it was poor customer service that I had to contact them after paying for confirmed seats, and for not being notified of the change in advance. In speaking with the gentlemen in seat 18k, he indicated he was upgraded to the preferred seat for having Super Elite status with AC. Paying passengers should not be bumped for Super Elite passengers. He was a nice man and ended up moving to the middle row which was completely empty, which leads me to wonder why they bumped us out of our seats for him, when there were many other preferred seats available - bad customer service Air Canada. The legroom in row 18 is exceptional, better than Premium Economy actually, which comes in handy considering the lack of width in the 17 inch seats. I usually fly AC, but this has left a bad taste in my mouth. FAs on the return flight were rude and we felt like we were inconveniencing them.

Porter got a whole lot more friendly,S Radine,VerifiedReview,"  I fly with Air Canada extensively throughout Canada. When I first started taking this route (from St. John's to Halifax) they were flying an E90. Which was a lovely plane, lots of luggage space, overhead compartments and space.

Today, I have been told that in the 2 weeks since my last flight they have downgraded to a Q400 turboprop plane. This plane unlike the last two has nothing, small cabin, small space, no in cabin entertainment and to add more discomfort it will take an additional half hour to make it to its destination. flights to and from Halifax are consistently full, so clearly this is not a space issue.

Economy was full with 3-4-3 configuration and Premium Economy was almost empty - people from economy moving to PE (Economy Plus) seating there, the curtain open between economy and Premium economy. Now they have more Business Class seats with the bathroom in the back in economy for Economy and Economy Plus passengers. Never again Air Canada or Air China who have downgraded to a cheap product and charging the same of others whom are offering a much better product.

seats are far too narrow,H Cram,VerifiedReview,  London Heathrow to Calgary. Everything that is said by reviewers about the 3x3x3 seat configuration in economy class on the Boeing 787 is true. The seats are far too narrow for comfortable travel. I am an Air Canada frequent flyer and had the front row of economy class on the aisle - travelling with family instead of business for a change. Apart from having to deal with the very cramped middle seat person I was regularly bumped by the FAs and their trolley throughout the flight due to the very narrow aisles. I would rather fly on an older Boeing 777 or A330 then have to suffer this again. To cap it all off the FA gave me a cracked cup which leaked all over my lap. She apparently would have gone to get me some tissues but her colleague was blocking the way - possibly my worst ever flight with Air Canada.,14th April 2016,Business,Economy Class,LHR to YYC,April 2016,1,1,3,3,4,0,1,[],0,13.0,6,2.1666666666666665,-0.05,0.041547619047619055,"['heathrow', 'everything', 'reviewers', 'seat', 'configuration', 'economy', 'class', 'boeing', 'true', 'seats', 'far', 'narrow', 'comfortable', 'travel', 'frequent', 'flyer', 'front', 'row', 'economy', 'class', 'aisle', 'travelling', 'family', 'instead', 'business', 'change', 'apart', 'deal', 'cramped', 'middle', 'seat', 'person', 'regularly', 'bumped', 'fas', 'trolley', 'throughout', 'due', 'narrow', 'aisles', 'rather', 'fly', 'older', 'boeing', 'suffer', 'cap', 'fa', 'gave', 'cracked', 'cup', 'leaked', 'lap', 'apparently', 'gone', 'tissues', 'colleague', 'blocking', 'way', 'possibly', 'worst', 'ever']","['seats', 'far', 'narrow']",pos
not family friendly,Graeme Brown,VerifiedReview,"  Cramped and not family friendly, are my resounding thoughts. I was travelling with my family, on route from Florida from Toronto to Heathrow, and Air Canada were offering reasonable prices at the time of looking. On booking the flight we requested a bassinet for our baby. We didn't get one despite repeated requests at the airport and on the plane. No attempt was made to accommodate this request. The seats on the plane with capacity for bassinets didn't have babies in them. There were other families with babies that were refused a bassinet. We are frequent fliers and I've never had this issue with an airline before. I was repeatedly hit with the trolleys as the cabin crew made their way up and down the aisles and also by other customers. The issue appears to have been caused by the introduction of an additional seat, so on the 787 the configuration of seating is 3-3-3 in economy. I spoke to the cabin crew about it, as I was unhappy at not being able to get any rest, and on a few occasions when I was holding our baby, his head was also knocked. The cabin crew also expressed their concerns as the reduced width makes their job that much more difficult and that this configuration will be the norm going forward.",11th April 2016,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to LHR,April 2016,1,2,0,0,2,0,3,[],0,8.0,4,2.0,0.375,-0.002777777777777783,"['cramped', 'family', 'friendly', 'resounding', 'thoughts', 'travelling', 'family', 'route', 'florida', 'heathrow', 'offering', 'reasonable', 'prices', 'time', 'looking', 'booking', 'requested', 'bassinet', 'baby', 'despite', 'repeated', 'requests', 'airport', 'plane', 'attempt', 'accommodate', 'request', 'seats', 'plane', 'capacity', 'bassinets', 'babies', 'families', 'babies', 'refused', 'bassinet', 'frequent', 'fliers', 'never', 'issue', 'airline', 'repeatedly', 'hit', 'trolleys', 'cabin', 'crew', 'way', 'aisles', 'customers', 'issue', 'appears', 'caused', 'introduction', 'additional', 'seat', 'configuration', 'seating', 'economy', 'spoke', 'cabin', 'crew', 'unhappy', 'able', 'rest', 'occasions', 'holding', 'baby', 'head', 'knocked', 'cabin', 'crew', 'expressed', 'concerns', 'reduced', 'width', 'makes', 'job', 'much', 'difficult', 'configuration', 'norm', 'going', 'forward']","['family', 'friendly']",neg
business class luxury is lacking,N Huawei,VerifiedReview,"  Wanted to try the newish Air Canada direct route from Amsterdam to Toronto. The plane was extremely old (probably over 20 years), and it showed in the cabin interior and design. The Business Class cabin was the old herringbone layout 1-2-1. The seat was a bit torn and dirty, again showing how aged the aircraft is. The crew were pleasant enough, and I just happen to meet them prior to the flight as we went through security together. We joked a bit, and they were quite friendly. The onboard service provided by the crew were also good. However, the food was basic, particularly for a flight over 8hrs. There was a hot meal service, portions were small. I had stuffed chicked served with rice, which was preceded by a nice seafood salad, and followed by a cheese platter. The champagne was ly bitter and undrinkable. The orange juice was not fresh but came out of a Minute Maid carton, unbefitting for the highest class Air Canada provides. The pre-landing snack was a very disappointing cold platter of sliced chicken breasts. The water on offer (Naya) didn't exactly reflect luxury. The one thing that appeared luxurious was the amenity kit with Escents toiletries. I would not recommend this for the extremely high price charged for business class. The quality and luxury of business class is simply lacking.

treat their loyal customers better,Scott Bruce,VerifiedReview,"  I was booked on a very tired Air Canada aircraft with poor service from Halifax to Toronto. It started with the booking where, as a Aeroplan Elite Flyer, I was not given a choice of seat selection (which we used to have in the past) so asked for a widow or aisle and got a middle seat. Aircraft was dirty and the only redeeming quality of the flight was the decent entertainment system. However you have to sit thru multiple commercials with every selection, even a 20 minute TV show (so the commercials were almost as long as the program). For over 10 years I have been flying steadily with Air Canada/Aeroplan mostly internationally but domestic as well.

disappointment with Air Canada,M Thompson,Not Verified,"I moved to Sydney from Canada and flew with Air Canada. I had my carry-on luggage approved at the beginning of my trip with the proper tags. On a connecting flight, I was told I would have to check one of my bags at the gate because the plane was full. Once on the plane, I had an entire row to myself and thought it was very strange that I was forced to check a bag onto a plane that was clearly not full. Once I arrived in Sydney, my bag checked at the gate did not come out with the rest of the baggage. I spoke with 5 or more airline reps to try to figure out what happened to my bag over the course of a couple days and received different answers each time. In the beginning my bag was just missing and no one could tell me where it was. If I have been forced to check a bag unnecessarily it should not just ""go missing"". Later in the week I heard varying other stories and eventually realized my bag was just not put on my flight at all. I understand that airlines cannot always fit all baggage, but the least Air Canada could have done in this situation is to track where the bags are in order to avoid unnecessary stress. I eventually got my luggage but had to go through a lot of confusion and stress over it. I was moving across the world and did not need the added stress of a bag being missing. I was also approved by an agent to be reimbursed $100 for missing items after submitting claim with receipts.

the lunch was very good,Tom Lewis,Not Verified,"Heathrow to Toronto with Air Canada. Check-in and security took 10 minutes in Terminal 2 - great.

Friendly cabin crew served a hot breakfast and subsequently a full lunch : breakfast was not great but the lunch was very good with some good wines available.

a dismal experience,M Hirst,Not Verified,"I flew with Air Canada using Airmiles and it was a dismal experience. On the flight there, the food took 2.5 hours to make its way down the plane - extremely painful as it was right around dinner time. When we arrived in Toronto, the baggage took almost an hour to arrive. On my flight home, they overbooked it (the third flight in a row that they had overbooked that evening). The person at the gate was rude and impatient when explaining the situation to passengers who had paid to be on that flight. In my opinion, it is ridiculous to overbook flights, and it should not be the norm of an airline's practice. The flight attendants were harried and frustrated (understandably), and the airplane took off 25 minutes late. When I arrived in Calgary, the baggage took a long time to arrive again, the belt stopping several times even when bags were on the ramp, making it so passengers could see their bags, but not pick them up until the belt started moving.

very generous legroom,S Griffiths,Not Verified,"Toronto to Vancouver. Air Canada ground staff in YYZ not as friendly as YVR but I guess it is a much busier station. I again paid $60 extra to book a preferred seat. This time it was 13A on Boeing 787. This seat is in the Premium economy cabin. I was made aware of the fact that this was not *Premium Economy* service as Air Canada does not offer that class of service domestically. It is simply a charge to sit in this section of the cabin. It was worth the money for a 4.5 hour flight. The small cabin is very private, with very generous legroom, seat width and comfort. It also means that you are the first to be offered food and beverage service and among the first to deplane at destination. Buy onboard  choices were in my opinion reasonably priced and a very nice selection. Flight attendants attentive yet realised it was an evening flight and many people just wanted to nap. Two trolley services were offered as well as a couple of water runs. Superbowl was being played as we were flying and the flight deck made two announcements to give the score at the end of halftime and the final score. Perfect, rather than making copious announcements every time the score changed. Cabin crew checking the cabin to make sure everyone was looked after, but respecting the fact that many were sleeping.

Paid $60 in advance for a preferred seat 18K which was worth every penny. Tons of legroom. My first time on a 787 and it was very impressive. Excellent features and very quiet. Flight Attendants very well groomed, friendly and efficient. I do find it annoying that on a four hour North American flight on a full service airline that the only food offering is buy onboard. However, having said that the pricing and quality of the items cannot be faulted. I prepaid for a meal and snack voucher for $7 Canadian. For that I choose a Swiss cheese / crackers package which had a very generous offering of cheese with it, and a delicious Montreal smoked meat sandwich on rye with pickles. It would have cost more than that just about anywhere else. Buying it in advance is quite a saving over the listed prices and the flight crew knew I had done so and offered up choices in advance before things ran out.

sleeping was no problem,Jonathan Hart,Not Verified,"Toronto to Frankfurt on an overnight,  checking in was easy with a separate section for Business, Premium class flyers.

If it was a bad thing, I couldn't sit beside my wife who I was also on this trip, so I sat behind her on the right side of the plane. To sit kinda beside is taking an isle seat but it's no window seat, plus because the pods are positioned in the pod style, being comfortable in your chair would be hard to chit chat to your traveling partner, so it's down to preference. Food was great, and the drinks were non stop. The bed was 180 degree flat bed and comfortable. There were no PJ's provided like other airlines. I am 6ft 2 and did not find it cramped and sleeping was no problem. I did read reviews in advanced that sitting in the last back seat of each section of Business, provides a bit more storage space, and it was true. So if you book in advanced and select your seat, try for these. But overall, no complaints. The flight was spacious, pods give that cozy effect.

Leg space is really limited ,Yoko Takemura,Not Verified,"Air Canada's service was, from beginning to end, appalling. On the flight from Tokyo Haneda to NYC via Toronto one of the flight attendants treated passengers as if they were inferior to her. Before takeoff she ordered passengers to close their overhead compartment (isn't this her responsibility?). At one point, there was a lady with a crying baby. This flight attendant told her to put her two large bags up in the compartment in a rude and apathetic manner. The lady was too short to do so, and she was alone, so she had to get a tall passenger next to her to do it for her. On another occasion, she came over and reached over to turn off my reading light without any warning, which I was using to do my knitting. As she reached over, she spilt water on my boyfriend's leg, she apologised and said ""give it 2 minutes and it'll dry."" The two male flight attendants were also rude - when handing out inflight meals, they would stare in silence when passengers were trying to decide what meal to pick and when collecting trays they would just hold out their hands, expecting passengers to hand over your tray as well as other passengers if they were sleeping. On the ground, before take off I politely asked an Air Canada staff member if my boyfriend and I could sit next to each other since our seats were one in front of the other. He seemed overly confident that it was possible and told me he would call my name out. I waited until the last minute, after people started boarding, for him to call my name to find out that he found an aisle seat 9 rows away with no change to the other middle seat we initially had. I understand an aisle seat is great when traveling alone, but this was the opposite of what we wanted - we were now 9 rows away.

supposed to swim to Victoria,Bill Jackson,Not Verified,"Our inbound Lufthansa flight was late leaving Frankfurt and we missed our Air Canada connection to Victoria from Vancouver.

extra money is worth it,Mike Palmer,Not Verified,"First time flying Premium Economy with Air Canada on a Boeing 787. Having used British Airways Premium Economy on the London to Toronto route, I was keen to compare the two. Check in was not at Heathrow as I was hubbing from Germany - the new terminal is great other than the trek to the gate. Priority boarding was quick and easy. On board, the Premium Economy cabin is great - just three rows creating a quiet and intimate environment. A menu was offered along with decent hot towels and juice or water. (in plastic cups) The food was at best average with either cheese pasta of red chicken curry on offer. Neither were my idea of an upgraded meal service. No bar service before a late lunch was offered and so a pre dinner drink was served (when asked) along with the meal. Two T&Cs were offered along with a drink after dinner. The AVOD / entertainment was excellent - probably the highlight! A large screen akin to a tablet with easy navigation. The seat was comfy too though being in the front row meant (bizarrely) that there was no foot stall. The crew were ok - nothing special, but did make an effort to engage. We took off late and landed early so no complaints there. Like BA, the Premium Economy experience morphed into economy for the snack. Another hot towel with the (Economy) hot savory slice merely served on a china plate with two chocolates. There were nice touches using decent glass for drinks, tablecloths on the table etc etc But then odd things such as serving the boarding drink in plastic, poor food choice or a low quality snack on china. All in all, the extra money is worth it to me for the priority boarding, more space and a decent level of service. I think BA has the edge only because the product is more mature.

failed on multiple occasions,Omar Khan,Not Verified,"Calgary to Los Angeles via Vancouver. I have flown Air Canada multiple times and normally never had bad service, but this experience consisted of a 26-hour hold up in Vancouver International Airport. While the initial delay was due to factors beyond Air Canada's control, our family was then overbooked on multiple flights, transferred to a United Airlines flight, only to be rejected from boarding that flight due to Air Canada not transferring our bag (United Airlines stated that without our bag, they would not let us board the flight due to liability concerns). We then had multiple conversations with various Air Canada employees, one of whom in particular was aggressive and confrontational, telling me at one point that I should consider myself lucky that she was spending her time dealing with me. She also lied to us on multiple occasions. Air Canada eventually offered us a hotel and a flight via Seattle the next morning, and then did a complete about face after we accepted, refusing to honour the offer they made less than an hour before. The reason our bag was not transferred to United Airlines (as we discovered when we went to collect it after the last flight for the day had left from Vancouver Airport without us on board), was that it had already flown to Los Angeles earlier that day. Ironically, we did eventually end up flying from Vancouver to Seattle, and then taking Alaskan Airlines from Seattle to Los Angeles the next day (as Air Canada had offered us shortly after the United Airlines fiasco). I tried to follow this issue up with Air Canada's customer relations department, but unfortunately they failed on multiple occasions to even recognize my concerns adequately (for example, the reply about my concern with not being allowed to board the United Airlines due to lost baggage was to state that the ""aim [of Star Alliance] was to build an airline alliance which would improve the travel experience of customers.""

Zoning hampers boarding ,Dagmar Borchardt,Not Verified,"London to Vancouver. Why there is zone boarding no one really knows nor understands as every traveller is confused about when to board. Zoning hampers boarding greatly as it does not consider row numbers only the ticket price as common denominator. Zone 5 by far what most people have is the last, but since row numbers are all over the place there is a long line-up throughout the plane, since row 19 or 40 are boarding at the same time. Food on Air Canada flights is tasteless. Flight attendants on this flight were not helpful when asked for things such as special meals.

2 hours for a beverage refill,D D'Arcy,Not Verified,"First of all it is super silly to complain when you have a seat in the business class cabin. However, considering what I paid for that seat - what is Air Canada even thinking? It seems like they haven’t flown these planes before or have anyone on staff that has even one flight of experience on their resume. It began at check-in in Columbus where no less than 5 agents stood looking at their computers and doing their best to check in two passengers in the span of 35 minutes. I was embarrassed for them and luckily we had arrived early so we weren’t stressed with time constraints. I am on a flight from Toronto to New Delhi, sitting in 3G with the seat all the way back, attempting to balance myself while typing this, sitting up, on a half-way reclined seat. God bless the flight attendants – I just asked one for help to put my seat back to a semi-seated position and she started pressing the buttons on my seat controls and said, “It’s not working? Well, do you want duty free?” The “chair moving system” is apparently turned off for the moment as they “reboot the entertainment system.”  There is no way to put my seat up and one of the flight attendants acknowledged this fact. I tuned in to the inflight programming before takeoff and that was the last time that it actually worked. I was able to begin the “Diary of a Teenage Girl” but that is no longer a choice on the movie selection. This is a 14 hour flight and we are now only able to access 5 movie choices from the New Releases. This was after the crew attempted to reset the service for two hours. The reset apparently takes at least 40 minutes to accomplish but still never works. The service in business class is poor - I waited 2 hours for a beverage refill during dinner and finally I just got up and walked back to the drink station and refilled it myself. My husband and I – since we’re on our honeymoon – asked for champagne. For the first round crew members presented us with a glass but it wasn’t even chilled. I realize in the grand scheme of life and love and loss this matters about as much as a cricket being run over by a car but  the tickets for this part of the plane are expensive and the service/inflight entertainment/food are all awful? Please stand by while I make another useless observation - there were only 14 people in a 32-seat business class area. Less than half of the plane is full in this “service level” and they can’t keep up with drink orders?

frustrating and time consuming,S Lee,Not Verified,"Booked Air Canada return ticket from Vancouver to Osaka under promotion offer of additional 7500 bonus miles. Just about a week before departure, received an email from Air Canada about flight schedule change. Since I wasn't able to match the sudden change, I called Air Canada. Air Canada agent suggested a different route which including over night stay in Osaka airport and stopping over in Korea- Incheon airport. The agent confirmed I will be keeping 7500 Bonus miles as Air Canada is the one who changed the flight schedule significantly at last minute. But the agent didn't want to offer any hotel option for me who had to stay overnight in Kansai Osaka airport. After long argument, agent told me Air Canada will cover the over night stay as long as I stay in one of the airport hotels. After the trip, for long 6 months, I had to constantly call and email Air Canada in order to get the hotel bill refund and 7500 miles. Each time, Air Canada agent promised that I will receive my refund and asked me to simply wait. When it comes to bonus miles, Air Canada agent would simply transfer me to Aeroplan saying it is not their job. In the end, Aeroplan agent organized extra investigation and confirmed that Air Canada is the one who needs to sort out everything as this was special case. Which means I wasted more time by constantly transferred to Aeroplan agents. After more faxing, emails and calls to Air Canada, finally I was able to reach their refund department. At this point, Refund department agent refused to offer neither full refund nor bonus miles. He mentioned I am only eligible for up to $175 per night for hotel stay - I argued that no one informed me about $175, and also I had no choice but booking more expensive room as most of airport hotels were nearly sold out at the time of booking. And my room was one of the very last ones. For bonus miles, he said he will offer me 4000 miles to show me good will!

the worst experience,Dani Lapointe,Not Verified,"My boyfriend and I recently took a flight with Air Canada from Ottawa to Vancouver and had the worst experience we have ever had on a flight. We had arrived at the airport with ample time before our flight, we had already checked in online and prepaid for our suitcase to be checked. All we had to do was print off our boarding passes and check our bag. We waited in line for an atrocious amount of time (there weren’t even many people in line) as Air Canada employees socialized with each other instead of getting people through in a timely fashion. When we finally got up to the counter, they told us we had missed the deadline for baggage check by 2 minutes. The employee were so rude and kept emphasizing that we were late and needed to arrive earlier, use the kiosks instead, etc., as he clearly saw us waiting in line for more than 20 minutes. We checked in our suitcase at a baggage storage unit in the airport overnight instead for $8, and rushed through the airport in order to make it to our flight on time. We got to the gate as they were just finishing boarding our flight. We were about to board when the flight attendants tell us they have no more room for carry-on baggage, and they need to start checking our carry-ons. That alone would have been frustrating enough, but that, added to the fact that we were just denied the ability to check our bag and had rushed around the airport in order to store it, was downright infuriating.

much room for improvement in the product,Vineet Bapat,Not Verified,"My wife and I flew Air Canada from Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver and then back on the same route two weeks later. Prior to the flight, I was a bit concerned about the quality of service we would get compared to Qantas and Air New Zealand, which we have flown before. The crew (flight deck and flight attendants) on both legs was actually quite good - responsive and polite. We had a slight delay due to a minor technical malfunction leaving Sydney, and the captain kept us well informed. I appreciated the frequent ""water runs"" by flight attendants throughout the flight - important to keep hydrated during those 14 hours. However, there are definitely things that Air Canada could enhance for this sector: Toronto passengers flying to Sydney have an awkward flight transformation whereby they are on a domestic flight up to Vancouver with North American service standards for food. They are entitled to free food because they are flying as international passengers, however, we had to inform or alert the flight attendants of our status (although we found out they already had this information!), which was awkward to do, particularly if your seatmate was a domestic passenger flying only to Vancouver. Would it be too much to ask if international passengers could be treated the same as those with special meal requests, who are served discretely prior to the regular meal service - On the way back, we had to clear customs in Vancouver, collect our baggage and then put it on the luggage belt for the continuing flight to Toronto. There is a long walk from customs to where the bags are put on the belt. The most disconcerting thing about this was that we barely had time to use the washroom before having to immediately line up to board the flight to Toronto - this was unlike the much more contained but efficient process on the way to Sydney, where we deplaned and then reboarded in the same general area.

uncomfortable Boeing 787,Anthony Chapman,Not Verified,"Just completed a 2-week tour of Rajasthan in India. Flew from Nova Scotia to Udaipur and back. Half of the connecting flights were Air Canada and half with Jet Airways, an Indian carrier. As always, cabin service is better on Asian airlines. But Air Canada has newer aircraft and outstanding flight deck crews who fear no weather. So I was looking forward to a homeward leg from Dubai to Toronto on AC057, which is serviced by new Boeing 787. What a disappointment! I am 6 ft tall and weight about 200 lbs. The lady on my left side was a small, wider person. We could not fit our shoulders across the seat back space provided, so it was a very uncomfortable 14 hours on this non-stop leg.

good flight in Boeing 787,Paul Smith,Not Verified,Had a good flight in this new Boeing 787. The lower pressurization makes a real difference in the overall comfort level. The seat arrangements have plenty of room. Seats are more comfortable than those of the Boeing 777 business class pods. The large screen was a real bonus. My major complaint is with the food.

do not seem to care,B Yamamoto,Not Verified,"I had flown to Vancouver for a medical conference and was booked to fly home (Toronto) from Vancouver on AC 180 on November 29 and had taken time to grab an aisle seat 24 hrs earlier with online pre checkin, so had a seat on this flight , when found out the flight had been cancelled only 4 hrs before departure. Curiously there was another Air Canada flight scheduled at the same time for departure but was told the plane was fully booked. I did notice at the time of checking in the plane was clearly not fully booked (AC 180). The only way to get home was through Montreal which added an additional 3 hours to the flight. How they can cancel a routine route flight full of people and and sub in a plane that obviously had smaller capacity and not able to take all of the booked passengers, re-routing them instead, is beyond belief. The agent did not seem to feel that this was in any way unreasonable even though I had a booked seat on the cancelled flight. So a 5 hour flight turned into an 8 hour flight which would not have been too bad other than it took another 2 hrs to get to the gate in Toronto and get my bag (1hr 15 mins of waiting for the bag). It took over 10 hrs for a flight that I have taken forty or more times before with no problem for 5 hrs. I have flown to and from Vancouver to Toronto for 25 yrs or more often twice yearly and usually on Air Canada's main competitor and have never been bumped from a flight and never waited 75 mins for my bags.

Tonight we were delayed by 6 hours. The delays, such as this evening, have been due to mechanical issues. I can appreciate valuing everyone's safety, however the volume and length of delays has forced us to view Air Canada as unreliable. We have missed out on nights of hard-earned vacations, and even worse, time spent with family. A few food vouchers for airport food, at airport food prices is simply not sufficient for the repeated inconvenience and frustration we have experienced.

terrible experience booking,Abi Mannarn,Not Verified,"Haven't managed to fly with them yet - but had a terrible experience booking my flight. Was charged for the flights and everything was good to go, got the confirmation through and was really excited. Then my account got charged a 2nd time for the flights - an extra $1,200 was taken out of my account. This lead to my bank blocking the card because it put me in negative $1000. After calling Air Canada help desk to find out what had happened, I was told that it was a technical glitch and the money would be released in 7 days and there was nothing that could be done to help.

double check your seats,Ingelise MacDonald,Not Verified,"Trying to book seats or have a family seated together was frustrating and only partially successful. My daughter, so inlay and infant grandson flew from the east coast to the west coast in October. Two short flights and one longer one. They booked and paid for seats on the long flight. Checking in 24 hours in advance, they saw the seats they had purchased had been changed and they were seated apart on all 3 flights. A call to Air Canada corrected the problem, they thought. The morning of the trip they checked online and they had been moved apart on all three flights. A complaint on Twitter got Air Canada's attention and in discussion with an agent they were able to be seated together on two of the flights, but the third one was full so they were now at opposite ends of the plane. They were not able to get the seats they had originally paid for. Now unsure of the competence of the staff, we went to the airport early and the seats had been changed again! How is this possible? They were reassigned together on the flight they had paid for their seats. They were moved together into the last two seats together on one of the short flights but they were apart on the other short flight. This is inexcusable. Who wants to travel alone with an infant?

a downgraded experience,A Victor,Not Verified,"Unfortunately, I will never fly Air Canada again as long as I can help it. Living in Hawaii requires a long flight to any designation outside the island chain. I have flown Hawaiian mostly to California destinations and have never been sorry about that choice. I always slept comfortably on red eye flights. However, I was in pain and shifting constantly en route to Los Angeles on the first leg of journey because seating was too close. I am only 5'6 and about 125 lbs so it should not be a problem. I couldn't sleep at all. Then, in Los Angeles, as we were boarding a empty plane that was not even close to being sold out, we were stopped by a flight attendant who lifted both our regulation size carry ons. She smugly said, ""if this wasn't a full flight we couldn't let this bag on."" Um, why bother singling us out? Why bother even mentioning it? It was wholly irrelevant. She was just rude. When we got to Toronto, we were in more pain and really uncomfortable because we were on the same aircraft type as the flight across the pacific (two rows of 3 seats, narrow body). The Air Canada folks were really unfriendly and downright couldn't be bothered throughout our traveling. It wasn't isolated. After a 6 hour layover at Toronto, we discovered we weren't seated next to one another on our 10 hour flight to Munich. We tried to get them changed and they were (sort of) but then they messed that up and the double booked our seats. So when we got on the plane we didn't have any seats. The kicker is that I went to ask a question of a flight attendant she pretty much ripped my head off and was extremely confrontational. All I wanted was her to tell the other flight attendant an important piece of info while they were sorting out the seat issue. Our flight to Munich on the brand new airbus was amazing. If you have a chance to fly the dream plane do, but the crew were still unfriendly. When we flew home we flew with Lufthansa and it was great. Back on Air Canada from Vancouver, BC to Hawaii - awful. The flight attendants were dressed in cheap looking uniforms. They left the lights on almost the entire time so we couldn't sleep (night flight) and they kept the air on the entire time. Everyone around us froze. There was no TV, music, or any entertainment at all. They told us we needed to download an app after we were on plane where there is no internet. I don't care I wanted to sleep anyway, but it was definitely a downgraded experience. I don't usually care about the fitness of the plane as long as it gets me to my destination, but this one was run down completely with holes in the carpet.

legroom was more than sufficient,S Neuhauser,Not Verified,"Red eye flight from Vancouver to Toronto was on time. As I was aware that Air Canada's Y-class on this particular aircraft and route is extremely cramped, I booked a ""preferred seat"" at the front. This cost an extra 60 CAD but was more than worth it: These seats are used as ""premium economy"" seats on international flights on this particular B777. Legroom was more than sufficient, as was the seat width. Catering is not complementary, and can only be purchased via credit card - no cash. I don't think that is a good policy as not all credit cards are accepted by Air Canada, at least mine wasn't (my Hotel did, as did the grocer beside the Hotel...). But it is possible to book a meal online ahead of your flight which I did on my way back. This worked just fine and I recommend this service as you pay less than on the aircraft.

contrasting flights out and back,Steve Parkin,Not Verified,"Contrasting flights out and back. Going out Heathrow to Vancouver, the plane was packed and it felt packed. People seem to be let on with cabin bags as big as my main case (it's not only Air Canada who let them get away with it). As a result, the lockers were full, meaning having to squish bags under the seat in front. The result is a real squeeze. We spoke to the crew, and they said AC have removed a galley and set of toilets so they can squeeze in more seats. This makes meal-heating arduous for them and conditions cramped. We were actually dreading the return trip, but it was far less packed, and there was a good 6"" extra leg-room. It really makes a difference. I know airlines have to maximise profit, but if they get known as the airline with cramped seats, people will steer clear. On the way out, my entertainment system didn't work, except to show a map. No films, TV, music. On the way back, it all worked. Food going out was OK at best, with the last part being a wrap which dribbled all over my top. Probably my own fault for not knowing how to eat. Food coming back was excellent, really liked it. I'm glad to have had both trips. Sometimes things go well, sometimes not. The crew going out were nice, and clearly stressed because we weren't the only ones feeling crammed in.

Air Canada still cares,T Eldem,Not Verified,"Montreal to São Paulo via Toronto with Air Canada. Smooth check-in assisted by two very pleasant agents. First leg was on a tired looking aircraft but service from the Flight Service Director was fabulous. Service consisted of snacks and beverages as this was a short jump. Flight left and arrived on time. Second leg was delayed by almost 2 hours and was on an even more tired looking Boeing 67. It is time Air Canada replaced these vintage birds.

The service was good and the meal was of reasonable quality. Washrooms was another piece of proof of the aircraft's age but they were kept relatively clean.

Inflight entertainment the worst,Peter Spence,Not Verified,"On the outward flight, Heathrow to Vancouver, we were unimpressed by friendliness of cabin crew.

Again they ran out of the meat option so could only have vegetarian. When I asked who to complain to I was given a business card at the end of the flight.

A321 business class is poor,Clifton van Putten,Not Verified,"We were rebooked on the Air Canada redeye from San Francisco to Toronto after the United Airlines connector was delayed 4 hours, thus causing us to miss our original daytime flight. There is no Air Canada service desk at SFO behind security, so we were fortunate to find an active departure gate with an Air Canada agent who helped us confirm our rescheduled flight arrangements for later that evening. United were unable to issue the onward boarding passes at our origin city on the rescheduled Air Canada flights, so it is a good thing we found an agent willing to help us. If we had showed at the gate for the flight that night with no boarding passes, we would have likely been out of luck because initially, Air Canada could not find our tickets! United had made a mistake in the rebooking, so it took numerous calls from the Air Canada agent to United to find them and reissue our boarding passes. When this was finally accomplished, we decided to purchase an upgrade to business class since we wanted to get some sleep on the overnight flight. Mistake! The product on the A321 in business class is poor, with poorly padded seats, and a miserable level of decline. Didn't sleep more than a few minutes at a time, as doing so caused my head to flop around like a bobble head doll when I began to doze off. Overall, business class was a waste of money. Though the ground service crew in San Francisco were unfailingly polite and accomodating, we should have just remained in coach as we were originally booked.

pretty good value for money ,D Bracegirdle,Not Verified,"In general Air Canada do a good job with their transatlantic flights and represent pretty good value for money (currently undercutting Air Transat on many flights).

They seem to have a consistent problem in my experience of boarding in a timely manner (nearly all my flights have left a little late).  The food is generally good, and the drink service on my last flight was regular, generous and friendly. The downsides - the last 2 times I have flown with them they messed up my meal orders. The time before last they did not have a gluten free option as I had requested. The last time they gave me a gluten free meal with chicken in it. I am a fusspot gluten free/veggie (which had been noted on the agent website's booking form), luckily my wife had the vegetarian meal which happened to be gluten free. Their official response - they can only cater for one dietary requirement. Sad to see this in the 21st century, so if you don't fit into a particular box, bring your own food along to avoid disappointment. Fair do's to Air Canada though, they do keep offering money off when they mess up, but I would prefer a meal I can eat with no fuss or bother.

getting your luggage intact is essential,Marc Vanden Berghe,Not Verified,"Arriving at Toronto for a tour of Canada, we had no luggage. Air Canada told us it was delayed.

The employees of the hotels we stayed in were unable to get anything from Air Canada. All way during our tour, we were told: ""alas, they are notorious for the fact"".

Air Canada accepted full liability,Gill Stafford,Not Verified,"I tried to give the documentation with instructions on disconnecting my son's electric wheelchair to the baggage handler in Halifax. He refused to take them saying he knew what to do. Air Canada insists on this documentation which should be fastened to the wheelchair by the baggage handler. When we arrived at Heathrow, special Needs staff lifted G into his wheelchair; he switched the power on but his chair was dead. We spent the four hours between our flight to Manchester with engineers, ground staff and special needs staff but no-one could fix the chair. The headrest appeared broken too. We were transferred to a different terminal in a manual chair. We spent a further two hours at Manchester where staff tried in vain to find the problem and complete paperwork confirming damage. Staff read the wheelchair manual but this was too technical for a layperson to understand.We borrowed a manual chair to take G home, his own broken chair being delivered home late the following evening. Air Canada have accepted full liability and will pay the nhs for repairs (it's an nhs wheelchair). The repair contractor found the baggage handler had disconnected every possible connection in the wheelchair rather than disconnecting one easily accessible plug for the flight duration as was in the written instructions he refused to read. The wheelchair had to be completely stripped down for the reconnections to be made. Air Canada say they will also compensate us as G had to sit in his emergency basic canvas seated manual wheelchair for two days. He cannot move around in it and as the back does not tilt it makes it difficult for him to eat and drink. With regard to the flight, the seats were comfy with plenty of legroom - and I have long legs! Staff were polite. Breakfast was a choice of pancake or omelette.

Air Canada customer review,Lalia Laud,Not Verified,"The cabin crew were disinterested and slow. They act and like they are doing a special favour for you by pouring you a drink or even getting you some napkins. Blankets and headsets weren't offered but sold to you. You either bring your own (which takes up space), buy theirs, or freeze without being able to hear the movie. Comfort levels will decrease and the flight attendants won't be able to help much. A flight attendant told me that they cannot help me lift my luggage into the high luggage compartment. Any person complaining about any slight discomfort with reason were rudely put on the spot (the lights were broken and couldn't be turned off for one of the passengers so the passenger had to ask about it or else he couldn't nap. The flight attendant only tried their minimum best to help by taping the lights and then left him alone. The taped lights continued to fall off but the flight attendants just ignored him and responded only if the passenger actively tried to complain again. The flight attendant just tossed my napkins down on the table and left without a reply. I found it quite rude and impolite. The seats were new but poorly designed. The buttons for the remote were built onto the armrest of the passengers. It looks simple and basic but it was terribly uncomfortable for the passengers. Thus, many times the service button was accidentally pressed causing the flight attendants to become annoyed at us even though it was an accident. The lights, service, or volume buttons would accidentally turn on whenever I try to rest my arms on the armrest. A suggestion may be to add a cover for the buttons so that these small inconveniences can be avoided in the future.

Air Canada customer review,F Vedrenne,Not Verified,"Using MEX T1 is not always pleasant as it is crowded and small. Check in agents were friendly, but when I asked if there were late upgrades available, they said that business class was full. This turned out to be false, as there were two seats available. Boarding started late, but was done in an organized way. Once on board we were greeted by some very friendly Montreal-based crew members. The two francophone flight attendants were very friendly in a not-fake way as opposed to the overcompensated service that can be found on some airlines, the anglophone flight attendant looked a bit surly and was not friendly, but she did her job fine and was polite. It is a bit of a shame that food is the typical American ""buy-on-board"" selection. The options available were similar to any café food (sandwiches and wraps) served on a napkin along with other unfortunate junky choices. All non-alcoholic drinks were free of charge. (TIP: It is worth it to pay $7 when booking online, this will allow you to choose a main dish and a snack from the menu at no extra cost. Bear in mind that these items will be more expensive on board and that you will need to be carrying a credit card). The airplane was in great conditions in spite of its age. In flight entertainment was the standard personal video, but choices were not very enticing. Arrival was done in a very organized manner, and crew made sure that passengers with tight connections left the plane first, which is very considerate.

Air Canada customer review,Peter Grevstad,Not Verified,"The only thing I can conclude after numerous flights with AC over the years is that in terms of their international economy they're no longer trying to make it pleasant. I had an okay seat, 31K, at a bulkhead, with no window unfortunately. There's a jump seat there for crew, but the staff member simply asked me if I knew how to open the door in the event of an emergency, then told me not to open the door if it were underwater, and then walked away to join her friends at the rear. The food choices were awful. There was no drink service until dinner, and that was rather late as we were waiting for connecting passengers who never showed up, and whose luggage had to be offloaded. I put on a sleeping mask I'd brought along, and put a blanket over my head, and slept for nearly the entire flight, as the catering was so basic. I could just as well have bought a $2.99 frozen pasta at a grocery and have had it heated, such was the dinner service. Also, the IFE, especially the map, still does not work in the economy cabins.

Air Canada customer review,Peter Grevstad,Not Verified,"What a difference a cabin makes. I flew back to YYZ from LHR on 20 August. I learned the flight was full, and as I was in economy in a seat with no window (31K) I asked if there were any other economy seats that had a window. I was only offered the middle of the middle section, which I declined. I then asked if my Aeroplan miles would be of any use, but was told there were people with higher status on the flight. It doesn't hurt to ask, and it certainly helps to ask nicely, and to be decently dressed. I had a brief chat with ground staff, who were not in AC uniforms. Moments later, one of the ground staff approached me with a huge smile on her face, and a boarding card in her hand. I was taken up front to executive first, seat 10D. I've flown this cabin before, and was really pleased about the upgrade. It didn't matter to me at all that I didn't have a window at my seat. Such a huge difference from economy. Crew really can't do enough for you in the premium cabin. There were bubbles for boarding, along with pretzels, due to an allergic pax near me. I went up to the galley after takeoff to enjoy a glass of decent (but not really good) champagne, and some hot nuts. I then returned to my seat for meal service. There was middling champagne, but excellent reds and whites served with lunch. I had a seafood appetizer which was good, but which was not presented very attractively. Then I had a main of mushroom and herb-crusted lamb with red currant jus. I had this on a flight a few years ago out of CPH, and it was as good as I remembered, cooked rare. The CSA worked my side of the cabin, and he was attentive and friendly. The meal was filling, and so I skipped the cheese, and had ice cream and a cognac, and settled in for a sleep on my way back to Toronto. There was a snack service before landing, but the sandwiches, though wrapped, were really stale. The interesting thing is that the IFE's map feature does work in Business Class, but doesn't in economy: why is that? A pleasure to ride up front, but a drastic difference from down the back with economy pax. Again, I'll suggest that AC can do a lot to make their economy experience better: after all, tickets are about 1400$C for this trip in high season.

Air Canada customer review,Mesha Chow,Not Verified,"A 14-hour plus direct flight from Sydney to Vancouver was quite pleasant initially. Had a few hours of napping, to which the first snack/meal service was provided. However, I was hungry a couple of hours later and I did what I have done with other full-service carriers - I asked the attendant for a snack. I was told ""No"" and looked at as if I had asked for the strangest request. At this point in time, I was desperate enough to fork out money for a snack, and apparently, they do not have that option either. If only, maybe, the staff had gone the extra mile to explain that there was a lack of snacks (as it was a full flight), that they do not have this service with Air Canada (they literally only offer 1 snack and 1 meal service, as per their website), or if she was nice enough to offer a beverage, I would not be writing this review. Our connecting flight from Vancouver to Montreal was delayed, so we missed it. The only saving grace, was that the next flight that we were put on was only a 2-hour wait, which isn't too bad. The next plane was full, so I was seated separately from my partner, and had my hand-luggage involuntarily checked-in upon boarding the aircraft, because there was not enough overhead compartment space. The Vancouver to Montreal flight, was by no means any more pleasant, as they do not serve complimentary food, but available for purchase.

Air Canada customer review,Cheryl Ashdown,Not Verified,"Our family's first experience with Air Canada was in June 2015 flying from Portland to Paris.

Air Canada customer review,T Eldem,Not Verified,"Slow check-in in Beijing. Used the Air China Business Lounge which is consistently disappointing. Flight was ready to leave the gate on time but ATC had grounded all flights due to pending thunderstorms. The captain did a stellar job keeping the passengers informed while we waited on the tarmac for 4 hours. The crew served water, juice and snacks during this time. Once airborne, the service was prompt and FA's generally friendly although a couple of them appeared to be annoyed and uninterested in their job. Dinner and breakfast were OK with reasonable number of meal and drink choices. The pods are at the end of their service life with cushions becoming inadequate for restful sleep. IFE content was mediocre and sound quality was poor.

Air Canada customer review,J Cowles,Not Verified,"Came off a flight from London and had booked an internal flight to get me to Edmonton. Turns out it would have been quicker to drive. We boarded on time but were then told that there was an electrical fault with one of the radios. We waited on the tarmac for an hour and then an engineer came and replaced the offending part. During this time, communication from the flight attendant was scant and when he did speak it was comical. Each time he read the announcements from his dog-eared handbook looking like he would rather be anywhere else in the world from here. We eventually took off and the flight to Edmonton was fine. On landing we were in the middle of a thunderstorm so there was no tractor available to tow us to the gate. We waited around 30 mins and then we were good to go. Coming back it was another story. I was booked on the 3pm flight back to Calgary to connect to AC850 at 17.50. I checked in and was happily waiting at the gate when my cousin called to tell me we were delayed (she was getting updates from an app on her phone). There was nothing to say we were delayed on any of the airport screens. Further updates came through to say the delay was being extended and then it finally came up at the gate, although no announcements were made. I had to watch the 4pm and 5pm flights depart on time and then finally the 3pm flight was cancelled and we were transferred to the 6pm flight. Obviously I had missed my connection by that point. Cabin staff on the return leg were rude and unhelpful when I tried to enquire how best to get to my next gate at Calgary. I understand that airlines are always prone to delays but the lack of communication really annoyed me. I'll definitely try to get a direct flight next time.

Flight from Toronto to Beijing had an orderly boarding process and was ready for departure however a last minute delay was encountered to remove luggage belonging to a passenger who did not show up. The aircraft interior looked in dire need of an overhaul with floor boards torn off at the pods, food splattered on the pod walls and side panels of the seat hanging loose. The service from the FA's was warm and conducted efficiently. Food was of reasonable quality and quantity and it was good to see an updated menu. There was a good selection of wines, spirits and soft drinks but there were no hot beverages available during the 13 hour flight due to a maintenance problem. I learned later in the flight that the very same aircraft had been suffering from this for the last three weeks. IFE was disappointing as the content had not been updated for the last four months and did not match what was advertised on their website and magazines.

Air Canada customer review,Sydnie Jimerson,Not Verified,"I was disappointed by my travel day with Air Canada from Vancouver to Toronto connecting in Toronto to Dublin. The first leg was delayed by an unknown amount because of maintenance issues. They bumped me and other passengers to a different plane so that we would make our connections (after delaying for about 1 hour and 45 minutes), which was appreciated but I ended up in a terrible seat and still cutting it extremely close and I have no idea when the original plane actually ended up taking off. We landed in Toronto and almost ran off the plane to try to make what I thought would be a very short connection of about 30 minutes in a huge airport. Turns out the next leg was also delayed, so far by 2 hours (I'm still sitting her, waiting to board and fuming) for, again, maintenance. Apparently this time they know what's wrong but they have to go get a part to replace something in one of the pilot/copilots chairs? At least that's what I gleaned from the flight attendants and various other passengers discussing the issue. I understand that delays happen sometimes. But its a little ridiculous for both of these planes to need last minute maintenance. We haven't been offered any kind of compensation for all of this trouble and I'm annoyed.

Air Canada customer review,Ahmed Emad ,Not Verified,"I was travelling from Edmonton, CA to Cairo, Egypt on Monday July 6th 2015 on flight AC 8153, with my 17 and 15 years old children and my 7 month old baby. We were supposed to catch flight AC 852 from Calgary to London, however, there was a 2.5 hour delay and accordingly there was a risk that we would miss our flight from London to Cairo. I went to the Air Canada customer service, who told us that if we missed our flight we would be compensated. However, on flight from Calgary to London I was disappointed once again, I asked the flight attendant for a can opener because I wanted to open my baby's formula but they said they didn't have one. It was very inconvenient considering that the flight was 9 hours long. They didn't give me extra food or any baby food (which was supposed to be provided since they knew there was going to be a baby on board). When we got to London at 2.57 pm, we, obviously with no surprise, missed our next flight that was planned to depart at 3pm. We were booked for the flight that leaves at 10.30 pm, thus making us stay at the airport for 7.5 hours! We were treated with no respect whatsoever.

Unfortunately before we left I broke my foot and was on crutches for the trip duration. We signed up for handicap assistance through Air Canada. They were our flight provider for every leg of our journey. I am so impressed with the service Air Canada provided. At every Check in, one or more Air Canada representatives were there with a wheelchair to transport me (with my 78 year young mom), to the next flight connection.

Air Canada customer review,T Eldem,Not Verified,"As a top tier AC frequent flyer I checked in using the priority lane. The agent was aloof. We had an onward connection with Lufthansa and despite providing her with booking reference and ticket numbers, she insisted there was nothing she could do to issue our boarding passes, so much for seamless integration with Star Alliance. On board, it was a very tired looking A330. The FA's bordered on rude and threw drinks and meal trays at the passengers. The food in both quality and quantity were on par with a budget airline. Seats were OK for economy and IFE had decent selection. AC lost its title as Best North American carrier and I hope this serves as a warning to them as their service and especially staff interactions have put them on par with the rest of the mainstream carriers in North America.

Business class has a spacious 1-2-1 layout in what AC calls private pods. Private they are for you very much feel isolated from the other passengers, which I appreciate. I love the 787 big windows. It makes you feel more connected to the exterior. I also loved the new IFE with a great touch-screen product. You can view your menu and all your wines on the screen. Food was superb - this time had an outstanding chicken tikka masala. The sparkling wine though, could be improved. It's too sweet for my liking. As is expected today, the seat converts to a fully-flat bed. When sleeping, perhaps the seat is still too high up for sometimes when turning around I would hit the front console with my hips.

Air Canada customer review,Brian Jones,Not Verified,"As a UK expat, I've done this route (YVR -LHR) dozens and dozens of times and have now taken the ridiculous step of flying via Calgary or Edmonton instead of taking the direct flight as the new ""High Capacity"" configuration on this route is outrageously bad. Even with Altitude status - so I can get a bullhead seat - the direct flight has appalling seat width and recline. Adding in extra economy rows so a few ""Premium Economy"" seats (is that a joke AC? ) can be jammed into this flying nightmare makes the matter worse. The 3-4-3 seats per row is a fine example of pure greed. Even the new business configuration is dire - what was wrong with the pods? I much prefer them to this arrangement.

For my flight from Calgary to Munich there was a promotion to check ski bags for free for flights to Europe.

Air Canada customer review,M Dietrch,Not Verified,"YYZ to ZRH on Boeing 787 in economy with my wife and infant. Check in staff in Toronto very helpful and the line moved quickly. Boarding and flight departure on time. I am 6'4"" and flying economy I was worried about leg room as I was unable to reserve a preferred seat. Air Canada Boeing 787 cabin was clean and felt open with the lighting and larger windows. I was surprised at the amount of leg room there was in an economy seat, as so many people have stated it was poor. My knees did touch the seat in front of myself however I was able to extend them under the seat with no problem. My wife being much shorter had plenty of room. I would suggest when travelling with an infant to take advantage of the bassinet seat as we did on the return flight. The seats are slightly narrow. The inflight entertainent was great having your own personal screen to watch numerous movies and TV shows. The only issue with these is that there is a ""remote"" control located on the arm rests. The buttons are usually pressed by the person sitting beside you which will cause your seat light and functions on the entertainment screen to be activated (sucks when watching a movies and volume keeps going up and down). The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful and service with a smile. Our first flight they even attempted to have people give up the bassinet seat to allow us to sit there. We had a great expirence flying with AC and will use them again in the future for sure.

Air Canada customer review,J Barendregt,Not Verified,"Last Friday I had a flight from Calgary to London Heathrow. My 9hr flight turned out as the worst flight I have had. After flying with British Airways for years now I decided to try Air Canada, but I won't again. The service and food were bad and a lot of screens and/or earphone plugs aren't working. As an single traveller, 6""4, it's not the most comfortable way of traveling. When I came on board and saw where I was seated this man asked me to change places with his wife so they could sit together. That is no problem for me, I'm pretty flexible so I helped them out. Now I sat in the middle block, had 2 seats next to me that were free. So giving up my seat wasn't a bad decision at all. I figured I could sleep well when I moved one seat up. 15mins in, the stewardess comes to me and asks me friendly if I could change seats with an older couple. I decided to give up my seat again for these people. The stewardess promised me that the seats there were as good as this one I was sitting in, except the one screen wasn't working where the man sat. We switched places and then I found out that my headphones were not working properly. Only my right earphone worked. Since the other screen wasn't working I was stuck. A little annoyed I got out of my seat again and walked up to the flight attendant who asked me to change seats. All she offered was the headphones they provide onboard, she said she would come to me in a minute. After almost an hour of waiting I had to go back to her. I ended up with some cheese and crackers, grapes and a cup of peanuts, one headphone working and a terrible feeling for letting me change my seat for other people. Besides all that the food was not good at all. From the dinner plate I got, I only ate the brownie.

Air Canada customer review,Chaoxian Tian,Not Verified,"Flew from Vancouver YVR to Sydney NS YQY via Montreal YUL and Halifax YHZ. First segment from YVR to YUL was an overnight flight on an A320. Received help from YVR ground crew since this was my first air travel in Canada. The flight took off and landed on time. Cabin crew on board was good at communication and drinks were served. However no meal was served for a 5-hr flight, which was to my surprise (and then I knew that AC simply does not do that on domestic flights no matter short-haul or long-haul). En-route entertainment system was a nice touch and there were programmes for different ages and culture. Seat was not an issue since I was seated in an exit row. Second segment from YUL to YHZ was on an E190, which was one of the most comfortable single-aisle aircraft in my opinion. Had entertainment system as well. Also, only drinks were served. This time I was seated in a normal row and the seat pitch was just enough to accomodate myself (6'2"" and 240lbs). Third segment was also a short one from YHZ to YQY, operated by Jazz on a 30 years old DeHavilland DHC8-100 (Dash8) turboprop. Cabin attendant was friendly and served drinks and snacks. Seat pitch was even tighter this time but since the seat cushion was shortened, there was still enough room to seat myself.

We flew Alaska Air there and returned on Air Canada flights. Big mistake! We booked last October and had confirmed reservations. From the moment we arrived at the airport, there were problems. First, their carry-on size is smaller than other airlines. OK. We repacked and paid for an extra checked bag. Then we proceeded to get our boarding passes only to find out we were on standby. No reasonable explanation offered. We proceeded to the gate where I stood ready to be first on line. The gate agent was patronizing and condescending, at best. He finally told me it was my fault since I did not select seats when I booked (the system said I could not select seats and would have to get them later.) I have travelled the world over for business - I am not a rookie at this. We waited and did get seats. Then they asked people to check their carry-on bags for free since the flight was full. We did it and were assured we were checked through to our final destination. Our first leg is completed - comfortable seats and good food options on board. Upon arrival in Toronto, we had to clear customs. We do all we are required to do, but we are not cleared to proceed because our bags have not been accounted for. We wait and are in fear of missing our next flight. Air Canada stamps our card so we can proceed. We run for the gate only to find the plane is not even there. We finally board and get to our final destination late. We wait for our bags and one is missing. No one from Air Canada is to be found and their phone system is very slow.

Air Canada customer review,F Vedrenne,Not Verified,"YUL-LHR-YYZ-MEX in Economy. It is always a pleasure to travel with such a professional airline. Cabin crew members are always really good. I did the YUL-LHR on May the 7th and I was on one of the newer Boeing 777-300ER with 3x4x3 abreast economy class. The cabin was new and spotless, seats were really comfortable and inflight entertainment was excellent. Service was really good, but the second meal was only a very bad slice of cake. LHR-YYZ was on an older 777-300ER with 3x3x3 abreast economy on May 26th. I could not perceive any difference in width between the inbound and the outbound flights. Most of the cabin crew on board this flight were the best AC bunch I have had in a while, there was one that was very nasty to a passenger whose English could not be understood easily. Finally, the YYZ-MEX leg on an Airbus 319 was a breeze as the cabin was almost empty. I had encountered the CSM working in this flight before, and I have to say he does know how to co-ordinate a team. Air Canada does not offer free meals in its flights to Mexico anymore, but I prefer them over the competition because they are a no-nonsense airline with hard-working.

Air Canada customer review,M Alexander,Not Verified,AC761 to San Francisco AC 760 to Montreal. May 26 - June 2. I flew from Montreal to San Francisco on May 26 The plane was clean and the staff were really friendly and experienced. The entertainment system had some good selections. Overall its was a great flight my only complaint is that this is a 6 hour flight yet they still make you pay for food which I find is not fair since I flew Montreal-London in December and its a shorter flight yet you still get a meal.,6th June 2015,,Economy Class,,,5,5,3,4,0,0,5,[],0,22.0,5,4.4,0.0,0.2657407407407408,"['san', 'francisco', 'ac', 'montreal', 'may', 'june', 'flew', 'montreal', 'san', 'francisco', 'may', 'plane', 'clean', 'staff', 'really', 'friendly', 'experienced', 'entertainment', 'system', 'good', 'selections', 'overall', 'great', 'complaint', 'hour', 'yet', 'still', 'make', 'pay', 'food', 'find', 'fair', 'since', 'flew', 'december', 'shorter', 'yet', 'still', 'meal']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Rob DiSaverio,Not Verified,My wife and I flew Ottawa to Vancouver return. All the planes were full. The positive was that the airline crew were friendly enough and worked well together on all flights. On the way there we flew threw Montreal and boarded an A330-300. A nice big plane with 2-4-2 which works well for couples. On the way back we flew direct on a smaller A320 with 3 and 3 seating. The back of the plane felt very warm and all the restrooms are at the back so there is always a constant flow of people. Air Canada does a good job of providing seat back screens to their fleet. Movie choices were acceptable but regular TV either wasn't available or the selection was poor. The food and beverage cart went by twice and water was offered more often. Nothing is free except the water and soft drinks. I should mention Air Canada has improved it's telephone waiting times considerably.,6th June 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,4,0,0,3,[],0,17.0,5,3.4,0.0,0.19237603305785125,"['wife', 'flew', 'return', 'planes', 'full', 'positive', 'airline', 'crew', 'friendly', 'enough', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'way', 'flew', 'threw', 'montreal', 'boarded', 'nice', 'big', 'plane', 'works', 'well', 'couples', 'way', 'back', 'flew', 'direct', 'smaller', 'seating', 'back', 'plane', 'felt', 'warm', 'restrooms', 'back', 'always', 'constant', 'flow', 'people', 'good', 'job', 'providing', 'seat', 'back', 'screens', 'fleet', 'movie', 'choices', 'acceptable', 'regular', 'tv', 'either', 'available', 'selection', 'poor', 'food', 'beverage', 'cart', 'twice', 'water', 'offered', 'often', 'nothing', 'free', 'except', 'water', 'soft', 'drinks', 'mention', 'improved', 'telephone', 'waiting', 'times', 'considerably']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,R Simon,Not Verified,ORD-YYZ on Apr 23 on an Embraer 175 operated by Jazz and YYZ-CPH on Apr 28 on a 787-800 Dreamliner after a stopover in Toronto both legs in Business Class. ORD-YYZ was on time FA's were friendly and fairly attentive a dinner (chicken skewers on warm salad) was served nothing special but fine for the short hop. Seats were comfortable for the short flight however not as good as the first class seats on US airlines. Check-in in ORD as well as in YYZ worked well manned premium counters and just a short wait. AC uses UA lounge in ORD which was poor as expected. Fairly crowded no actual food some limited snacks most alcoholic drinks were for purchase but some were complimentary such as house wine and one type of domestic beer. However the lounge has a manned bar which for practical purposes means as this is the US tips are expected anyway. Boarding was uneventful which is good. Arrival in Pearson a mess arriving passengers are held back midway in the terminal by airport employees while crossing embarking passengers make their way to their plane. This lasted for several minutes with frustrated arriving passengers with tight connections having to wait for the embarkation process to finish. Also airport employees were rather rude in this situation. Customs hall before border control packed and 45 minutes wait to get through border control. Arrival process in Person obviously not AC's fault but still very unpleasant; not a good first impression for Canada. Check-in and security at Person was a breeze. YYZ-CPH was boarded on time but then delayed for almost an hour at the gate and on the tarmac because one generator did not work. For this reason the plane was also unpleasantly hot while on the ground. Once in the air everything was fine. The Dreamliner is obviously a modern and comfortable plane. AC’s version has a 1-2-1 pod style configuration with lie flat seats. IFE was AVOD with a decent movie selection. Crew of friendly senior FA's were excellent professional courteous and attentive. Air Canada is obviously going for a European style of service rather than following the style of US based airlines. Also FA's were regularly present in the cabin to check if something is needed and generous with wine refills. Dinner was a seafood appetizer salad and roasted cod plus various dessert choices. I thought dinner service was very good for airline food. Also featuring some Canadian flavors as well as a Canadian Chardonnay. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Skipped breakfast in favor of sleeping an additional hour so cannot comment on its quality. AC's Maple Leaf Lounge again excellent comfortable spacious and with various quite good food options and a nice selection of drinks. A very pleasant experience and several quality steps above the lounges operated e.g. by UA or AA. Arrival in CPH was delayed 45 minutes but fine otherwise. Border Control in CPH fast and efficient and quite surprisingly for CPH no long wait for the luggage to arrive. All in all two very pleasant flights. Have not flown AC previously because of the airlines mixed reputation but wanted to make use of the stopover possibility in Toronto and to fly the Dreamliner. Will definitely include AC in my future travel plans after this experience.

Air Canada customer review,German Guzman,Not Verified,Last month flying from Montreal to Geneva. First the plane left with a delay of about 45 minutes after 2 hours in the air the airplane was detoured back to Montreal due to mechanical problem. Back in Montreal we encountered nothing but rude and useless staff. I had to pay for a cab and Air Canada only offered a voucher for 10 dollars. Next day the same aircraft was used to resume the trip. The returning flight Geneva-Montreal was also cancelled due to mechanical issues and it was the same aircraft. I lost it at the airport when the useless staff just give me a new flight for next day without even try to look for an alternative flight (several flights going to Paris for instance). I had to call customer service in Canada to change another flight also with Air Canada to South America. Long story short try another company and do not spend you money on this company.

Air Canada customer review,Michael Lipin,Not Verified,I was involuntarily bumped from a UA flight 3803 (an Air Canada code share) from Toronto Pearson to Washington Dulles on April 12th. I was in transit at Pearson en route from Tel Aviv to Dulles with an original layover of 2 hours 55 minutes. My initial flight AC 85 from Tel Aviv was late departing and arrived in Toronto at 5.50pm an hour and 15 minutes late. That still left me more than an hour-and-a-half to make it to flight UA 3803 scheduled to depart at 7.30pm. After disembarking from flight AC 85 and reaching Pearson's passport control an Air Canada attendant advised me to go through U.S. customs and proceed to my gate. I arrived at the gate on time at 7pm when boarding was under way. When my boarding pass was scanned a UA gate attendant said I could not board because the Dulles flight was oversold and I had been bumped from the flight some time earlier. No reason was given for the bump. The UA gate staff told me to speak to Air Canada about booking another flight back to Washington and I later had to cross the border into Canada and stay overnight at a hotel paid for by Air Canada. I boarded Air Canada flight AC 7354 to Washington DCA the next morning April 13th. After arriving at DCA I discovered to my dismay that the suitcase I had checked in at Tel Aviv was not on my flight.

On our trip home I asked for a black coffee. She said she was making more as several travelers had asked. I did not my coffee or anything else to drink.

Air Canada customer review,A Ngui,Not Verified,Flew YEG-YYZ-YEG April 22 and May 2 return. Was using their A320 with 3-3 abreast in Economy. Flight was 99% full and most travellers already paid and selected their seats. When my turn for the 24 hour seat selection check-in comes the reservation system selected what was left for me spouse and 2 children. With it being 3-3 we got the middle and aisle of either side in row 32 BCDE. This is the last row because the ones behind us were reserved for crew only. Its gets annoying as the 2 lavatories lineups extend past your row so you get a constant flow of people going in the almost 4 hour flight. Meals for purchase are fine for those that want it. The thing that ticked me off was only beverages were served complimentary. No snacks at all on this flight. There is one FA for business class cabin while two for the economy cabin. FAs are there to do their jobs and that is it. The boarding call in YEG was good where they actually boarded the Zone 3 properly by calling out pax with children board first and enough advance notice was given. In YYZ forget that. Zone 3 was not properly announced and it jumped from announcing Zone 1 hasty Zone 2 and a hurried Zone 3 general boarding with not enough time for parents with young children to board first announced. Its seems like a mess. I had to pay for my stroller since its not the umbrella type and their small dimensions. $25 each way. Really pathetic domestic service for AC as its a flag carrier and does not seem to be like one. Seating is the older one but legroom and seat pitch seems small already.

Air Canada customer review,K Andrews,Not Verified,Traveled YYT to MBJ for holiday. The YYT to YYZ leg was Air Canada main YYZ to MBJ was Rouge. After reading the many complaints about Rouge service I was on the lookout for problems but did not find any. Excellent service on both trips with a very attentive cabin crew. On the return leg from YYZ to YYT we were unable to land due to fog and had to return to YUL arriving at 2.30 am. Air Canada gate agents met us in the terminal with hotel and meal vouchers and informed us that a new flight for us would be departing at 9am and we received our luggage quickly. We opted to not got to the hotel as it would be a short stay so we checked back in and waited in the Maple Leaf Lounge. We reported for boarding at 8.30am but were informed that due to weather at YYT we would be delayed until 11.30am. Air Canada agents handed out meal vouchers and we returned to the lounge.

Air Canada customer review,S Lane,Not Verified,"AC1828 Kahului OGG to Vancouver YVR April 30th. This was one of the worst trips on Air Canada that I have experienced. Really how many people can they jam on a plane? The seats were so close together I had trouble and I am only 5ft two inches tall. I cannot imagine how taller people manage or bigger people for that matter as the seats are also very narrow. The seats barely reclined maybe and inch or so. This was a long flight 5.5 hours with no food offered. Drinks of just tea coffee water and some soft drinks offered only twice in the whole trip. Not sure what the attendants do in all this time. The reading lights for all the middle section of seats did not work. This was an international flight - US to Canada but I think Air Canada views it as one country. The flight crew had the nerve to say on leaving ""Hope you had a good flight"". Obviously they have never flown in economy on this flight.

Air Canada customer review,D Chiu,Not Verified,FRA to YYZ. Business class pods were wonderful. We fly these several times a year. The new Maple Leaf Lounge at FRA was beautiful! The food was fresh and plentiful power outlets were readily available spacious and the showers were excellent. The lounge is right on top of the departure gate resulting in a easy process to board the plane. Flew a 777. Pods were clean FA's were attentive and pleasant bathrooms were clean food was excellent for an airline and flight was uneventful (the way it should be). I am *A Gold.

Air Canada customer review,K Andrews,Not Verified,Traveled YYT to MBJ for holiday. The YYT to YYZ leg was Air Canada main YYZ to MBJ was Rouge. After reading the many complaints about Rouge service I was on the lookout for problems but did not find any. Excellent service on both trips with a very attentive cabin crew. On the return leg from YYZ to YYT we were unable to land due to fog and had to return to YUL arriving at 2.30 am. Air Canada gate agents met us in the terminal with hotel and meal vouchers and informed us that a new flight for us would be departing at 9am and we received our luggage quickly. We opted to not got to the hotel as it would be a short stay so we checked back in and waited in the Maple Leaf Lounge. We reported for boarding at 8.30am but were informed that due to weather at YYT we would be delayed until 11.30am. Air Canada agents handed out meal vouchers and we returned to the lounge. Flight departed at 11.30am and we arrived YYT without incident. Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely fly Air Canada again.

It was surprisingly quiet and smooth for a propeller plane as I sat as far away as possible from the engines at the very last row. Cabin crew acceptable but no food offered on this flight. Next leg: YYC-FRA on an Airbus 330 - cabin crew on this flight were atrocious. Food was literally thrown on passengers tray tables. Serving portions were very small. The food which was offered was disgusting - the tomato pasta dish was extremely unappetizing. And the ""continental breakfast"" was a small piece of cake and a yoghurt shake - it was hardly a snack let alone a breakfast. Cabin crew disappeared after the meal service not to be seen again until before landing in FRA. Final leg: YYZ to YYJ onboard an Airbus 320.

When I landed at YYZ I stopped at their counter for transferring passengers to reserve my seat but amazingly they said they couldn't do that just before the departing time. Just before my flight started boarding they changed my boarding pass and my seat was between aisle and window seats.

I returned from Tokyo Haneda (HND) via YYZ to DCA. Flight 1175 from YYZ to YVR was horrible - a 777 with 10-across cattle-car seating. Never again! Flight 3 from YVR to NRT was a great disappointment. Poor food (no taste and meagre portions) and a lacklustre cabin crew - lazy and not helpful. I had decided never to select Air Canada again (and was dreading the return flight) however Flight 6 from HND to YYZ (also a 777) had 9-across seating and a much better cabin crew.

Air Canada customer review,Marc Belanger,Not Verified,I flew out of Hong Kong to Toronto. I tried to book my seat online as offered by the Air Canada website 24 hours before my flight but the system would not allow me to do so. I was sick with the flu and requested to get an aisle seat 5 hours before my flight at Hong Kong airport. I was then told that the airplane was overbooked and that no aisle seats were available. I was told to go to the Air Canada counter to request one. To my great surprise their is no Air Canada counter in Hong Kong airport. I was then told to go to my gate and ask the personnel there which I did and they offered an end of the plane seat without a working TV. This was unacceptable for a 14 hour flight. I was then told to keep my mouth shut and keep the seat that was originally assigned to me.

Air Canada customer review,Kylie McNamara,Not Verified,After reading lots of negative reviews I was a bit nervous about flying with Air Canada! We have just returned from a 5 week holiday flying with Air Canada all the way through from Sydney-Vancouver-San Francisco-New York- Toronto-Tel Aviv and back again. We got quite a reasonable airfare and when I consider each of the flights we took over the duration of our stay I have to say that overall I have no real complaints. We had no delays to any of our flights no flight schedule changes no issues whatsoever. All of the staff including ground staff and flight attendants were pleasant and helpful and we had no negative interactions. Staff were lenient on a couple of occasions without baggage allowance and we never waited long at the check in counters. Long haul flights no matter which airline are generally arduous and uncomfortable but Air Canada was certainly not the worst airline we have ever flown. The food was a little hit and miss but then it is extraordinarily difficult to cater meals for everyone also we tended to always eat a proper sit down meal at the airport before boarding a long flight so we often just skipped the first meal anyhow. If Air Canada offers a similarly well priced fare for our next holiday we would definitely consider using them again.,28th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,3,0,0,4,[],0,19.0,5,3.8,0.0,-0.06216104497354497,"['reading', 'lots', 'negative', 'reviews', 'bit', 'nervous', 'flying', 'returned', 'week', 'holiday', 'flying', 'way', 'aviv', 'back', 'quite', 'reasonable', 'airfare', 'consider', 'took', 'duration', 'stay', 'overall', 'real', 'complaints', 'delays', 'schedule', 'changes', 'issues', 'whatsoever', 'staff', 'including', 'ground', 'staff', 'attendants', 'pleasant', 'helpful', 'negative', 'interactions', 'staff', 'lenient', 'couple', 'occasions', 'baggage', 'allowance', 'never', 'waited', 'long', 'check', 'counters', 'long', 'haul', 'matter', 'airline', 'generally', 'arduous', 'uncomfortable', 'certainly', 'worst', 'airline', 'ever', 'flown', 'food', 'little', 'hit', 'miss', 'extraordinarily', 'difficult', 'cater', 'meals', 'everyone', 'tended', 'always', 'eat', 'proper', 'sit', 'meal', 'airport', 'boarding', 'long', 'often', 'skipped', 'first', 'meal', 'anyhow', 'offers', 'similarly', 'well', 'priced', 'fare', 'holiday', 'definitely', 'consider', 'using']","['customer', 'review']",neg

Air Canada customer review,J Patry,Not Verified,Flew YDF-YYZ-PVG in Economy. Although I usually check-in online I did so at the airport since it is a small airport and I had luggage to check through to Shanghai. Staff were friendly and efficient. The first flight was an A319 from Deer Lake NL to Toronto which was comfortable and had a great selection on the AVOD. There was food for purchase and complimentary drinks. For the Toronto-Shanghai flight boarding was relatively efficient despite being a full flight. Take off was on time and the same AVOD was available. Seats although small were comfortable. Beverage service began 45 minutes after take off accompanied by a small bag of pretzels. Supper was served approximately 1.5 hours after take off which consisted of either a pork or chicken option. I had the chicken in cream sauce with roasted potato carrot and green bean. Also each tray had a corn and iceberg lettuce salad a white bun and brownie for dessert. It was quite decent for airline food and certainly not the worst I've had travelling. The wine selection was decent too. At the halfway point a Nissin cup of noodles were served with a chicken finger sandwich on white bread with a pack of biscuits. Finally there for breakfast there was a choice between congee or eggs and sausage. I elected for the mushroom and chicken congee which was quite good. It was accompanied by melon and a white bun with jam and butter.

Air Canada customer review,Silva Dirlandes,Not Verified,My wife and I just arrived this morning on AC flight AC99 from Rio de Janeiro Brazil to Toronto. The seats were very small and cramped but being in economy class we couldn't say much. The big Surprise came when the attendant brought our Kosher meal for both dinner and breakfast for us to open the seal. We were shocked with the portions. They were so small and only 4 tiny items for dinner and less for breakfast this morning. Even when Passover was over 3 weeks ago now we still got Passover meals for our dinner and breakfast. I called customer service today because our daughter is flying tomorrow with the same AC flight to see if something could be done in order to avoid old food for her and the answer was that whatever it is designed for her to eat it is already there for tomorrow night's dinner and they couldn't do anything.

Air Canada customer review,Robert Sandall,Not Verified,I flew from Victoria BC via Vancouver (AC 854) to London on 17th April 2015 at 18.40 hrs. The plane from Vancouver a Boeing 777-300 appeared new. The seating in economy was 10 abreast in the configuration 3-4-3. It was the worst flight I have experienced and I am a seasoned traveller. They have clearly added extra seats on these planes. I suspect the new Premium Economy cabin this plane has was added at the expense of space in Economy. It is unforgivable to subject economy class passengers to these new cramped conditions. Whilst people are getting bigger Air Canada sees fit to make the space provided smaller. On top of that the crew on my flight did and others have made the comment the bare minimum required and all without a smile! To treat passengers as if they are an inconvenience to their day is astonishing? The way the food is disgusting! A dollop of salad stale brownie and a dish of sludge which was masquerading as vegetarian Shepherds Pie! I also fly often to Toronto in planes with 2-5-2 configuration and that is more comfortable sadly the FAs and the good are still rubbish. If they change the configuration of those planes I will never fly Air Canada again.,22nd April 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,4,0,0,3,[],0,11.0,5,2.2,0.0,0.08718434343434346,"['flew', 'bc', 'via', 'ac', 'april', 'hrs', 'plane', 'boeing', 'appeared', 'new', 'seating', 'economy', 'abreast', 'configuration', 'worst', 'experienced', 'seasoned', 'traveller', 'clearly', 'added', 'extra', 'seats', 'planes', 'suspect', 'new', 'premium', 'economy', 'cabin', 'plane', 'added', 'expense', 'space', 'economy', 'unforgivable', 'subject', 'economy', 'class', 'passengers', 'new', 'cramped', 'conditions', 'whilst', 'people', 'getting', 'bigger', 'sees', 'fit', 'make', 'space', 'provided', 'smaller', 'top', 'crew', 'others', 'comment', 'bare', 'minimum', 'required', 'smile', 'treat', 'passengers', 'inconvenience', 'day', 'astonishing', 'way', 'food', 'disgusting', 'dollop', 'salad', 'stale', 'brownie', 'dish', 'sludge', 'masquerading', 'vegetarian', 'shepherds', 'pie', 'fly', 'often', 'planes', 'configuration', 'comfortable', 'sadly', 'fas', 'good', 'still', 'rubbish', 'change', 'configuration', 'planes', 'never', 'fly']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,T Eldem,Not Verified,YUL-YVR-YUL both legs on a tired looking A330-300. I checked in online and had carry-on luggage only so did not have any interaction with the check-in staff. Used the Maple Leaf Lounge on the domestic side in Montreal which is in dire need of a facelift and expansion as it tends to get very crowded at peak hours. Boarding was smooth and both flights left the gate and arrived on time. The pods are showing their age with worn-out and scuffed sections. Cabin lighting was dim and did not facilitate an airy environment. On-board service was typical AC style with FA's doing the absolute minimum required of them. Food and beverage choices were OK but it is time for an upgraded menu as they have had the same choices on transcontinental flights in Business Class for the past 4 years. IFE had a reasonable selection of movies but the sound quality was not the best even with my own noise- cancelling headphones. Washrooms like the aircraft itself looked old and run-down leaving the passengers with the impression that they were dirty. Air Canada prides itself in being voted the best North American Airline for several years in a row which I believe is giving them a totally false sense of accomplishment by comparing them to US carriers which are widely acknowledged as being inferior to Middle Eastern and Asian carriers. Although AC has made some progress in recent years uplifting its image and improving its service its progress has now stalled which if left unattended will push them back into the same mediocrity as the US carriers. It is time for them to start setting the bar higher and striving for a higher standard of service by looking to full-service Asian and Middle Eastern carriers as examples to follow.,19th April 2015,,Business Class,,,2,2,2,2,0,0,2,[],0,10.0,5,2.0,0.0,0.0880952380952381,"['legs', 'tired', 'looking', 'checked', 'online', 'luggage', 'interaction', 'staff', 'used', 'maple', 'leaf', 'lounge', 'domestic', 'side', 'montreal', 'dire', 'need', 'facelift', 'expansion', 'tends', 'crowded', 'peak', 'hours', 'boarding', 'smooth', 'left', 'gate', 'arrived', 'time', 'pods', 'showing', 'age', 'scuffed', 'sections', 'cabin', 'lighting', 'dim', 'facilitate', 'airy', 'environment', 'service', 'typical', 'ac', 'style', 'fa', 'absolute', 'minimum', 'required', 'food', 'beverage', 'choices', 'ok', 'time', 'upgraded', 'menu', 'choices', 'transcontinental', 'business', 'class', 'past', 'years', 'ife', 'reasonable', 'selection', 'movies', 'sound', 'quality', 'best', 'cancelling', 'headphones', 'washrooms', 'like', 'aircraft', 'looked', 'old', 'leaving', 'passengers', 'impression', 'dirty', 'prides', 'voted', 'best', 'north', 'american', 'airline', 'several', 'years', 'row', 'believe', 'giving', 'totally', 'false', 'sense', 'accomplishment', 'comparing', 'carriers', 'widely', 'acknowledged', 'inferior', 'middle', 'eastern', 'asian', 'carriers', 'although', 'ac', 'progress', 'recent', 'years', 'uplifting', 'image', 'improving', 'service', 'progress', 'stalled', 'left', 'unattended', 'push', 'back', 'mediocrity', 'carriers', 'time', 'start', 'setting', 'bar', 'higher', 'striving', 'higher', 'standard', 'service', 'looking', 'asian', 'middle', 'eastern', 'carriers', 'examples', 'follow']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,C Davis,Not Verified,I live in Cleveland and fly to Paris twice a year. I fly Air Canada through Toronto. Yesterday my flight from Paris was delayed by an hour making my chance of making connecting flight to Cleveland very slim. I went to the Air Canada desk to try and get a seat on a later flight and the customer service agent helped me make the earlier flight by walking me to the front of the customs line the (to me unnecessary) security line and then the immigration line.

Air Canada customer review,Claudio Rallo,Not Verified,I flew AMS-LHR-YOW on April 2nd and return on April 12th. Both were BA/AC interline flights. The BA flights and the transits at London Heathrow from T5 to T2 and vice versa proceeded very smoothly. Now my comments on my experience with Air Canada on this trip: Air Canada uses the Boeing 767-300ER between YOW and LHR. Despite this plane showing its age it's always a very sturdy and reliable plane no wonder that many airlines are still using them regularly on long haul routes. On my outbound flight the captain gave accurate cockpit announcements and staff members on both flights were very attentive and professional. Food snacks and refreshments were plentifully provided throughout the flights. My only issue is with the seats which were uncomfortable and there was very little legroom. Otherwise the meals were decent by airplane food standards and Air Canada offers a great inflight entertainment service keeping you busy on a 7-hour flight. I travel to Canada at least a couple of times a year and previously I used KLM travelling to Ottawa with a stopover at YUL. The route I took with Air Canada this time works out better for me personally and overall I am quite well satisfied with this airline. Will use them again in the future.,19th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,4,3,5,0,0,4,[],0,18.0,5,3.6,0.0,0.14301136363636366,"['flew', 'april', 'return', 'april', 'interline', 'ba', 'transits', 'heathrow', 'vice', 'versa', 'proceeded', 'smoothly', 'comments', 'experience', 'trip', 'uses', 'boeing', 'yow', 'lhr', 'despite', 'plane', 'showing', 'age', 'always', 'sturdy', 'reliable', 'plane', 'wonder', 'many', 'airlines', 'still', 'using', 'regularly', 'long', 'haul', 'routes', 'outbound', 'captain', 'gave', 'accurate', 'cockpit', 'announcements', 'staff', 'members', 'attentive', 'professional', 'food', 'snacks', 'refreshments', 'plentifully', 'provided', 'throughout', 'issue', 'seats', 'uncomfortable', 'little', 'legroom', 'otherwise', 'meals', 'decent', 'airplane', 'food', 'standards', 'offers', 'great', 'inflight', 'entertainment', 'service', 'keeping', 'busy', 'travel', 'least', 'couple', 'times', 'year', 'previously', 'used', 'klm', 'travelling', 'stopover', 'yul', 'route', 'took', 'time', 'works', 'better', 'personally', 'overall', 'quite', 'well', 'satisfied', 'airline', 'use', 'future']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,German Gardeazabal,Not Verified,I have to say that Air Canada is the only Continental North American airline offering Premium Economy for some long haul flights and is very competitive with some Asian airlines that offer this cabin and I have to thank to AC for this. Despite the amazing good service and private cabin the comfort is something that is not quite the best. The front seat row 12 on the Dreamliner 787-8 is missing the leg support and relax as all other Asia/Pacific airlines such CX NH JL QF BR which has superior seat comfort and welcoming Champagne as well not only water and juice as AC offers. The food is very good and the drinks are well served 10 min once we are airborne. Flight Crew is very friendly and keep someone at the 'food bar' ready to help you with a drink or snack such as cookies during the entire flight. My flights were YVR-PEK on March 24 returning on Apr 2.

Air Canada customer review,Holly Byerly,Not Verified,"Flew from Sydney Australia to Vancouver on Air Canada and was truly a miserable experience. I'm a petite person and was miserably cramped in a small seat the food was disgusting and the most of the staff acted like those of us in economy class were an imposition. Two women who chatted loudly for 12 of the 14-hour predominately evening flight were not asked to lower their voices so that others could sleep the in-service entertainment a small screen inserted in the back of the seat ahead of us was dark and virtually impossible to see and although staff did pick up trash after meals they didn't after serving various beverages so we were left sitting in rubbish for the duration of the flight. Complaining seemed pointless in light of the persevering misery of the overall experience; I and most of my fellow passengers just took it all in stride.

Air Canada customer review,D Hu,Not Verified,AC63 - YVR to ICN. Flight was delayed because of malfunctioning A/C. Plane had left the gate and had to return. The total delay was over 2 hrs because of strong headwinds. The plane was immaculate as it was one of Air Canada's new B787-800s. The service was good but there was no 2nd option for meals on that flight-we were all served the same meal. Air Canada's new inflight entertainment system is incredibly responsive and has a great user interface. It is by far the best system I've experienced on a plane. It kept me occupied for the entire flight. The armrest controls on the other hand could have used some additional thought as it was placed on the surface of the armrest rather than the side and resulted in frequent accidental presses.

Air Canada customer review,O Rubenstein,Not Verified,YUL-YYZ-HKG-YYZ-YUL A320/B777. Typical of AC flights were late or delayed despite the weather being ok. Outbound YYZ-HKG flight had obnoxious disappearing FAs combined with a malfunctioning IFE. F&B was nothing special but edible. An average flight. Return HKG-YYZ-YUL flights were distinguished by the worst departure and arrival delays of all the flights and terrible catering. The J class main meal of beef was overcooked and inedible as it was so tough. Breakfast highlight was dried out croissants and a glop of salty greasy noodles. FAs on this segment were professional efficient and polite. AC's IFE featuring small screens with poor resolution has a limited library of interesting titles. It remained closed for most of my flights unlike my flights on CX or BR which offer current films along with an interesting selection of Asian films. AC's international films have a lot of Bollywood and are of little interest to China/Japan route customers. I really look forward to the Asian film selection on AC's higher end competitor EVA. The AC IFE equipment is at least 5 years out of date along with the uncomfortable worn out pods. The equipment was somewhat cleaner than usual although AC still refuses to provide headrest covers like the Asian airlines do. Not the most hygienic approach to air travel. The new blankets are a welcome change. The lavs were the usual basic AC setup so very different than those found on Asian carriers. Boarding procedures have drastically improved with the implementation of zones although many pax still do not understand the cabin baggage size and weight limits. AC has an inconsistent approach to this issue and I could see that some economy cabin pax were going to be made uncomfortable by a few selfish people. Desk agents on all segments were polite and pleasant to deal with. Baggage delivery at Canadian airports was slow as usual. Considering the fare paid which was higher than the AC competitors I don't think I received good value for my purchase.

Overhead bins too tiny for carry-on resulting in bags being shoved under seats wherever possible by an overwhelmed and stressed attendant. Disgraceful considering the usurious fare charged by AC.

Air Canada customer review,S Gurjal,Not Verified,My husband and I flew to Vancouver on Air Canada from Newark on March 11 2015. We were to take off at 6.30pm and reach Vancouver by 9.53pm At 5.45pm there was an announcement asking for eight volunteers to get off loaded. We started boarding at 6.20. At 7.00pm there was an announcement that an off loaded passenger's baggage couldn't be located. At 8.00 they located it. The pilot then said he would need to refuel! Finally it was 8.30pm when we were finally on our way. We reached Vancouver by 11.30. Our return on Monday March 16th was equally terrible. Our flight was scheduled to leave Vancouver at 9.10am and reach Montreal by 4.54pm. Our connection to Newark was to take off at 6.10. The flight didn't take off till almost 11am. In fact we had left the gate when the pilot announced a weight balance problem and brought the plane back to the gate to refuel. At 12.30pm when service was finally rendered there were no lunch items - only breakfast items to be purchased. When we landed in Montreal it was past 5.15pm. Even though we had informed the crew that we had to make an international connection we got no assistance. Our seats were at the back and it took 10 minutes to get out. There was no ground crew to assist us. We had expected a cart that would take us from the domestic to the international terminal for a quick transfer. On foot it was a very long walk. After quickly completing immigration and customs we reached the gate by 6.04. The gate had just closed - ironic that the only Air Canada flight our entire trip that took off on time was that one! They put us on an Air Canada flight to LaGuardia adding three hours of ground transportation to our already exhausting day. That flight left half an hour late reaching around 9.00pm. We had to buy tickets for ground transportation to take us from LGA to Newark since our car was at Newark airport's long term parking. We reached the car park by midnight and finally arriving home early next morning! There was no apology from Air Canada even though it was the airline's fault. Further there was no attempt by the airline in any tangible way to make the bad experience a little more bearable.,3rd April 2015,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,3,0,0,1,[],0,8.0,5,1.6,0.0,-0.057890625,"['husband', 'flew', 'march', 'take', 'reach', 'announcement', 'asking', 'eight', 'volunteers', 'loaded', 'started', 'boarding', 'announcement', 'loaded', 'passenger', 'baggage', 'located', 'located', 'pilot', 'need', 'refuel', 'finally', 'finally', 'way', 'reached', 'return', 'monday', 'march', 'equally', 'terrible', 'scheduled', 'leave', 'reach', 'montreal', 'connection', 'take', 'take', 'till', 'almost', 'fact', 'left', 'gate', 'pilot', 'announced', 'weight', 'balance', 'problem', 'brought', 'plane', 'back', 'gate', 'refuel', 'service', 'finally', 'rendered', 'lunch', 'items', 'breakfast', 'items', 'purchased', 'landed', 'montreal', 'past', 'though', 'informed', 'crew', 'make', 'international', 'connection', 'assistance', 'seats', 'back', 'took', 'minutes', 'ground', 'crew', 'assist', 'expected', 'cart', 'take', 'domestic', 'international', 'terminal', 'quick', 'transfer', 'foot', 'long', 'walk', 'quickly', 'completing', 'immigration', 'customs', 'reached', 'gate', 'gate', 'closed', 'ironic', 'entire', 'trip', 'took', 'time', 'put', 'laguardia', 'adding', 'three', 'hours', 'ground', 'transportation', 'already', 'exhausting', 'day', 'left', 'half', 'hour', 'late', 'reaching', 'around', 'buy', 'tickets', 'ground', 'transportation', 'take', 'lga', 'since', 'car', 'airport', 'long', 'term', 'parking', 'reached', 'car', 'park', 'midnight', 'finally', 'arriving', 'home', 'early', 'morning', 'apology', 'though', 'airline', 'fault', 'attempt', 'airline', 'tangible', 'way', 'make', 'bad', 'experience', 'little', 'bearable']","['customer', 'review']",neg

Air Canada customer review,T Mark,Not Verified,Just flew AC6 and AC5 and I have to say that AC are the worst airline I have been on. The flight attendants are awful they never smile do not show any interest in their work and never use the words please and thank you and overall as a passenger I was made to feel like a burden to them. The plane was dirty upon boarding AC5 many of the seats were still reclined meaning that safety protocol for landing had not been adhered to. The in-flight route map lasts 20 minutes then crashes the food is awful and the speed of service appalling. The trash from dinner was sat on my tray table for 55 minutes as the flight attendants were all eating and chatting in the gallery. As a regular NH flyer I feel the code-share between AC and NH reflects badly on NH who are outstanding.

Air Canada customer review,N Gagne,Not Verified,Just finished my flight from EZE to YQB with Air Canada's two cabin 777. It was a wonderful flight. After the stop in Santiago the fresh crew took care of all details. Although SCL is not the best kitchen in AC's network the food was good. The service was efficient but not rushed. It allowed for the cabin to go in sleep mode fairly early on in the flight. I don't understand AC's decision to move away from the two class config pods. They are comfortable and for me 6'1 a welcome lie flat experience. Slept very well and woke up just in time for breakfast. Hats off for this 5 star crew!

Air Canada customer review,C Kim,Not Verified,Just flew from Seoul to Vancouver and then onwards to Los Angeles less than 24 hours ago. Flight was fine except that I'm not too sure if the four star rating is justified - I'd say its more like 3.5. Tried the 787 for the first time and I have to say that the lighting system is brilliant as it eases the level of brightness on the eyes whenever the light is turned on by going from dark to bright gradually. Another added bonus to flying with Air Canada is that it makes US entry easy since customs and immigration is cleared in Canada thus not having to deal with the debacle that is met at US airports. As for the in flight experience the food wasn't half bad but the seating and entertainment can see some improvements. The seats were not ergonomically designed and no matter what position I would turn my body I just couldn't manage to sleep due to the discomfort and entertainment although extensive did not have a decent selection of films to choose from.,23rd March 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,4,0,0,3,[],0,18.0,5,3.6,0.0,0.20989583333333334,"['flew', 'onwards', 'los', 'angeles', 'less', 'hours', 'ago', 'fine', 'except', 'sure', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'justified', 'like', 'tried', 'first', 'time', 'lighting', 'system', 'brilliant', 'eases', 'level', 'brightness', 'eyes', 'whenever', 'light', 'turned', 'going', 'dark', 'bright', 'gradually', 'another', 'added', 'bonus', 'flying', 'makes', 'entry', 'easy', 'since', 'customs', 'immigration', 'cleared', 'thus', 'deal', 'debacle', 'met', 'airports', 'experience', 'food', 'half', 'bad', 'seating', 'entertainment', 'see', 'improvements', 'seats', 'ergonomically', 'designed', 'matter', 'position', 'turn', 'body', 'manage', 'sleep', 'due', 'discomfort', 'entertainment', 'although', 'extensive', 'decent', 'selection', 'films', 'choose']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Decent pitch for a guy who is 6""4 such as myself. The better of the two AVOD systems in Canada for sure. Only gripe was an extended period of ""turbulence"" where there was no communication many passengers stood up to use the facilities as did I. About 3-4 hours into the flight. The senior flight attendant rudely remarked ""you know the seatbelt sign is on!"" Not exactly highly service oriented. But still worth the trip from Calgary.

Air Canada customer review,F Atkin,Not Verified,Last Sunday travelling as a legit full fare paying J class pax from LAX-YYZ-YWG. AC792 arrives late from LAX into YYZ but still there is an hour to connect to AC271 YYZ-YWG. Canada Customs press a magic button which allow my 2 checked bags to go directly to my connecting flight when I announce I am returning from a vacation in Hawaii. I proceed to my domestic gate to board AC271 and while in line am redirected by the gate agent to see her colleague at the gate desk. I am told I have been taken off the flight as my 2 checked bags won't make the flight? I am offered a Y class seat on the last flight of the night with a suggestion by the gate agent that the stars may align and I may get to ride in the cabin I paid for. Sent unceremoniously to the Maple Leaf lounge to await my fate I am granted access to the exclusive club even though I have now been stripped of my upper class status. Within an hour I am presented with a J class boarding pass for the last flight of the night to YWG. Was I bamboozled by my favourite mother country flag carrier giving away my original highly prized seat 1A on a Jungle jet back to Winnipeg on AC271? My 2 checked bags went through YYZ without me even seeing them and they were secured for travel from LAX-YYZ-YWG on company aircraft yet I was denied boarding AC271 based on the fact that my bags would not make the flight? Was I being punished for flying Delta from HNL-LAX in order to avoid flying Rouge? Or was my seat given away prematurely to a company commuter?

Air Canada customer review,John Pillsbury,Not Verified,On Friday Feb 13 2015 my wife and I were to leave Boston for Toronto enroute to Tokyo to see family. Our plane was 45 minutes late arriving in Boston but were we reassured that making our connecting flights would not be an issue.

When we got to Toronto Pearson airport-which is the most unfriendly and confusing airport we have ever had the misfortune to be in-we got to our gate the plane was still there with the bridge still at the plane but we were told the gate was closed.

We were rudely informed that that was not possible and were directed to go to customer service.

Air Canada customer review,D Epstein,Not Verified,ORD-YUL-CDG in economy on 25/26th Jan 15. Our first flight with Air Canada was a shuttle from Chicago to Montreal where our flight to Paris CDG was our next leg. In fact due to late arrival we missed our connection and had to stay 24 hours in Montreal. Everything was handled perfectly by AC staff who gave us vouchers for a 4* hotel nearby and for meals. We could get our checked luggage back and were immediately handed our boarding pass for the following day. All being very smooth in a quiet airport. The following day our 6 hours flight to Paris by itself was OK with various standards. Aircraft (777-300) with a clean cabin without decoration the blue colour of seats being the only colour. The seats were standard without footrests. A good VOD system with recent movies especially for French speaking passengers. This is for the good side but when you see the fancy earphones handed over you will regret not to have yours with you. The weak side starts with no newspapers or magazines available. Cabin crew obviously well trained and working efficiently. I am sorry that uniforms are so plain. No efforts from attendants to look like attendants and participate to the dream of flying like many other airlines. Meals were frankly just edible. A small salad where I am still looking for dressing chicken with bulgur (totally bland) and a so-called chocolate cake retaining from chocolate only the colour! A standard rate for the table wine offered graciously and for the rolls quite correct for an airline. A bad rate for the low quality plastic cutlery. It seems North American carriers do like plastic very much. Before landing we had a slice of cake (good) with hot drinks served in a tumbler. All in all we were expecting more from an Airline claiming to be for the 5th time the best airline in North America.

Air Canada customer review,Williams Temidayo,Not Verified,Air Canada is by far the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly with. I was forced to sit through a 8 hour flight from London to Toronto with no TV entertainment because their screen was faulty while other passengers around me had their TVs working. The staff on board thought offering me newspapers was a good alternative to not having TV entertainment which we all pay for as part of ticket costs! Its like asking me to eat carrots for 8 hours rather than giving me the solid meal I was told I would receive as part of the service.

Air Canada customer review,Ian M Fraser,Not Verified,Planned to travel with Air Canada (Toronto to Ixtapa) on January 31st for a one week vacation in Mexico (given the short duration time was of the essence). Arrived at Pearson in good time and was advised the flight would be delayed 15 minutes (acceptable but just!). On arrival at departure gate loading of plane was initiated then minutes later an announcement that the loaded passengers would have to be deplaned as there as a maintenance issue (not a weather or staffing concern!). First observation: why does Air Canada insist on placing faulty equipment in the loading gate? Don't think it is too much to ask to have a functional plane ready and available to load at prescribed time! Worse the 'delay' (over the next six hours) lead to a flight cancellation at about 7pm. Many families with small children are then expected to deal with the development one that was obviously known hours earlier but not shared. Air Canada's behaviour in this regard is consistent - it would be only a common courtesy to advise on such matters - honestly and in a timely fashion - so passengers can make other arrangements. But no the airline drags the waiting times out until no other options are available. As a result a plane-load of angry passengers are at the 'customer service' desk to make alternate (hotel and air travel) arrangements only to learn that the staff there have not been advised of the situation. As a result more time is lost (almost an hour) as harried staff scramble to address the issue making other arrangements etc. without being prepared in advance for the onslaught with answers ready and alternate course of action determined! Again incredibly poor planning from this passengers perspective. Finally we were advised that we were scheduled on a flight the next morning and this one actually took off as scheduled and on time. Remarkably as for this passenger it was the first Air Canada flight (out of the most recent five flights flown with the airline) that was neither 'cancelled' or 'delayed' on departure (I reference flights between March 2014 and January 2015 in this regard: Denver SFO Nashville Miami and Ixtapa (1)). As a result my 'trust' in Air Canada is at an all-time low as they simply cannot be relied upon to reliably meet their contractual obligations. Worse no one seems to care about the stress and inconvenience caused by their unreliability. Wherever possible I would strongly suggest finding other airlines to utilize if and when possible.,18th February 2015,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,4,0,0,2,[],0,13.0,5,2.6,0.0,0.08601851851851851,"['planned', 'travel', 'ixtapa', 'january', 'week', 'vacation', 'mexico', 'given', 'short', 'duration', 'time', 'essence', 'arrived', 'pearson', 'good', 'time', 'advised', 'delayed', 'minutes', 'acceptable', 'arrival', 'departure', 'gate', 'loading', 'plane', 'initiated', 'minutes', 'later', 'announcement', 'loaded', 'passengers', 'deplaned', 'maintenance', 'issue', 'weather', 'staffing', 'concern', 'first', 'observation', 'insist', 'placing', 'faulty', 'equipment', 'loading', 'gate', 'think', 'much', 'ask', 'functional', 'plane', 'ready', 'available', 'load', 'prescribed', 'time', 'worse', 'six', 'hours', 'lead', 'cancellation', 'many', 'families', 'small', 'children', 'expected', 'deal', 'development', 'obviously', 'known', 'hours', 'earlier', 'shared', 'behaviour', 'regard', 'consistent', 'common', 'courtesy', 'advise', 'matters', 'honestly', 'timely', 'fashion', 'passengers', 'make', 'arrangements', 'airline', 'drags', 'waiting', 'times', 'options', 'available', 'result', 'angry', 'passengers', 'service', 'desk', 'make', 'alternate', 'hotel', 'travel', 'arrangements', 'learn', 'staff', 'advised', 'situation', 'result', 'time', 'lost', 'almost', 'hour', 'harried', 'staff', 'scramble', 'address', 'issue', 'making', 'arrangements', 'etc', 'prepared', 'advance', 'onslaught', 'answers', 'ready', 'alternate', 'course', 'action', 'determined', 'incredibly', 'poor', 'planning', 'passengers', 'perspective', 'finally', 'advised', 'scheduled', 'morning', 'actually', 'took', 'scheduled', 'time', 'remarkably', 'passenger', 'first', 'recent', 'five', 'flown', 'airline', 'neither', 'departure', 'reference', 'march', 'january', 'regard', 'sfo', 'ixtapa', 'result', 'low', 'simply', 'relied', 'upon', 'reliably', 'meet', 'contractual', 'obligations', 'worse', 'seems', 'care', 'stress', 'inconvenience', 'caused', 'unreliability', 'wherever', 'possible', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'finding', 'airlines', 'utilize', 'possible']","['customer', 'review']",pos

I switched over from WestJet after I had a bad experience of multiple late and delayed flights and I could not be happier! Flying with Air Canada in Canada is much better then flying with WestJet (from my own personal experience). I enjoy flying on the smaller ERJ 190s compared to a 737 on this route; less cramped and not as many people on board. I find that domestic check in with Air Canada moves quite smoothly with no real issues or problems. I have also noticed that Air Canada's prices are sometimes cheaper then WestJet (surprising I know).

The flight attendant said she'll see what can be brought from Business class leftovers. They even failed at that so they brought me the side items of the meal (without the entree) which was awful. This was way too inferior to another European airline which I flew with last month. If that wasn't enough they ran out of water half way and at least one toilet got clogged.

Air Canada customer review,W Jacob,Not Verified,Living in Canada one must either fly with Air Canada or West Jet domestically and have to use one of them for the first part of any international flight. Air Canada never fails to disappoint with their service it is dismal to say the least. They charge for everything from earphones to food on domestic flights. Food on international flights is also poor. I recently had breakfast on Thai Airways Singapore Airways and Air Canada. The meal was almost identical in all three instances but the portion size and taste was significantly better on Thai and Singapore. The dinner meals on Air Canada were also less than impressive compared to the Thai and Singapore. On more than 1 occasion my personal TV didn't work properly and flights nearly always depart late. I have flown nearly all types of Air Canada aircraft (787 777 767 A321 (A320) A330) and while their larger aircraft are comfortable their older smaller aircraft are uncomfortable.

Air Canada customer review,Ahmad Nadim,Not Verified,In July last year my wife and I travelled from Manchester UK to Toronto. Queuing for check in: I am a wheelchair user. I don't demand it but most airlines let wheelchair users join a fast queue for Check in. I don't demand it but have to say that it is a polite gesture this polite gesture was missing with Air Canada. Check in: was chaotic with long queues and check in staff seemed all over the place. It took us almost 1.5 hrs to reach the check in counter only to see that half the check in counters were not even open. Boarding: As we arrived at the boarding gate and were showed boarding passes we realised that me and my wife had been allocated seats a few rows apart. To the credit of airline staff they quickly sorted this out and put us in premium economy. Although they told us that we will have to pay for the entertainment and food but once we were on board they did not charge us. Arrival in Toronto: Because I need assistance to get on and off the plane I have to wait until everyone has gone. Usually it takes 5 to 10 minutes but this time it took over 45 minutes for assistance to arrive because no one knew that a passenger needed assistance to disembark the plane. Please note that I had requested the check in staff in Manchester twice to make sure that people know in Toronto that I will need assistance. Luggage collection: Upset and frustrated we arrived in the lounge to collect our suitcase. Everyone from our flight had collected luggage and gone. No carousel information was available. First we tried to look for our suitcase and then I found Air Canada customer service counter and queued to ask which carousel our suitcase would have arrived at. All of this took another hour and half almost but still no staff was available to help. Eventually we found our suitcase near one carousel.

Air Canada customer review,P Yu,Not Verified,Flew from Calgary to Narita before Christmas 2014 on a 767 economy. Food was horrible! Came back on a 787 to Vancouver.

Slight elbow movement may trigger the entertainment screen to shut off or the overhead light to turn on or off.

Air Canada customer review,G Patton,Not Verified,Yesterday I flew from London to Toronto on a Boeing 767 which is basically a lovely plane. My complaints about this flight which apply to every Air Canada flight I've taken in the past few years are principally about: a) terribly uncomfortable seats and b) the lousiest food anywhere in the air. a) Seat comfort. Who on earth designs a seat that is so short that it puts unbearable pressure on the middle of the back of one's thighs? And this wasn't a Rouge flight either but a mainline experience. Why do they torture us with seats that are so close together that our knees are grinding against the seat in front? I'm a very average sized person - 5'10 and 170 pounds - so there is no excuse why the seat should not be comfortable. And let's not even mention the fact that the available tilt is about 4 inches from front to back with zero lumbar support. b) Long ago back in the 70's when I was a university student I used to wonder why the cafeteria food was so terrible when Air Canada could server a very decent meal at 35000 feet in a pressurized aluminium tube. In those days I routinely asked if they had any leftover meals on transatlantic flights because the food was actually quite enjoyable. Not any more. It's just awful. Virtually inedible except when one is starving. And yesterday's flight was the very worst. Recently I had the opportunity to fly to from and around Central America on the Colombian airline Avianca. Although the aircraft themselves weren't new the in-flight experience and especially the food was exceptional. The difference between the food service on Air Canada and Avianca is night and day. Avianca has delicious food and interesting menus served with a smile. Air Canada has heated cardboard served reasonably efficiently but without any enthusiasm by flight attendants in dowdy uniforms. I'll be looking for alternative carriers to Air Canada from now on. Among North American airlines Delta gets my vote at the moment.,14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,2,0,0,1,[],0,7.0,5,1.4,0.0,0.043930211202938475,"['yesterday', 'flew', 'boeing', 'basically', 'lovely', 'plane', 'complaints', 'apply', 'every', 'taken', 'past', 'years', 'principally', 'terribly', 'uncomfortable', 'seats', 'b', 'lousiest', 'food', 'anywhere', 'seat', 'comfort', 'earth', 'designs', 'seat', 'short', 'puts', 'unbearable', 'pressure', 'middle', 'back', 'thighs', 'rouge', 'either', 'mainline', 'experience', 'torture', 'seats', 'close', 'together', 'knees', 'grinding', 'seat', 'front', 'average', 'sized', 'person', 'pounds', 'excuse', 'seat', 'comfortable', 'let', 'mention', 'fact', 'available', 'tilt', 'inches', 'front', 'back', 'zero', 'lumbar', 'support', 'b', 'long', 'ago', 'back', 'university', 'student', 'used', 'wonder', 'cafeteria', 'food', 'terrible', 'server', 'decent', 'meal', 'feet', 'pressurized', 'aluminium', 'tube', 'days', 'routinely', 'asked', 'leftover', 'meals', 'transatlantic', 'food', 'actually', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'awful', 'virtually', 'inedible', 'except', 'starving', 'yesterday', 'worst', 'recently', 'opportunity', 'fly', 'around', 'central', 'america', 'colombian', 'airline', 'avianca', 'although', 'aircraft', 'new', 'experience', 'especially', 'food', 'exceptional', 'difference', 'food', 'service', 'avianca', 'night', 'day', 'avianca', 'delicious', 'food', 'interesting', 'menus', 'served', 'smile', 'heated', 'cardboard', 'served', 'reasonably', 'efficiently', 'enthusiasm', 'attendants', 'dowdy', 'uniforms', 'looking', 'alternative', 'carriers', 'among', 'north', 'american', 'airlines', 'delta', 'gets', 'vote', 'moment']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,R Hoare,Not Verified,"Flew to the UK on a new ""Dreamliner"". Should be renamed a Squashliner. Air Canada has to be congratulated for cramming more seats into this aircraft than ever before. I paid a premium for the extra legroom seats behind business class. The aisle seat is placed right in the centre of the entry to the aisle of business class. This results in constant crashing of the food and beverage carts into the seat even though the new carts are narrower than those used on other aircraft. If the video screen which is in the armrest is used the situation is even worse. everybody trying to negotiate their way through the aircraft hits the screen.

Air Canada customer review,Tim Piper,Not Verified,"My wife was scheduled to fly from Montreal (YUL) to Toronto (YZZ) and then connecting to Minneapolis (MSP) on 01/04/15. Weather and de-icing delays kept passengers in the plane for over 3 hours waiting to depart from Montreal. She missed her connection in Toronto. Air Canada took no action during the 4 hour delay to rebook anyone who was going to miss their connecting flights. In the meantime AC's ""customer service"" number was continually busy. Stayed on hold for another 2 hours and finally got through to a booking agent. Got my wife rebooked for a later flight out of Toronto to MSP and wondered why this wasn't being handled internally by Air Canada. I notified my wife and she was able to check in and get to the gate in plenty of time for the later flight. I had a 3 hour drive to Minneapolis to pick her up. Just as I was getting on the interstate she text me saying that AC said there would be a slight delay but that it would be short. Halfway to Minneapolis I got another text saying that AC had cancelled the flight without explanation and were providing no assistance to stranded passengers. The gate agents were rude and simply told people they couldn't help them and that they would have to leave the gate area. What they failed to tell the stranded passengers was that they couldn't leave the secured area without assistance from AC or security. It was just by pure luck that my wife stopped an agent from another airline who explained that the passengers would need to be ""let out"" through a locked door so they could return to the ticketing area and start the entire process of booking a flight over again. Flights get delayed and cancelled that's just the way air travel has become. However Air Canada's total lack of regard for their passengers well being after a flight is cancelled was echoed by everyone flying Air Canada. The rudeness of the gate agents after the flight was cancelled and the empty promises of booking agents to assist stranded passengers was unparalleled. When the passengers were finally able to get to the ticketing area for Air Canada there were five queues with five functional computer terminals there were hundreds of people waiting in the five lines - but not a single Air Canada employee to be seen despite Air Canada's promises of assistance.",14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,[],0,5.0,5,1.0,0.0,0.054385964912280704,"['wife', 'scheduled', 'fly', 'montreal', 'yul', 'yzz', 'connecting', 'msp', 'weather', 'delays', 'kept', 'passengers', 'plane', 'hours', 'waiting', 'depart', 'montreal', 'missed', 'connection', 'took', 'action', 'hour', 'delay', 'rebook', 'anyone', 'going', 'miss', 'connecting', 'meantime', 'ac', 'customer', 'service', 'number', 'continually', 'busy', 'stayed', 'hold', 'another', 'hours', 'finally', 'booking', 'agent', 'wife', 'rebooked', 'later', 'msp', 'wondered', 'handled', 'internally', 'notified', 'wife', 'able', 'check', 'gate', 'plenty', 'time', 'later', 'hour', 'drive', 'pick', 'getting', 'interstate', 'text', 'saying', 'ac', 'slight', 'delay', 'short', 'halfway', 'another', 'text', 'saying', 'ac', 'cancelled', 'explanation', 'providing', 'assistance', 'stranded', 'passengers', 'gate', 'agents', 'rude', 'simply', 'told', 'people', 'help', 'leave', 'gate', 'area', 'failed', 'tell', 'stranded', 'passengers', 'leave', 'secured', 'area', 'assistance', 'ac', 'security', 'pure', 'luck', 'wife', 'stopped', 'agent', 'another', 'airline', 'explained', 'passengers', 'need', 'let', 'locked', 'door', 'return', 'ticketing', 'area', 'start', 'entire', 'process', 'booking', 'delayed', 'cancelled', 'way', 'travel', 'become', 'total', 'lack', 'regard', 'passengers', 'well', 'cancelled', 'echoed', 'everyone', 'flying', 'rudeness', 'gate', 'agents', 'cancelled', 'empty', 'promises', 'booking', 'agents', 'assist', 'stranded', 'passengers', 'unparalleled', 'passengers', 'finally', 'able', 'ticketing', 'area', 'five', 'queues', 'five', 'functional', 'computer', 'terminals', 'hundreds', 'people', 'waiting', 'five', 'lines', 'single', 'employee', 'seen', 'despite', 'promises', 'assistance']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Air Canada customer review,C Napier,Not Verified,Belfast - Montreal return. A rather unpleasant experience from start to finish. Best part of the trip was the flight to London only because that was on a codeshare flight with another airline. Air Canada flight from London to Halifax was on an old and dirty 767. Crew were rude and didn't have time for customers. Entertainment system dated and food was well below par of other airlines. Halifax to Montreal on a E175 and crew did bare minimum to pass their time onboard and again were just as unpleasant as the previous lot. My luggage got left in Halifax even though I had a 3 hour layover was reunited with my bags 2 days later with no apology offered when I returned to the airport to pick up lost luggage. Return flights were no better. Customer service and even customer interaction at the airport and on the aircraft isn't their strong point.

Air Canada customer review,Christopher Walden,Not Verified,Flew YVR - LHR - YVR in Executive first. The so called new suite on Air Canada's Boeing 777 on select routes only must be one of the worst business class seats ever designed. I was seated in 2D. When you first arrive at your seat you think that you have plenty of space. However once seated you soon feel very claustrophobic. The large arm rest on the left is made up by the very small armrest on the right which puts you very close to your neighbour. Just sitting normally ones left arm/hand naturally rests on the seat controls so without warning your seat starts moving. The tray table has a 3 phase deployment which could only be done by cabin crew. All passengers battled. Your seat can only be upright or flat with no in between settings. When flat the massage function on my seat would not turn off. It would only turn off when upright. When flat your feet go under the seat in front leaving no room to move your legs around. It's like laying in a coffin. There is no ground area for any luggage and no space for your duvet or pillow (which you are not allowed at your feet for take off / landing). All in all a very badly designed seat. I wasn't a great fan of the previous pod system but it is far better than this current design. I would rather have flown BA even with the backward facing seats. Service was good and the staff cannot be blamed for the tools they have been given to work with.

Offered menu choices soon after take off by meal time we were informed that they had run out of the beef option. In Business class no less! My wife didn't want the alternatives and therefore declined to eat. I told the attendant to give the beef to her and I'll have the salmon. The service director explained that even though we were full paying passengers there is a priority system there in terms of menu items. They had to take care of their Elite Super Elite and Million Milers before the others. We found this unbelievable in terms of a company policy. How much can it cost Air Canada to provide sufficient meal choices in J class? As it turned out the beef tenderloin was anything but tender or tasty. The rest of the flight was uneventful the seat was fairly comfortable and converted to flat bed easily. Turbulence prevented hot drinks service but that wasn't anyone's fault. The movie and TV choices were pretty pathetic compared to having just come off a Singapore Airlines business class segment from SIN to NRT. There was no comparison in the level of service the comfort and width of the seat and the meals. In fact when I mentioned this to the AC service director she candidly admitted that she was aware that they did not match up to SQ or Emirates in J class.

Trying to leave YYZ Air Canada could not provide more than one person at the gate and then did not have a flight crew available. The delays were not notified in advance and we could not cancel hotel reservations. We missed connecting flight in Houston but were informed that United was holding flight for us. When we arrived at United counter they informed us that they told AC that flight was not held so we returned to AC counter only to find it closed. We then went looking for baggage and were told that the baggage was never included on flight out and then hung up on us. We have now spent five days waiting for baggage with no information provided to us or partner carriers very unusual. Typical response is apology with no further information or update nor return call of any sort. Complete incompetence exhibited by AC throughout this process and direct and outright lies in regards to continued correspondence with the firm. I will never fly with this airline again.,22nd December 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,[],0,6.0,5,1.2,0.0,0.03277777777777779,"['flew', 'san', 'jose', 'cr', 'via', 'trying', 'leave', 'yyz', 'provide', 'person', 'gate', 'crew', 'available', 'delays', 'notified', 'advance', 'cancel', 'hotel', 'reservations', 'missed', 'connecting', 'informed', 'united', 'holding', 'arrived', 'united', 'counter', 'informed', 'told', 'ac', 'held', 'returned', 'ac', 'counter', 'find', 'closed', 'looking', 'baggage', 'told', 'baggage', 'never', 'included', 'hung', 'spent', 'five', 'days', 'waiting', 'baggage', 'information', 'provided', 'partner', 'carriers', 'unusual', 'typical', 'response', 'apology', 'information', 'update', 'return', 'call', 'sort', 'complete', 'incompetence', 'exhibited', 'ac', 'throughout', 'process', 'direct', 'outright', 'lies', 'regards', 'continued', 'correspondence', 'firm', 'never', 'fly', 'airline']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Janet Johnson,Not Verified,Service has deteriorated every year in the last 5 years. The staff at the airport representing Air Canada treat customers with disdain and do nothing to communicate delays etc. We are always left to guess about delays since no announcements are made. There is absolutely no courtesy shown towards regular customers. We are treated in a way that shows that our business is not valued at all. I only fly Air Canada because I have no choice where I live. I am happy WestJet will finally be providing service out of my local airport. At least then I will be able to experience some courtesy and satisfaction when I have to fly anywhere.,22nd December 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,3,3,0,0,1,[],0,9.0,5,1.8,0.0,0.2027972027972028,"['service', 'deteriorated', 'every', 'year', 'last', 'years', 'staff', 'airport', 'representing', 'treat', 'customers', 'disdain', 'nothing', 'communicate', 'delays', 'etc', 'always', 'left', 'guess', 'delays', 'since', 'announcements', 'absolutely', 'courtesy', 'shown', 'towards', 'regular', 'customers', 'treated', 'way', 'shows', 'business', 'valued', 'fly', 'choice', 'live', 'happy', 'westjet', 'finally', 'providing', 'service', 'local', 'airport', 'least', 'able', 'experience', 'courtesy', 'satisfaction', 'fly', 'anywhere']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Zach Zmuda,Not Verified,"Decided a few years ago to commit to flying with Air Canada (live in Toronto) as I knew I would be traveling quite a bit to London for work and for consistency of booking and to take advantage of the loyalty program I wanted to stick with one airline. As a disclaimer for these flights I was not ""overly"" concerned about pricing but rather timing and comfort. That said I definitely wasn't willing to pay insane prices. In my opinion and for how I was traveling Air Canada has been by far the best airline I have traveled with (I have not flown airlines such as Emirates as they don't offer the routes I need but of course I have heard good things). There is no question that a direct AC flight to your destination might be more expensive than flying with another airline with one or 2 connections. If you are not too worried about spending more time traveling and in result save a few bucks - then go for it. That said where AC really shines is comfort and from my experiences service. The no. 1 reason I fly AC is comfort. In economy there is a good amount of leg room. If you disagree try flying United in row 30 and then report back. Secondly there is free in-flight entertainment in every seat. The flight from Heathrow to Toronto will fly by with a movie and some TV shows. Thirdly the first class cabin on the YYZ-LHR route was incredible. I am a light sleeper and also 6'2"" and even with the decent economy seats in AC economy I still have trouble sleeping. As most of the YYZ to LHR flights are red-eyes and I need to be rested for meetings when I arrive - I often spent the extra money (or later on upgrade credits) to fly in business. I don't care if Emirates gives you a hot towel to exfoliate your face halfway through the flight what AC provided was a great lay-flat bed in a semi-private pod and I got a good 6 hours of sleep. It was invaluable. Where the true service came through was on the return. When getting a ride back to LHR there was crazy traffic on the M1. Airlines recommend arriving to LHR three hours before your flight. I arrived 45 mins before the flight. The AC staff were so helpful in getting me checked in and somehow got me on a golf cart and I was driven through the bowels of the airport escorted through security back on another golf cart that drove through random hallways passed luggage belts arriving right at the gate just before they closed the doors. Sure maybe some of that treatment was because I was booked in the first class cabin but I have had equally great experiences when booked in economy.",22nd December 2014,,First Class,,,5,4,3,5,0,0,4,[],0,21.0,5,4.2,0.0,0.21641654641654648,"['decided', 'years', 'ago', 'commit', 'flying', 'live', 'knew', 'traveling', 'quite', 'bit', 'work', 'consistency', 'booking', 'take', 'advantage', 'loyalty', 'program', 'wanted', 'stick', 'airline', 'disclaimer', 'overly', 'concerned', 'pricing', 'rather', 'timing', 'comfort', 'definitely', 'willing', 'pay', 'insane', 'prices', 'opinion', 'traveling', 'far', 'best', 'airline', 'traveled', 'flown', 'airlines', 'emirates', 'offer', 'routes', 'need', 'course', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'question', 'direct', 'ac', 'destination', 'might', 'expensive', 'flying', 'another', 'airline', 'connections', 'worried', 'spending', 'time', 'traveling', 'result', 'save', 'bucks', 'ac', 'really', 'shines', 'comfort', 'experiences', 'service', 'reason', 'fly', 'ac', 'comfort', 'economy', 'good', 'amount', 'leg', 'room', 'disagree', 'try', 'flying', 'united', 'row', 'report', 'back', 'secondly', 'free', 'entertainment', 'every', 'seat', 'heathrow', 'fly', 'movie', 'tv', 'shows', 'thirdly', 'first', 'class', 'cabin', 'route', 'incredible', 'light', 'sleeper', 'decent', 'economy', 'seats', 'ac', 'economy', 'still', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'yyz', 'lhr', 'need', 'rested', 'meetings', 'arrive', 'often', 'spent', 'extra', 'money', 'later', 'upgrade', 'credits', 'fly', 'business', 'care', 'emirates', 'gives', 'hot', 'towel', 'exfoliate', 'face', 'halfway', 'ac', 'provided', 'great', 'bed', 'pod', 'good', 'hours', 'sleep', 'invaluable', 'true', 'service', 'came', 'return', 'getting', 'ride', 'back', 'lhr', 'crazy', 'traffic', 'airlines', 'recommend', 'arriving', 'lhr', 'three', 'hours', 'arrived', 'mins', 'ac', 'staff', 'helpful', 'getting', 'checked', 'somehow', 'golf', 'cart', 'driven', 'bowels', 'airport', 'escorted', 'security', 'back', 'another', 'golf', 'cart', 'drove', 'random', 'hallways', 'passed', 'luggage', 'belts', 'arriving', 'right', 'gate', 'closed', 'doors', 'sure', 'maybe', 'treatment', 'booked', 'first', 'class', 'cabin', 'equally', 'great', 'experiences', 'booked', 'economy']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Jan Cafferty,Not Verified,From start to finish my experience of Air Canada was one I don't want to repeat unfortunately. From them changing planes and not notifying me so the exit row seat I'd paid for to accommodate my 6ft 5 son was no longer available to the poor quality food on the plane (the vegetarian tea time snack consisted of a banana plum and Satsuma) and the functional but not welcoming staff and the very narrow seat on the 787 all in all a very disappointing experience. The only plus points I could find were the online check in and bag drop and the entertainment system on the 787.I would best describe Air Canada as a transatlantic budget airline but maybe I've been spoilt by travelling with far superior airlines in economy class in the past.,22nd December 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,3,0,0,1,[],0,7.0,5,1.4,0.0,0.0009999999999999898,"['start', 'finish', 'experience', 'want', 'repeat', 'unfortunately', 'changing', 'planes', 'notifying', 'exit', 'row', 'seat', 'paid', 'accommodate', 'son', 'longer', 'available', 'poor', 'quality', 'food', 'plane', 'vegetarian', 'tea', 'time', 'snack', 'consisted', 'banana', 'plum', 'satsuma', 'functional', 'welcoming', 'staff', 'narrow', 'seat', 'disappointing', 'experience', 'plus', 'points', 'find', 'online', 'check', 'bag', 'drop', 'entertainment', 'system', 'best', 'describe', 'transatlantic', 'budget', 'airline', 'maybe', 'spoilt', 'travelling', 'far', 'superior', 'airlines', 'economy', 'class', 'past']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Air Canada customer review,A Mark,Not Verified,London Heathrow to Vancouver via Toronto. Was looking forward to trying the 787 Dreamliner. Well what a disappointment. Firstly Air Canada somehow managed to offload us from the flight in London and this was only realised when they scanned our boarding cards at the gate. In the meantime Air Canada had sold our assigned seats to someone else and after much stress we were eventually given seats right at the back of the plane. No apology from any of the crew on board for the stress caused by a problem entirely their own fault. Underwhelmed by the 787 looks like any other new aircraft on the inside the seating is narrow due to the tight 9 across seating and the plane seemed quite noisy. This accompanied by the typically forgettable Air Canada service meant I left that plane with nothing good to say about Air Canada. Connection at Toronto was tight due to our late running inbound flight. Our 777 to Vancouver had been swapped from a high density one to a standard one with less seats you can imagine the chaos at the gate as the flight was now oversold. Again more seating changes for us and we were now seated in economy middle aisle instead of Premium Economy. Overall a totally unpleasant experience made more stressful by Air Canada at every stage. I don't need this when I fly and will now take my business elsewhere.,18th December 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,3,0,0,1,[],0,8.0,5,1.6,0.0,0.03511672850958565,"['heathrow', 'via', 'looking', 'forward', 'trying', 'dreamliner', 'well', 'disappointment', 'firstly', 'somehow', 'managed', 'offload', 'realised', 'scanned', 'boarding', 'cards', 'gate', 'meantime', 'sold', 'assigned', 'seats', 'someone', 'else', 'much', 'stress', 'eventually', 'given', 'seats', 'right', 'back', 'plane', 'apology', 'crew', 'board', 'stress', 'caused', 'problem', 'entirely', 'fault', 'underwhelmed', 'looks', 'like', 'new', 'aircraft', 'inside', 'seating', 'narrow', 'due', 'tight', 'across', 'seating', 'plane', 'seemed', 'quite', 'noisy', 'accompanied', 'typically', 'forgettable', 'service', 'meant', 'left', 'plane', 'nothing', 'good', 'connection', 'tight', 'due', 'late', 'running', 'inbound', 'swapped', 'high', 'density', 'standard', 'less', 'seats', 'imagine', 'chaos', 'gate', 'oversold', 'seating', 'changes', 'seated', 'economy', 'middle', 'aisle', 'instead', 'premium', 'economy', 'overall', 'totally', 'unpleasant', 'experience', 'stressful', 'every', 'stage', 'need', 'fly', 'take', 'business', 'elsewhere']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Air Canada customer review,G Cassie,Not Verified,"YVR to NRT. First off you can fly YVR to Haneda on ANA. I recommend that route. Narita is such a hassle even on the ""direct"" NEX train it takes an hour into Tokyo and that is after the long haul flight after Customs after waiting for a train before you transfer again in Tokyo or even if your hotel is near a station make the 900 meter walk out of Tokyo Central or Shinagawa. (I am not exaggerating. The time it takes to wheel your luggage from the NEX at Central to the lobby at the Shangri-La is nearly 20 minutes and that's when the station is relatively quiet.) AC was using an older aircraft on this route and it wasn't really too noticeable until we flew back on something much better (Cathay). The biz config in AC with their very comfortable if a tad firm lie flat seats afford privacy and ensure a good rest. The AV system is good although the screens aren't too big. Crew was extremely attentive and very friendly. One even had a sense of humour! The first meal was half decent quite good. The second a breakfast was mediocre. I find the ""second"" meal on AC long haul flights is always a letdown. The wine on AC could be better.

Air Canada customer review,J Waterman,Not Verified,Toronto to London - I booked 3 seats and had them pre-assigned so we could all sit together. This was confirmed and the seats allocated. When I arrived at the plane the crew had split our seats up and would not change other seating so we could sit together. My 4 year old was initially sat alone next to a stranger. The result was that I could not go to the bathroom with my son without leaving my baby. I could not change my baby without leaving my son alone - my wife was 30 odd rows away. The stewardesses would not help us get food from bags (which were all with my wife because we were meant to be sat together). When I complained through customer relations I was told that it is always challenging travelling with children.

Air Canada customer review,Stephen Sacks,Not Verified,"A lot of anticipation on flying the AC Dreamliner - a large spacious quiet aircraft that just eases the flight hours away - not - Air Canada decided to put in very small aisles tiny uncomfortable seats and an entertainment system that doesn't tilt. I'm 5'4"" and 135 pounds so if I can't fit in a seat - something is drastically wrong! And I couldn't get comfortable - the flights to/from Europe were each 12 hours of misery. How greedy could AC be as to try to fit in that many seats? The plane is already super-efficient - so having an aisle seat is awful - you will constantly get your elbows arms and feet banged by the flight attendants. Add to that - the washrooms are so small I couldn't even fit in. And the toilet seats refuse to stay up!

Air Canada customer review,H Vandervoort,Not Verified,"Problem with Air Canada was that Air NZ was our main carrier and they use Air Canada for the YYZ/LA and LA/YYZ leg at end.

A 5hr one with AC got you a cup of lukewarm coffee. ANZ staff chatted and joked with customers. Air Canada's just went through the motions. It really felt like a ""bus run"".

Air Canada customer review,M John,Not Verified,"I recently travelled on AC from Vancouver to Heathrow and back. I had a premium economy seat booked on the outbound leg and an economy seat for the return but had purchased a preferred seat. I upgraded to business class on both legs on check in for $900 on the way out and 900 Pounds on the way back! AC have managed to hide their business check-in at YVR and LHR I had to ask both times where it was. At YVR its basically in the Domestic check- in section of the airport. The check-in agent mentioned that I had a good seat (4A) which is a single seat by itself. My heart sank a little when she mentioned that the aircraft had a 'high density' configuration. Airline speak for a plane where they have crammed in more seats. Onboard I found the new business seating terrible clearly designed for short narrow people. Once the seat is in lay flat mode your legs go into a narrow gap under the seat in front of you. I'm 6' and 230lbs and had a few centimetres of room to the side and above before my lower legs were hitting the sides of the available space. The seat feels narrower than before making the whole thing coffin like. The pods were much better and offered more privacy. This particular seat had excessively large armrests some of that space would have been better used to widen the seat. Where the seat controls are positioned you will hit them when you use the armrests in the regular fashion causing the seat to move when you don't want it to. When I mentioned to one of the cabin crew about the seat comfort he said ""I know we're ripping them out'. Clearly gone are the days of the $600 or less last minute upgrade to business. I don't think that the new charges justify what you get. Otherwise the staff were friendly enough the food was ok and the cabin was too hot. If you happen to do an upgrade to business from economy and paid for an economy cabin preferred seat email them to get your $90 back otherwise you wont get it. Finally I had a look behind the curtain at Premium Economy certainly didn't look like the pictures on the AC website which gives the impression that its somewhat separate from regular economy it isn't. Although I make an internal connection within the UK from Heathrow I will be giving KLM a try next time to Amsterdam where onward connections are still good. Their business upgrades are typically $500.",17th November 2014,,Business Class,,,2,3,3,4,0,0,3,[],0,15.0,5,3.0,0.0,0.08687682472566194,"['recently', 'travelled', 'ac', 'heathrow', 'back', 'premium', 'economy', 'seat', 'booked', 'outbound', 'leg', 'economy', 'seat', 'return', 'purchased', 'preferred', 'seat', 'upgraded', 'business', 'class', 'legs', 'check', 'way', 'pounds', 'way', 'back', 'ac', 'managed', 'hide', 'business', 'yvr', 'lhr', 'ask', 'times', 'yvr', 'basically', 'domestic', 'section', 'airport', 'agent', 'mentioned', 'good', 'seat', 'single', 'seat', 'heart', 'sank', 'little', 'mentioned', 'aircraft', 'density', 'configuration', 'airline', 'speak', 'plane', 'crammed', 'seats', 'onboard', 'found', 'new', 'business', 'seating', 'terrible', 'clearly', 'designed', 'short', 'narrow', 'people', 'seat', 'lay', 'flat', 'mode', 'legs', 'narrow', 'gap', 'seat', 'front', 'centimetres', 'room', 'side', 'lower', 'legs', 'hitting', 'sides', 'available', 'space', 'seat', 'feels', 'narrower', 'making', 'whole', 'thing', 'coffin', 'like', 'pods', 'much', 'better', 'offered', 'privacy', 'particular', 'seat', 'excessively', 'large', 'armrests', 'space', 'better', 'used', 'widen', 'seat', 'seat', 'controls', 'positioned', 'hit', 'use', 'armrests', 'regular', 'fashion', 'causing', 'seat', 'move', 'want', 'mentioned', 'cabin', 'crew', 'seat', 'comfort', 'know', 'ripping', 'clearly', 'gone', 'days', 'less', 'last', 'minute', 'upgrade', 'business', 'think', 'new', 'charges', 'justify', 'otherwise', 'staff', 'friendly', 'enough', 'food', 'ok', 'cabin', 'hot', 'happen', 'upgrade', 'business', 'economy', 'paid', 'economy', 'cabin', 'preferred', 'seat', 'email', 'back', 'otherwise', 'wont', 'finally', 'look', 'behind', 'curtain', 'premium', 'economy', 'certainly', 'look', 'like', 'pictures', 'ac', 'website', 'gives', 'impression', 'somewhat', 'separate', 'regular', 'economy', 'although', 'make', 'internal', 'connection', 'within', 'uk', 'heathrow', 'giving', 'klm', 'try', 'time', 'onward', 'connections', 'still', 'good', 'business', 'upgrades', 'typically']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Corner Geo,Not Verified,A return flight from Vancouver to Heathrow was very disappointing in many ways. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. During the long overnight flight the cabin was ridiculously and uncomfortably warm making sleep difficult there was an unsettled noisy baby on board to whose parents the flight crew offered no help and due to the stupid design of the seats incorporating lights and volume controls in the top of the arm rests it was quite impossible to rest ones arms or support oneself on these armrests. The delay however then created the greatest problems. Passengers with onward connections were told to contact Air Canada ground crew. We were assured we had been rebooked on a later BA flight to Edinburgh. There was not actually enough time to transfer to the flight in Terminal 5 but that in itself did not matter as we (and many other passengers) had been misled. None of us had been rebooked.

Air Canada customer review,P Rubenstein,Not Verified,AC through its contract partner Sky Regional YUL-YTZ (RT DH4 service). Although the equipment is old and the seating is cramped the overall flight experience was good. Advance check-in eliminated the hassle of YUL check-in and aside from a change in gate at departure everything went smoothly. Changing my departure on the return was easily done at the airport by a pleasant agent. I used the MLL in YUL courtesy of my Elite status. Although the lounge was crowded I was surprised by the improved range of food available. The MLL agent was polite and smiling (in the past they have been grouchy). Significant improvement at the YUL MLL in the last year. The departure area at YTZ is shared with Porter and is run down shabby and crowded. Both flights were nearly on time despite weather conditions. This was my first use of AC at YTZ in many years as I have been a loyal client of Porter. I gave AC a try because of my displeasure with my past Porter flights specifically the deterioration in service and on time performance. AC is just as good if not better than Porter on this route and with my FF status the AC experience was superior overall.

Air Canada customer review,V Grewal,Not Verified,"I've flown AC before but luckily with folks that work with the airline thus a very favorable fare (tax only). Our most recent trip to Europe included a one-way flight from YVR to LAX for a 3-day layover for some fun in the sun. We asked to be moved up to an earlier flight as we were meeting some friends in LA so I contacted AC reservations three times and got three different stories. I decided to go to the airport the day off early and asked where I could change my flight. This is where the unfriendly cold staff interactions begin. When I asked where I could go to change my booking the lady proceeded to hold up a finger telling me to pause while she scrutinized carry on bag sizes for passengers then when she ""had a moment"" pointed in the general direction of a service desk and said ""there!"". A short walk and 10 minute wait in the line led me to another miserable lady who told me I should be in the international terminal since I'm flying to LA but in this case ""she'd make an exception"". I proceeded to ask her if there were two different operating companies for domestic versus US flights knowing the answer. The lady gave a short and concise ""no"" response and proceeded to tap away at her computer for minutes without looking up or saying a word. Her next words were to give me the outrageous ""change fee"" costs which I paid to get the ordeal over with. When I asked about the policy change she said didn't give any explanation other than ""that's the way it is now."" Inflight the staff were even worse.

Air Canada customer review,D Boothroyd,Not Verified,AC 1173 to Vancouver on October 12 and returned to Toronto on AC 152 October 19. It appears that AC flight attendants hate their job and are only too pleased to show this to the passengers. On the first flight one of the attendants was barely civil. Return flight a repeat performance with a different attendant. At boarding time I wondered why no attendant was welcoming passengers or being helpful at the rear of the plane where we were seated. An attendant was there alright seated in her position and doing absolutely nothing. During the flight she managed to serve the drinks before sitting down in the last row to read eat and watch a movie. Her colleague was somewhat more professional. I am wondering however what has happened to civility to say nothing of service. These people don't seem to understand that they are there for the passengers not the other way around. One sees nothing like it on the other major Canadian airline in Europe or in Asia where flight attendants still consider friendliness and service as part of their job. Appropriate training and supervision is definitely in order.,28th October 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,2,0,0,2,[],0,8.0,5,1.6,0.0,0.06615497076023391,"['ac', 'october', 'returned', 'ac', 'october', 'appears', 'ac', 'attendants', 'hate', 'job', 'pleased', 'show', 'passengers', 'first', 'attendants', 'barely', 'civil', 'return', 'repeat', 'performance', 'different', 'attendant', 'boarding', 'time', 'wondered', 'attendant', 'welcoming', 'passengers', 'helpful', 'rear', 'plane', 'seated', 'attendant', 'alright', 'seated', 'position', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'managed', 'serve', 'drinks', 'sitting', 'last', 'row', 'read', 'eat', 'watch', 'movie', 'colleague', 'somewhat', 'professional', 'wondering', 'happened', 'civility', 'nothing', 'service', 'people', 'seem', 'understand', 'passengers', 'way', 'around', 'sees', 'nothing', 'like', 'major', 'canadian', 'airline', 'europe', 'asia', 'attendants', 'still', 'consider', 'friendliness', 'service', 'part', 'job', 'appropriate', 'training', 'supervision', 'definitely', 'order']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Paula King,Not Verified,I was very disappointed with the airline. On my way to the airport I got a text saying my connecting flight was cancelled and they had to re-route us. I was to arrive at my destination at 0930 in the morning and didn't get there until 5 in the evening. I had a 2 hour wait in one airport and a 3 hour wait in another. This was not acceptable to me as I was travelling with my husband who is a dialysis patient and had meds with him that had to be kept cold also my 75 year old mother who has problems walking. Not once did we get an apology or even a food voucher to eat. Thankfully we were only travelling from Deer Lake to Toronto - usually a 2.5 hour flight but took us 11 hours.

Air Canada customer review,McKelvie Donald,Not Verified,Having had two bad experiences with Air Canada I will never fly with them again. First issue: Booked to depart Vancouver at 0800 on 1 Aug 14 on a flight to Toronto we arrived at the airport early. Checked our bags and got our boarding passes however on the boarding pass it did not have a seat allocation but indicated that this would be done at the gate no problem. As we had cleared security and it was now only 0620 we casually got a coffee and wandered up to the gate. On arrival at the gate my wife went to the desk to get our seat allocation only to be berated by the desk person who told her they had been paging us we didn't hear anything. He then informed her that our flight was boarding. We said that our flight wasn't until 0800 he then told us that our original flight was delayed until 1000 and we had been placed on the one now departing. Obviously had we not arrived early we would have been waiting around until 1000. All well and good but why weren't we informed of the change when we check in? Arriving early in Toronto messed with our booked transport which caused a few anxious moments and we had to get a taxi however thanks to Viator we got a refund on our transport booking. Second issue: The next flight was from Toronto to Seattle (E90) 3 Aug 14. On this fight the cabin crew showed a complete disregard for the comfort of the passengers. We were seated in the second last row of seats and were very conscious of people using the toilet no problem. However the flight had a number of turbulence issues and at one stage the line up for the toilet was half way up the cabin. On a number of occasions people asked if they could use the toilet at the front of the aircraft and this was denied. It did not help matters with the seatbelt sign going on and off. At one stage a young girl who had been waiting a long time got to the front of the line only to be told to go back and put her shoes on. I have never been told to put my shoes on. Anyway all that said I will never fly Air Canada again. The first impression is always the best and lasting impression.,22nd October 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,1,1,1,0,0,3,[],0,10.0,5,2.0,0.0,0.019343434343434343,"['bad', 'experiences', 'never', 'fly', 'first', 'issue', 'booked', 'depart', 'aug', 'arrived', 'airport', 'early', 'checked', 'bags', 'boarding', 'passes', 'boarding', 'pass', 'seat', 'allocation', 'indicated', 'done', 'gate', 'problem', 'cleared', 'security', 'casually', 'coffee', 'wandered', 'gate', 'arrival', 'gate', 'wife', 'desk', 'seat', 'allocation', 'berated', 'desk', 'person', 'told', 'paging', 'hear', 'anything', 'informed', 'boarding', 'told', 'original', 'delayed', 'placed', 'departing', 'obviously', 'arrived', 'early', 'waiting', 'around', 'well', 'good', 'informed', 'change', 'check', 'arriving', 'early', 'messed', 'booked', 'transport', 'caused', 'anxious', 'moments', 'taxi', 'thanks', 'viator', 'refund', 'transport', 'booking', 'second', 'issue', 'aug', 'fight', 'cabin', 'crew', 'showed', 'complete', 'disregard', 'comfort', 'passengers', 'seated', 'second', 'last', 'row', 'seats', 'conscious', 'people', 'using', 'toilet', 'problem', 'number', 'turbulence', 'issues', 'stage', 'line', 'toilet', 'half', 'way', 'cabin', 'number', 'occasions', 'people', 'asked', 'use', 'toilet', 'front', 'aircraft', 'denied', 'help', 'matters', 'seatbelt', 'sign', 'going', 'stage', 'young', 'girl', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'front', 'line', 'told', 'back', 'put', 'shoes', 'never', 'told', 'put', 'shoes', 'anyway', 'never', 'fly', 'first', 'impression', 'always', 'best', 'lasting', 'impression']","['customer', 'review']",pos

After scanning our passports the Air Canada attendant told us that because my husband and son has the same first names it causes problems for their system. She was very rude about the whole situation! Arrived in Toronto where the attendants were more professional and friendly.

Air Canada customer review,Golding Jenny,Not Verified,I travelled from London Heathrow to Calgary return. Check in was speedy. There wasn't a queue to get through security so the Fast Track didn't make much difference. The lounge at Heathrow was spacious and comfortable and the food selection was fine. The 1:2:1 seat formation ensured privacy and the lie flat seat was comfortable and just wide enough. I'm 5ft 7in but if you were much taller or bigger it would be a tight squeeze. The food selection was ok fish meat or veggie but all choices were available. My salmon was well cooked and the vegetables were hot and not overcooked. There was a choice of 2 white wines one of which was not available due to all stock being used on the incoming sector! Come on I'm sure LHR has a pretty good catering set up. I don't drink Chardonnay or red wine (3 choices) so I had to drink beer instead. This really is unacceptable in Business Class. And why no Canadian wines? The service on both sectors was efficient and friendly so no complaints there. I can't comment on inflight entertainment as I didn't use it. The WC's were shocking. They smelt like a public urinal with wet floor and paper stuck to the floor - and this was 1 hour into the flight. They obviously hadn't been cleaned at the turnaround. The lounge at Calgary is being refurbished so it was crowded and not very comfortable. All the chairs had rips or worn arms so the refurb is well overdue. The flight back was ok I got my wine this time! The toiletries supplied were an unknown brand and not worth bothering with very basic. For the amount of money paid for Business Class they could do better. It's more like Premium Economy except for lie flat beds. If the LHR/Calgary sector had Premium Economy I would have taken it. Next time I will try Canadian Affair (charter) Premium Economy. This was a leisure trip so expense was very important as I was paying! If Economy is well priced on Air Canada it may be worth it but not Business Class.,12th October 2014,,Business Class,,,4,4,3,1,0,0,3,[],0,15.0,5,3.0,0.0,0.1378974124166432,"['travelled', 'heathrow', 'return', 'check', 'speedy', 'queue', 'security', 'fast', 'track', 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'lounge', 'heathrow', 'spacious', 'comfortable', 'food', 'selection', 'fine', 'seat', 'formation', 'ensured', 'privacy', 'lie', 'flat', 'seat', 'comfortable', 'wide', 'enough', 'much', 'taller', 'bigger', 'tight', 'squeeze', 'food', 'selection', 'ok', 'fish', 'meat', 'veggie', 'choices', 'available', 'salmon', 'well', 'cooked', 'vegetables', 'hot', 'overcooked', 'choice', 'white', 'wines', 'available', 'due', 'stock', 'used', 'incoming', 'sector', 'come', 'sure', 'lhr', 'pretty', 'good', 'catering', 'set', 'drink', 'chardonnay', 'red', 'wine', 'choices', 'drink', 'beer', 'instead', 'really', 'unacceptable', 'business', 'class', 'canadian', 'wines', 'service', 'sectors', 'efficient', 'friendly', 'complaints', 'ca', 'comment', 'inflight', 'entertainment', 'use', 'wc', 'shocking', 'smelt', 'like', 'public', 'urinal', 'wet', 'floor', 'paper', 'stuck', 'floor', 'hour', 'obviously', 'cleaned', 'turnaround', 'lounge', 'refurbished', 'crowded', 'comfortable', 'chairs', 'rips', 'worn', 'arms', 'refurb', 'well', 'overdue', 'back', 'ok', 'wine', 'time', 'toiletries', 'supplied', 'unknown', 'brand', 'worth', 'bothering', 'basic', 'amount', 'money', 'paid', 'business', 'class', 'better', 'like', 'premium', 'economy', 'except', 'lie', 'flat', 'beds', 'sector', 'premium', 'economy', 'taken', 'time', 'try', 'canadian', 'affair', 'charter', 'premium', 'economy', 'leisure', 'trip', 'expense', 'important', 'paying', 'economy', 'well', 'priced', 'may', 'worth', 'business', 'class']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Naz Karnai,Not Verified,Myself and my wife along with a 3 year old we took a flight from Toronto - Vancouver. Staff were very rude at check-in at the boarding gate as well as on the flight itself. I requested a pillow and a blanket for my son who was very sleepy as we had transited from UK the air crew rudely said to me that we have to pay for it I didn't mind paying but it is something unheard of. I travel so often but never asked to pay for these things even in the cheapest airlines in Europe like Ryanair EasyJet etc. I will never recommend Air Canada to anyone and will never fly with them again in the future.

Air Canada customer review,R Tilling,Not Verified,"B777-300 Vancouver-London Heathrow 2 Sep 2014. The new business class seat is terrible - narrow short ridiculously sized and shaped. It's okay as a seat but I paid for a good night's sleep. Forget it! I'm 6ft 4 and when the seat turns into a bed it slides the lower half of your body into a tiny plastic coffin-like box with no room to move your legs at all. It wasn't long enough for me - so it wasn't humanly possible to lie down! As a result I arrived at LHR tired and irritable lacking the sleep I had needed and paid for. The cabin crew were brilliant but they told me that a lot of other business class passengers had complained about this new seat. It's also difficult to get the seat back up again from a thr ""bed"". My seat 2A on C-FIVO was also missing a flexible reading light. It is a reasonably new aircraft so why on earth was that missing? Basically Air Canada has decided to shove more seats in every class onto this aircraft at the expense of comfort and space and every passenger is short-changed as a result. The B777-300ER that normally takes 359 passengers is being converted to 458 passengers - mine was one of them. The passenger loses. I have read that it is a plan to reduce cost per seat by 15%. It is a total disgrace - avoid this aircraft at all costs. Air Canada used to be a great airline but it is heading downhill.

Air Canada customer review,C Wu,Not Verified,"I assumed that a large country like Canada would be a safe bet for my trip to New York. On the way out staff were a slow and unhelpful but our main complaint was the food - we boarded at 12 so assumed lunch would be provided instead a 'light snack' was served at 2.30 and there was no meat option because they had already run out. Before landing we were served another 'light snack' which was the smallest wrap I have seen. On the way home our flight was delayed at LGA for over an hour with barely any communication until we could board. Onboard my sister asked the attendant if we would make our connection - he looked at our ticket and said probably not without any sympathy or conciliatory expression. When he gave us immigration cards my sister told him we didn't need them as we were only transferring. He said ""you might if you have to stay overnight in Canada"" - a possibility that had not yet been suggested to us and which was delivered in an incredibly flippant way considering we had told him we had important work engagements we needed to keep the next morning. When we got to Montreal we rushed to the connections gate where Air Canada staff who were supposed to guide us told us the plane wasn't waiting for us despite there still being time to make it. The rest of the evening was spent walking from end to end of the airport as Air Canada staff constantly referred you to different colleagues for help.

We brushed it off and believed it was just a bad day for them. Our return flight was no better. The flight back was from Athens Greece to Montreal and then Toronto. The sad thing was instead of returning home to Toronto on Saturday 4.30pm as our tickets stated we had the privilege of being bumped off our flight and sleeping at the Montreal airport with my 12 year old son and husband. No explanation was given except for ""sorry this flight is overbooked"". We had assigned seats and everything so how does this happen??

Air Canada customer review,D Mayoh,Not Verified,Flew from Honolulu to Vancouver economy class. Ground staff were helpful and reasonably friendly. The plane was a 767-300 and the seat was very uncomfortable as the padding in the middle of the seat had vanished over the years. The four stewardesses in my area must have been 60ish and not up to speed. One stewardess asked a passenger to get out of his seat and close the overhead bin as she had a bad back. Knowing that Air Canada did not serve meals domestically I checked online about international flights and it said that meals were served. None provided. During the flight I was offered a decent beverage twice and a couple of times the stewardess came by with a tacky plastic jug and served lukewarm water. I travel to and from Asia quite often and have never experienced such poor service on any other airline.

Air Canada customer review,S Simpkins,Not Verified,Montreal YUL to Boston BOS on Air Canada Express CRJ100. Checked in online but still needed to use airport machines to print boarding cards and luggage tags assisted by pleasant AC staff. With this small aircraft you have to leave cabin cases at the door and they are returned to you on landing although there were the usual few passengers who decided this reasonable rule did not apply to them. Announcements in the air virtually inaudible because the FA held the microphone too close to her mouth and then shouted into it - training issue here. Drink and snack served on this short flight. Being a small aircraft it twitches a bit in flight so nervous flyers should be aware.

Air Canada customer review,R Wu,Not Verified,We recently returned from New York La Guardia airport to London Heathrow. Our first flight was delayed which meant we missed our connecting flight to London. Both my sister and I missed several appointments - work for myself and registration for her PhD and meetings for my sister. It was also my sister's 25th birthday which is an extra detail but made the subsequent experience much worse to take. Our return flight included a connection at Montreal - the plane from New York was delayed and from the offset the staff on the plane were incredibly rude disengaged and unhelpful when we asked for advice and reassurance. The whole process was terribly managed - we arrived at the boarding gate in time to see our plane pull away from the gate - some better communications and we definitely could have boarded that flight with a five minute delay for the other passengers at most. We were then sent around the airport with cursory explanations and a lack of basic guidance - for example no one explained there was a shuttle bus to the hotel or even pointed us in the right direction. There was a lack of staff in the airport due to it being a bit later in the evening and we felt completely unguided in the process. I was stunned that a customer-focused service could have such a poor grasp of good communications and moreover just didn't seem to care about it's customers as well. We arrived in London 12 hours after our scheduled arrival time. Overall the process was poor in itself - bad food stingy amounts. When my sister asked if we would be served another meal the attendant smirked and said 'You could loosely call it a meal'.

Air Canada customer review,Richard Moller,Not Verified,Flying from Kingston Ontario to London Heathrow is a tiring trip at the best of times delays at the start when a plane needs additional time and maintenance to be flightworthy only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston. Due to maintenance issues the entertainment system on the Toronto to Heathrow leg had to be completely rebooted mid-flight making it unusable for about an hour. Luggage handling was slow and bags marked “Priority” were some of the last ones off.

Air Canada customer review,Jim Mitchell,Not Verified,Over the last two years we have taken 31 flights. Of those flights 11 were on Air Canada and on 8 of those 11 there were either delays of more than two hours or cancellations. My most recent was on Air Canada YVR to YEG - the flight was cancelled and it created a great deal of confusion for Air Canada. First they would let us know about putting on other flights in 15 minutes half an hour later they were still confused and lost. They said they would give a lunch voucher but couldn't get them to print and that took 45 minutes. Finally a lunch voucher that would buy an airport pre-made airport sandwich. Back after lunch and sched on flight in another hour (now 2.5 hours later). This is very typical or even quite good service for this airline.

Air Canada customer review,Friesen Robert,Not Verified,I am a Star Alliance Gold Card holder and fly business class frequently. I just returned from a trip to Thailand and flew the Vancouver to Hong Kong leg (return) business class in their newly configured 777-300 series aircraft. The new business class seating arrangement on this aircraft is an unmitigated disaster. Where do I begin! It is primarily a 2-2-2 layout with 3 rows being 1-2-1. This single seat is only available to AC super elite members. So AC has decided that any other full fare business class travelers on this aircraft are not entitled to a single seat. Ridiculous. The tight seats are far too firm and narrow footwells make it impossible to properly stretch out and have a relaxing sleep. There is no storage area and materials used are cheap and do not even belong in a Premium Economy section. Window passengers do not have a clear access to the aisle. You have to climb over the other passenger. This is unacceptable in a business class in today's airline industry! I browsed through the Duty Free Magazine located in the seat pocket in front of each seat and asked the Flight Attendant if I could order something. She advised me that the configuration of this aircraft did not permit any duty free sales on board. No duty free on board when there is a duty free magazine located in every seat pocket! I will never fly on this aircraft again and my frequent flights to Asia will be on other Star Alliance carriers which are improving their business class product not reducing it to cattle car status such as AC.,18th September 2014,,Business Class,,,1,3,3,1,0,0,1,[],0,9.0,5,1.8,0.0,0.08911203044267561,"['star', 'alliance', 'gold', 'card', 'holder', 'fly', 'business', 'class', 'frequently', 'returned', 'trip', 'thailand', 'flew', 'hong', 'kong', 'leg', 'return', 'business', 'class', 'newly', 'configured', 'series', 'aircraft', 'new', 'business', 'class', 'seating', 'arrangement', 'aircraft', 'unmitigated', 'disaster', 'begin', 'primarily', 'layout', 'rows', 'single', 'seat', 'available', 'ac', 'super', 'elite', 'members', 'ac', 'decided', 'full', 'fare', 'business', 'class', 'travelers', 'aircraft', 'entitled', 'single', 'seat', 'ridiculous', 'tight', 'seats', 'far', 'firm', 'narrow', 'footwells', 'make', 'impossible', 'properly', 'stretch', 'relaxing', 'sleep', 'storage', 'area', 'materials', 'used', 'cheap', 'belong', 'premium', 'economy', 'section', 'window', 'passengers', 'clear', 'access', 'aisle', 'climb', 'passenger', 'unacceptable', 'business', 'class', 'today', 'airline', 'industry', 'browsed', 'duty', 'free', 'magazine', 'located', 'seat', 'pocket', 'front', 'seat', 'asked', 'attendant', 'order', 'something', 'advised', 'configuration', 'aircraft', 'permit', 'duty', 'free', 'sales', 'board', 'duty', 'free', 'board', 'duty', 'free', 'magazine', 'located', 'every', 'seat', 'pocket', 'never', 'fly', 'aircraft', 'frequent', 'asia', 'star', 'alliance', 'carriers', 'improving', 'business', 'class', 'product', 'reducing', 'cattle', 'car', 'status', 'ac']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Air Canada customer review,Tangye Graeme,Not Verified,We had three short haul domestic flights with Air Canada - YVR to YYJ YYJ to YYC and YYC to YVR. One flight was on time one was 25 minutes late and the other was over an hour late. Minimal information was provided about the delays and most of that was obviously incorrect. Check-in at YYJ and YYC was simple and efficient but at YVR was terribly slow with only 2 bag drop desks open and huge queues.

Air Canada customer review,Tangye Graeme,Not Verified,LHR to YVR 777-300ER. Fairly new aircraft with everything clean and working as it should. Cabin crew were okay without being anything special. I found the staggered beds to be quite comfortable although if travelling alone it is better to avoid the pairs of seats near the window unless you want to climb over/be climbed over by a stranger. Food was okay but nothing special. Air Canada lounge at Heathrow was nice but the check-in process was poor. The premium desk was far removed from the economy kiosks with poor signage and the Air Canada roving ground staff lady that we dealt with did not help. It was only when we reached the bag drop desk after a long wait that we were told where we should have gone.,17th September 2014,,Business Class,,,4,3,3,3,0,0,3,[],0,16.0,5,3.2,0.0,0.20448773448773452,"['lhr', 'yvr', 'fairly', 'new', 'aircraft', 'everything', 'clean', 'working', 'cabin', 'crew', 'okay', 'anything', 'special', 'found', 'staggered', 'beds', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'although', 'travelling', 'alone', 'better', 'avoid', 'pairs', 'seats', 'near', 'window', 'unless', 'want', 'climb', 'climbed', 'stranger', 'food', 'okay', 'nothing', 'special', 'lounge', 'heathrow', 'nice', 'process', 'poor', 'premium', 'desk', 'far', 'removed', 'economy', 'kiosks', 'poor', 'signage', 'roving', 'ground', 'staff', 'lady', 'dealt', 'help', 'reached', 'bag', 'drop', 'desk', 'long', 'wait', 'told', 'gone']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,E Wong,Not Verified,"On September 8 I boarded my connection flight scheduled to depart at 6.30pm from Calgary to London Heathrow but after boarding the pilot announces that there was a problem with the de-icing device. They spent hours trying to fix the problem but in the end the flight was canceled. By the time we walked out of the plane it was almost midnight. I understand that due to safety issues there was no choice but to cancel the flight but what I'm extremely upset about was the unhelpful staff and lack of support for the 300 passengers walking out of that plane at midnight in a snowing city hungry and without anywhere to go. After exiting the plane we were summarily dismissed by agents who could do nothing to help us rebook our plane find hotels or even to just to remove our ""checked-in"" status so that we could call the helpline to rebook our flight. Because the desk agents failed to remove my ""checked-in"" status (when I asked they told me it would be done in about an hour which did not happen) I had to call the help line 3 different times before someone there was able to reach the ticket office to fix things up and issue me a new ticket for next evening. Needless to say it was a sleepless night. As a single Canadian adult traveling by myself with all the right gadgets and adequate travel insurance I was lucky enough to sort everything out myself albeit with endless frustrations. I can only imagine how much worse it would have been for foreigner families or elderly people with hearing problems. Because of this experience I will probably take a vacation from Air Canada for a long long time.",14th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,3,0,0,1,[],0,11.0,5,2.2,0.0,-0.017884199134199134,"['september', 'boarded', 'connection', 'scheduled', 'depart', 'heathrow', 'boarding', 'pilot', 'announces', 'problem', 'device', 'spent', 'hours', 'trying', 'fix', 'problem', 'end', 'canceled', 'time', 'walked', 'plane', 'almost', 'midnight', 'understand', 'due', 'safety', 'issues', 'choice', 'cancel', 'extremely', 'upset', 'unhelpful', 'staff', 'lack', 'support', 'passengers', 'walking', 'plane', 'midnight', 'snowing', 'city', 'hungry', 'anywhere', 'exiting', 'plane', 'summarily', 'dismissed', 'agents', 'nothing', 'help', 'rebook', 'plane', 'find', 'hotels', 'remove', 'status', 'call', 'helpline', 'rebook', 'desk', 'agents', 'failed', 'remove', 'status', 'asked', 'told', 'done', 'hour', 'happen', 'call', 'help', 'line', 'different', 'times', 'someone', 'able', 'reach', 'ticket', 'office', 'fix', 'things', 'issue', 'new', 'ticket', 'evening', 'needless', 'sleepless', 'night', 'single', 'canadian', 'adult', 'traveling', 'right', 'gadgets', 'adequate', 'travel', 'insurance', 'lucky', 'enough', 'sort', 'everything', 'albeit', 'endless', 'frustrations', 'imagine', 'much', 'worse', 'foreigner', 'families', 'elderly', 'people', 'hearing', 'problems', 'experience', 'probably', 'take', 'vacation', 'long', 'long', 'time']","['customer', 'review']",neg
Air Canada customer review,Cohen Jonathan,Not Verified,"Toronto YYZ - Tel-Aviv TLV. Flew on new 787-8 aircraft in a standard economy window seat. The plane has only been in service since the early summer and it shows. It still looks (and smells) new. The climate control system pumped fresh air into the cabin the AC was very good. The windows on this plane are huge. The ambient lighting changed according to our journey's progress and provided a good general atmosphere. The entertainment system was excellent and fast responding with an extended selection of films TV shows games etc. Every seat came with a USB plug as well as AC power. Flight attendants were courteous professional and between them spoke 6 languages to cater to the various passengers. The overhead storage bins were very large. The cabin in general seemed spacious and pleasing. Before I review the seats and leg space please make note that I have small build 5'5"" (165 cm) and 132 pounds (60kg). Leg room was ok as long as you don't have carry on luggage on the floor. The seat reclined to a relative comfortable position (as far as an economy seat may be comfortable) although I didn't note a major improvement over other/older Air Canada planes including the 767-3 which was replaced by this plane on this route. The big problem with the seating in economy is the 3x3x3 configuration. The seats are narrow. I was lucky that nobody was sitting in the middle seat next to my window seat. The seat felt cramped without a person sitting next to me. It would've been almost unbearable to fly for 10 hours with someone next to me. Remember I'm smaller than the average person and couldn't imagine how an average or large person could last in an economy seat for such a long flight. Air Canada definitely dropped the ball with this seat configuration on an international flight. It might work for a short haul flight but not on a 10 hour flight. Simply outrageous design decision. Another inexplicable design decision was to mount controls on the arm rest exactly where you'd put your arm. There were several incidents witnessed during the flight where a passenger accidentally pressed the flight attendant button. The flight attendants reaction was as if it was a common occurrence. I myself accidentally pressed the seat lighting button a few times and changed the volume on my flight entertainment program. This is a very annoying design flaw especially if a stranger sitting next to you will push the buttons on your flight entertainment controls. Food was horrible possibly the worst meal I've come across specifically the main course for dinner as well as breakfast. One bite was more than enough to leave the food on the tray. The new plane has a lot going for it but is plagued by design flaws in economy that would most likely make the long journey in economy a very bad experience for almost every single person. Disappointing! I cannot recommend a flight on this plane in economy. My suggestion would be to pay the extra money to fly in Premium Economy. The seats looked far more comfortable and had had a better 2x3x2 configuration. I also suggest to eat prior to flying at the airport and/or buy food to eat prior to boarding.",14th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,4,1,5,0,0,2,[],0,14.0,5,2.8,0.0,0.05531107406107404,"['yyz', 'tlv', 'flew', 'new', 'aircraft', 'standard', 'economy', 'window', 'seat', 'plane', 'service', 'since', 'early', 'summer', 'shows', 'still', 'looks', 'smells', 'new', 'climate', 'control', 'system', 'pumped', 'fresh', 'cabin', 'ac', 'good', 'windows', 'plane', 'huge', 'ambient', 'lighting', 'changed', 'according', 'journey', 'progress', 'provided', 'good', 'general', 'atmosphere', 'entertainment', 'system', 'excellent', 'fast', 'responding', 'extended', 'selection', 'films', 'tv', 'shows', 'games', 'etc', 'every', 'seat', 'came', 'usb', 'plug', 'well', 'ac', 'power', 'attendants', 'courteous', 'professional', 'spoke', 'languages', 'cater', 'various', 'passengers', 'overhead', 'storage', 'bins', 'large', 'cabin', 'general', 'seemed', 'spacious', 'pleasing', 'review', 'seats', 'leg', 'space', 'please', 'make', 'note', 'small', 'build', 'cm', 'pounds', 'leg', 'room', 'ok', 'long', 'carry', 'luggage', 'floor', 'seat', 'reclined', 'relative', 'comfortable', 'position', 'far', 'economy', 'seat', 'may', 'comfortable', 'although', 'note', 'major', 'improvement', 'planes', 'including', 'replaced', 'plane', 'route', 'big', 'problem', 'seating', 'economy', 'configuration', 'seats', 'narrow', 'lucky', 'nobody', 'sitting', 'middle', 'seat', 'window', 'seat', 'seat', 'felt', 'cramped', 'person', 'sitting', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'fly', 'hours', 'someone', 'remember', 'smaller', 'average', 'person', 'imagine', 'average', 'large', 'person', 'last', 'economy', 'seat', 'long', 'definitely', 'dropped', 'ball', 'seat', 'configuration', 'international', 'might', 'work', 'short', 'haul', 'hour', 'simply', 'outrageous', 'design', 'decision', 'another', 'inexplicable', 'design', 'decision', 'mount', 'controls', 'arm', 'rest', 'exactly', 'put', 'arm', 'several', 'incidents', 'witnessed', 'passenger', 'accidentally', 'pressed', 'attendant', 'button', 'attendants', 'reaction', 'common', 'occurrence', 'accidentally', 'pressed', 'seat', 'lighting', 'button', 'times', 'changed', 'volume', 'entertainment', 'program', 'annoying', 'design', 'flaw', 'especially', 'stranger', 'sitting', 'push', 'buttons', 'entertainment', 'controls', 'food', 'horrible', 'possibly', 'worst', 'meal', 'come', 'across', 'specifically', 'main', 'course', 'dinner', 'well', 'breakfast', 'bite', 'enough', 'leave', 'food', 'tray', 'new', 'plane', 'lot', 'going', 'plagued', 'design', 'flaws', 'economy', 'likely', 'make', 'long', 'journey', 'economy', 'bad', 'experience', 'almost', 'every', 'single', 'person', 'disappointing', 'recommend', 'plane', 'economy', 'suggestion', 'pay', 'extra', 'money', 'fly', 'premium', 'economy', 'seats', 'looked', 'far', 'comfortable', 'better', 'configuration', 'suggest', 'eat', 'prior', 'flying', 'airport', 'buy', 'food', 'eat', 'prior', 'boarding']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Air Canada customer review,Rebecca Dorman,Not Verified,Our family flew from Vancouver to Sydney in Business Class on the final leg of an around the world trip. All other Star Alliance airlines were great. Air Canada was shocking! There were no shower facilities in the Air Canada lounge in Vancouver. The aircraft was very dirty. Crumbs of food smeared sticky stuff old rubbish around our seats. We had ordered special meals due to medical conditions for 3 family members. The food was inedible - overcooked. Our business class meal consisted of chicken that was too hard to cut potatoes that disintegrated as soon as we tried to pick it up with a fork. Dessert was a small fruit salad. We were offered our breakfast instead of our dinner in case that was better and the crew were understanding but there were no other food options available for a 19 hour flight.

All we had to do was contact the AC agents at Montreal. Suffice to say no one was available to help in fact a less helpful bunch of individuals I have yet to meet.

Air Canada customer review,Dela Santa Corazon,Not Verified,Our Air Canada flight to Barcelona August 8 and our return from Madrid August 21 were saddled with cancellations delays and very poor customer service. As the 8.50 flight was getting closer to departure time on the night of August 8 passengers were first told that the aircraft had not arrived while the crew had come in. Then we were told that there was no part and it was best to wait and be safe than sorry. By 10.30 additional staff came in and said that the part had arrived. After an hour of waiting close to midnight we learned there was no crew to fly and the flight was cancelled. The station manager came in with security and more staff. The manager said that all hotels in downtown Montreal were full booked thus no hotel for us. He however guaranteed that we would be flying the next day to Barcelona and that we could retrieve our luggage and AC staff will make sure that we are comfortable. There was not a single staff member around after customs so passengers who decided to sleep in the airport went around looking for benches and chairs to sleep on. Vouchers of course were handed over but in the beginning my sister and I were told of the following: no food will be served on the flight but would be available for purchase no re-routing to catch our tour and AC was not responsible if we missed our tour. All these actions on the part of Air Canada were well orchestrated and any questions from passengers was met with Security ready to handle any raising of voices. Our Air Canada saga however did not end in Barcelona. On the way back August 21 from Madrid again the 1.30 pm flight was moved to 3.00 pm. It was not difficult to figure out again the cause for delay. As more fresh looking passengers came in to join the 3 pm flight it was clear the delay was done to combine the 1 pm and 3 pm passengers. The delay caused us to miss the connecting flight in Toronto for Montreal our final destination. When we asked Air Canada customer service if we could take an earlier flight to Montreal we were told that our luggage had been checked in for the 10.30 flight to Montreal. We could not say anything to customer service only to find out that our luggage did not arrive in Montreal in spite of the nearly 3 hour window to load our luggage. As someone enticed to fly Air Canada's direct flight to Barcelona from Montreal this airline gave its passengers a sing song routine when all passengers like me wanted to know what is really happening with our flights.

Air Canada customer review,Julian Wyer,Not Verified,London Heathrow to Montreal 28 August 2014 Boeing 777-333ER C-FNNW. One of Air Canada's latest Triple Sevens equipped with their latest interior in economy with black leather seats and a very cramped 3-4-3 configuration. Very narrow seats uncomfortable but just OK for a 6.5 hour flight. The controller for the in-flight entertainment screen is now placed in the arm rest just where you lean your elbows causing lights and cabin call alerts all over the cabin. Little thought has been placed into the design of Air Canada's new economy cabin! Also my light control was turning on the incorrect light (obviously little testing of their systems on a new aircraft). Cabin attendants all old-timers and all very miserable but this is consistent with my experience of AC's transatlantic offering. Food - perhaps it is time they quit the hot food service! Still cannot believe this economy cabin design has actually entered service and other airlines that also employ the 3-4-3 configuration on the Triple are far more comfortable.,1st September 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,2,3,4,0,0,5,[],0,16.0,5,3.2,0.0,0.092507215007215,"['heathrow', 'montreal', 'august', 'boeing', 'latest', 'triple', 'sevens', 'equipped', 'latest', 'interior', 'economy', 'black', 'leather', 'seats', 'cramped', 'configuration', 'narrow', 'seats', 'uncomfortable', 'ok', 'hour', 'controller', 'entertainment', 'screen', 'placed', 'arm', 'rest', 'lean', 'elbows', 'causing', 'lights', 'cabin', 'call', 'alerts', 'cabin', 'little', 'thought', 'placed', 'design', 'new', 'economy', 'cabin', 'light', 'control', 'turning', 'incorrect', 'light', 'obviously', 'little', 'testing', 'systems', 'new', 'aircraft', 'cabin', 'attendants', 'miserable', 'consistent', 'experience', 'ac', 'transatlantic', 'offering', 'food', 'perhaps', 'time', 'quit', 'hot', 'food', 'service', 'still', 'believe', 'economy', 'cabin', 'design', 'actually', 'entered', 'service', 'airlines', 'employ', 'configuration', 'triple', 'far', 'comfortable']","['customer', 'review']",pos

A highlight on the GP-Calgary (5.00 flt) - a very friendly and funny FA.

Air Canada customer review,D Yu,Not Verified,HKG-YVR. Each time I take Air Canada between Vancouver and some Asian destination I become increasingly frustrated with half of the staff's attitudes. It seems to me that some of these flight attendants tend to get easily frustrated towards Asian passengers. One flight attendant was lecturing me what I should and should not place in the overhead compartment (I really wish I just ignored her). Another major issue I have with the new seat design is the placement of the earphone plug which is located in front of us. It's extremely inconvenient to unplug it in and out all the time when a passenger next to you has to get up. Plus this is also one of the least comfortable economy seats I have sat on.,1st September 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,3,4,0,0,3,[],0,13.0,5,2.6,0.0,-0.11290792540792541,"['time', 'take', 'asian', 'destination', 'become', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'half', 'staff', 'attitudes', 'seems', 'attendants', 'tend', 'easily', 'frustrated', 'towards', 'asian', 'passengers', 'attendant', 'lecturing', 'place', 'overhead', 'compartment', 'really', 'wish', 'ignored', 'another', 'major', 'issue', 'new', 'seat', 'design', 'placement', 'earphone', 'plug', 'located', 'front', 'extremely', 'inconvenient', 'unplug', 'time', 'passenger', 'plus', 'least', 'comfortable', 'economy', 'seats', 'sat']","['customer', 'review']",neg
Air Canada customer review,Ralph Smith,Not Verified,My original rant today starts because of Air Canada's online flight tracker. Every time one of our friends comes in from out of town we normally follow their progress online to make sure we don't have much of a wait at the airport. Air Canada doesn't seem to care and leave their customer's rides hanging today it was almost an hour. Now my second rant is from personal experience a number of years back and I tell anyone who asks me which airline they should use and shouldn't. I haven't taken a flight myself with Air Canada since we booked a trip using airmiles and never will again. Our flight to Cancun was originally set for 32 hours 5 stop overs and leaving from an airport an hour and a half away. A few days later I received a call from them to change my itinerary to 26 hours when I asked if they could let me use the airport 10 minutes from my home he said since we put you through the trouble OK. Sleeping in my wheelchair inside of the Mexico City and Guadalajara airport we arrived in Cancun utterly exhausted and me with a diabetic low blood sugar. On the 6 hour flight home with an overnight in Calgary my wife left me ahead to grab our luggage. When they came to get me I told them my supplies were all in the overhead compartment. The rude stewardess wouldn't even look and told me that my wife had everything. I get off of the plane and when I saw my wife she didn't have my jacket medical supplies or test kit. After spending the night trying to retrieve my medical supplies in the city we went home exhausted again. They had the nerve the next day to tell me to come and get my supplies. After them making 3 trips I finally got everything back. Even if I was offered a few flight I will never board another Air Canada plane ever again.,28th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,3,0,0,1,[],0,11.0,5,2.2,0.0,0.009722222222222217,"['original', 'rant', 'today', 'starts', 'online', 'tracker', 'every', 'time', 'friends', 'comes', 'town', 'normally', 'follow', 'progress', 'online', 'make', 'sure', 'much', 'wait', 'airport', 'seem', 'care', 'leave', 'customer', 'rides', 'hanging', 'today', 'almost', 'hour', 'second', 'rant', 'personal', 'experience', 'number', 'years', 'back', 'tell', 'anyone', 'asks', 'airline', 'use', 'taken', 'since', 'booked', 'trip', 'using', 'airmiles', 'never', 'cancun', 'originally', 'set', 'hours', 'stop', 'overs', 'leaving', 'airport', 'hour', 'half', 'away', 'days', 'later', 'received', 'call', 'change', 'itinerary', 'hours', 'asked', 'let', 'use', 'airport', 'minutes', 'home', 'since', 'put', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'wheelchair', 'inside', 'mexico', 'city', 'guadalajara', 'airport', 'arrived', 'cancun', 'utterly', 'exhausted', 'diabetic', 'low', 'blood', 'sugar', 'hour', 'home', 'overnight', 'wife', 'left', 'ahead', 'grab', 'luggage', 'came', 'told', 'supplies', 'overhead', 'compartment', 'rude', 'stewardess', 'look', 'told', 'wife', 'everything', 'plane', 'saw', 'wife', 'jacket', 'medical', 'supplies', 'test', 'kit', 'spending', 'night', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'medical', 'supplies', 'city', 'home', 'exhausted', 'nerve', 'day', 'tell', 'come', 'supplies', 'making', 'trips', 'finally', 'everything', 'back', 'offered', 'never', 'board', 'another', 'plane', 'ever']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Jeff Russell,Not Verified,YYC to Narita return: Horrible flight there. Checked in for my wife and I with seats together the night before. Somehow when we showed up at the airport the seats were separated. Managed to change 1 seat with a nice Japanese lady. Both inflight entertainment systems did not work. About 50% of the cabin had the same issues. How hard is it to test the system beforehand? Or upgrade to a system that works. On the way to Narita we were both stuck with the Japanese meal being at the back of the plane. Was awful. On the return flight back we managed to get seats in the front of the plane and had a much better meal. Still 1 out of 2 inflight systems did not work properly only a couple of movies worked.

Flight was late and arrived in YYZ with 30 minutes to clear customs grab bags drop off bags at domestic go through security and get to gate. No Air Canada representative anywhere in this process to assist in getting through quickly so we missed our flight. The counter clerk insinuated we should have asked for help. I asked the Baggage Clerk the Information Clerk the Customs Clerk and the Security Clerk. There was no Air Canada representative present anywhere during this process.

Air Canada customer review,John Smith,Not Verified,YVR-LHR on the high density 777. Will avoid this aircraft in the future. Seats were filthy when we got on the plane with garbage shoved under the seat and in the pockets. Not acceptable for business class. Service was poor and staff constantly running around frantically. No water runs no one came to collect garbage and there was no snack bar unlike other 777 flights. Food was mediocre at best. One positive about the 777HD is that the IFE is excellent and the TV screen is much larger.

Air Canada customer review,R Lowry,Not Verified,Air Canada Express (Jazz) YYZ - Charlottetown PEI - YYZ August 12-19. Given the strong and well deserved criticism levelled at Air Canada's bizarre Rouge offering I want to compliment those in charge and working in their Express service. Our flights to Charlottetown and back were on time professionally operated with a calm atmosphere completely absent the tension that exists on so many stressful jammed-in flights. The CRJ 705 to PEI was very comfortable you could cross an ocean in those seats no problem. The smaller CRJ 200 on the way back is more snug with a couple of inches less leg room but still adequate for the flight length. The CRJ 200 lacks the entertainment system and catering of the 705 that is the only thing removing some stars from my overall rating. Now that I will not book an Air Canada flight that could be Rouged at a later date it is good to know that there are some services under the Air Canada brand that one can take with a confident expectation of good service and a pleasant flight.

Air Canada customer review,Richard Lau,Not Verified,I will definitely not fly with Air Canada again. Had a previous bad experience with them and thought maybe give them another chance. Wife and I flew out of Paris from CDG. Boarded aircraft along with other 398 passengers and waited for over an hour for the plane to depart. No apologies nor explanations other than a brief P.A. about waiting for one late baggage. Plane arrived at Montreal one hour late and all passengers were not allowed to disembark due to some medical problem with one single person with another further delay of 20 minutes or so. We rushed to baggage claim to retrieve the check-ins then to an Air Canada connections kiosk. The clerk was extremely slow and seemed unsure how to process the transfer and became irritated when told that we were in a hurry to catch the 4 pm connector in 45 mins. She eventually told us that she would be placing us on a 8 pm connector instead. She became even more irate when asked for an explanation and merely told us to move on and just place the luggage on the conveyor. Another agent then came over and demanded us not to place the luggage on the conveyor as the flight was not until 8 pm and we were required to lug them around until further notice. While waiting for the connector - we spoke with a supervisor at an Air Can ticket counter and she explained that all passengers must be checked in 1 hour to departure hence we were placed on an 8 pm connector.

Air Canada customer review,J Taylor,Not Verified,LHR to Calgary: Check in at brand new T2 was a complete shambles - not sure if this is AC's problem or T2 teething troubles? Not enough staff around to deal with self check-in problems and only 2 check in desks available - the queue was long and slow! On board in Economy seat pitch and leg room was pretty good for 2 adults and 1 child. Everything else distinctly average. Return leg Vancouver to LHR Premium Economy: Self check in worked fine but bag drop slow and everyone in the same queue with not one AC rep on the airport floor in sight. Seats in Premium OK. Flight delayed for around an hour due to them being unable to get the door closed. Inflight service really poor - food was absolutely dire and meal of choice had run out even before we'd left the ground. Flight attendants completely lacking in attentiveness - no rubbish collection despite me having a nice tidy little bag full of bits which I deliberately left in sight. Even as we came in to land it got missed on their final cabin check. Missed drinks/coffee runs - there was definitely a preferred customer system in operation - fine we may not be frequent flyer members (and never will be!) but we've still paid a premium fare and shouldn't be completely overlooked. Baggage reclaim at LHR T2 a mess - again not sure if this is AC's problem but surely LHR should know what they're doing by now? All in all both Air Canada and LHR's shiny new T2 have disappointed. Not sure we'll be able to avoid using T2 again in the future but certainly we will not be choosing AC again.,18th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,2,0,0,2,[],0,9.0,5,1.8,0.0,0.06055722732552001,"['lhr', 'check', 'brand', 'new', 'complete', 'shambles', 'sure', 'ac', 'problem', 'teething', 'troubles', 'enough', 'staff', 'around', 'deal', 'self', 'problems', 'check', 'desks', 'available', 'queue', 'long', 'slow', 'board', 'economy', 'seat', 'pitch', 'leg', 'room', 'pretty', 'good', 'adults', 'child', 'everything', 'else', 'distinctly', 'average', 'return', 'leg', 'lhr', 'premium', 'economy', 'self', 'check', 'worked', 'fine', 'bag', 'drop', 'slow', 'everyone', 'queue', 'ac', 'rep', 'airport', 'floor', 'sight', 'seats', 'premium', 'ok', 'delayed', 'around', 'hour', 'due', 'unable', 'door', 'closed', 'inflight', 'service', 'really', 'poor', 'food', 'absolutely', 'dire', 'meal', 'choice', 'run', 'left', 'ground', 'attendants', 'completely', 'lacking', 'attentiveness', 'rubbish', 'collection', 'despite', 'nice', 'tidy', 'little', 'bag', 'full', 'bits', 'deliberately', 'left', 'sight', 'came', 'land', 'missed', 'final', 'cabin', 'check', 'missed', 'runs', 'definitely', 'preferred', 'customer', 'system', 'operation', 'fine', 'may', 'frequent', 'flyer', 'members', 'never', 'still', 'paid', 'premium', 'fare', 'completely', 'overlooked', 'baggage', 'reclaim', 'lhr', 'mess', 'sure', 'ac', 'problem', 'surely', 'lhr', 'know', 'lhr', 'shiny', 'new', 'disappointed', 'sure', 'able', 'avoid', 'using', 'future', 'certainly', 'choosing', 'ac']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Air Canada customer review,Radda Stephan,Not Verified,"We bought a ticket for Vienna - Toronto - Orlando and back Miami -–Toronto - Vienna online and got tickets for flights AC6167 AC1866 AC917 AC 6166. The first problem was we could not reserve seats for the Vienna-Toronto flight because it was operated by Austrian Airlines. We checked in online at the first opportunity and had an uneventful trip to Miami the Air Canada Plane being a little rugged was an ""Air Rouge"" flight but it was ok. The return flight was a disaster. The Plane from Miami arrived late from Toronto which resulted in missing the Vienna flight. We asked the onboard personnel if they could give us any information on the status of our connecting flight but the same problem again: they told us they had no info on the Austrian Airlines flight and that it was ""out of their hands"" - then they got annoyed when we asked for priority disembarking. Well we ran for it but it had not waited for our party of 8. We were split up re-routed to Paris AC880 and then after 5 hours of waiting to Vienna by Air France flight AF1738. We had to get the Air France boarding passes ourselves offered no assistance like food vouchers or lounge access but told us we could fill out a complaint form online. We had to run around so much (with 2 little children) that we used 3 hours up anyway. When we arrived finally in Vienna the luggage was missing again some confusion which Airline was responsible now.

Air Canada customer review,S Bradley,Not Verified,I will not fly on Air Canada if I can help it. My wife and I won tickets to fly anywhere in Canada in a contest (not through AC). We decided on St. John's NFLD. Somehow the ticket agents and boarding staff knew that we didn't pay for our tickets and from that point on the service ended. The man at the boarding desk actually said to me that I had no right to request better seats (the plane was only half full) because we didn't pay for our tickets. I was appalled at the rudeness we experience and will not fly on an airline that pays employees to treat people like this. We usually go to the border cities to fly out of to save money.

Air Canada customer review,Jonathan Nesbitt,Not Verified,"August 2nd 2014 AC009. We arrived at a very crowded very unruly check in counter in Calgary where it was clear staff had no control of the lineup. When you're travelling with a 5 month old this situation can create a lot of stress. Once we boarded the situation became worse. The seats were dirty and clearly very worn. It was evident that the planes climate control was broken. We sat onboard the aircraft at the gate for what seemed to be a very long time with aircraft engineers trying to fix the problem. The pilot claimed the problem was fixed we began our taxi away from the gate and then the plane just sat there. We went back to the gate and tried to get it fixed. After a lengthy wait (again) we taxied and took off. Of course once airborne the cooling system still did not work and the pilot informed us that we were going to be diverted to Vancouver to potentially switch planes. Told a new plane was being readied and we would be boarding 7pm Vancouver time. When we went to our new check in gate the situation went from worse to downright awful. Ground staff had no idea on seat assignments and couldn't figure out where to seat everyone. We thankfully got our bassinet seats but other passengers were told to board and to find a seat ""anywhere they could"". We finally got in the air 9 hours after our ordeal.

Seats were similar to AC domestic standard business class about 38' or more pitch two on the sides. The dinner meal was a condensed business class meal in my opinion having travelled in that class previously. The wine drinks service was excellent staff were very attentive. Morning meal more standard fare but fine. Air Canada has come a long way in service over the past few years and I would definitely choose them over any American carrier and many European ones.

Air Canada customer review,T Eldem,Not Verified,AC 811 from IST to YYZ on B767-300. The ground services in Istanbul are handled by a third party for Air Canada and are appalling. I am a top-tier AC frequent flyer and used the priority check-in which took an extraordinarily long time to process our party of 4 travellers. There were 5 agents behind the desk with only one dealing with the passengers and the rest simply watching. Boarding process was utterly chaotic with 9 agents in attendance and none of them at all interested in answering the queries from the passengers or helping them. I had to inquire 3 times about priority boarding before I was offered a snippy response. In one of those instances the agent made eye-contact and then simply walked away from me completely ignoring my question. The gate assigned for the flight was woefully inadequate to handle a Transatlantic flight. 200+ passengers were processed through a check-in facility more suited for commuter planes. We were eventually bussed to the aircraft adding further delays to a flight that was already delayed by 90 minutes. Once onboard the aircraft showed its age with tired interior worn-out PODS inoperable washrooms and dull lighting. FA's were very attentive and the AVOD selection offered plenty of options. Two meals and frequent water-runs were offered throughout the 11-hour long flight. The meals were mediocre at best but drink selection was good. The only redeeming aspect of the journey was the amazing Business Lounge operated by Turkish Airlines. The flight arrived late but we were lucky to make our connection.

Air Canada customer review,Nicola Origgi,Not Verified,Mexico City-Toronto-Milan Malpensa round trip in business class. Air Canada delivers a consistent and sound business class product with some features that make it more similar to a first class product. For example the seat configuration on the 767 (1-1-1) is really comfortable and give a great degree of privacy that is not provided on other 4* airlines. Staff service very attentive. I had a 12 hours layover in Toronto and Air Canada provided me a room free of charge at the Gateway Sheraton: a detail that was very much appreciated.

Air Canada customer review,M Smith,Not Verified,I flew from Toronto to Sydney Australia via Vancouver. The flight was very comfortable. Sure the seat could have been roomier but there was adequate leg room. The leg from Toronto to Vancouver was great no one in the middle seat! And because I was continuing on to Sydney I got free food (a choice of a meal item and a snack). The food on the long haul leg was okay nothing special but edible for myself. Free bar service is nice! Service was good and water was plentiful. I think Air Canada's seat back TV is best in class. Lots to choose from when you can't sleep!

The sum of the meals were carbohydrate heavy. For snacks we were offered pretzels and later some kind of shortbread-like cookie. The snack on the return trip included a roast beef sandwich which had nothing but white bread and roast beef (no lettuce no dressing nothing!). Oh yes one of the other snacks was cup o'noodles. For main meal one of the dishes was some kind of white pasta pellets with a little bit of chicken. Another main meal was white congee (i.e. white rice porridge) or egg. So again carbs carbs carbs!

Air Canada customer review,Thiessen Gerald,Not Verified,Winnipeg to Nashville via Toronto. Was scheduled to fly Sunday morning. Plane was delayed due to mechanical problems things like this happen. The problem was we were not informed that our flight was delayed while standing in the line. The board showed our flight to be on time. Needless to say we stood for over 2 hours in line and were late to board our plane. Then told our plane was delayed. No help was offered while we were in the line only told we would have to wait our turn. Ended up flying into Toronto later that day but missed our connecting flight to Nashville. Thankfully Air Canada paid for our hotel and part of our supper in Toronto. On our return we were on schedule coming into Toronto according to our tickets. But when we had gone through customs and were ready recheck our bags to get the connecting flight to Winnipeg we were told we were too late as the baggage had to be checked in 1 hour in advance of the next flight. No effort to get us on the original flight. Thankfully I had enough time after landing in Winnipeg that I could still drive home. The service we got at the airports was just appalling.

Air Canada customer review,K Gelderen,Not Verified,We flew from Frankfurt to Calgary and 3 weeks later again from Vancouver to London. Our first trip was a bit hectic because we had very little time to catch our connecting flight. We had to run to our gate and once arrived there was a big queue. We were assigned 2 seats apart from each other (15 rows in between) so despite the big queue we went to the Air Canada desk at the gate to ask if it was possible to change our seats. The lady was friendly and she did manage to change our seats on this very short notice so that was positive. During the flight the food was good you could choose from different soft drinks (cans not just a glass) and the flight attendants came by with water quite often. The inflight entertainment was good as well (touchscreen). On the returning flight we had a newer airplane but the experience was not as good. The seat configuration was different as they added an extra row of seats which made 3-4-3. Because of this the seats were very small and less comfortable. Also the food was quite bad and the flight attendants were not as friendly and less skilled. The inflight entertainment system however was even better (latest version) so no complaints about that at all. Overall impression of flying with Air Canada was good.

Air Canada customer review,P Smith,Not Verified,YYZ-LHR-YYZ. Outbound flight on new 787. Return on 777-300. The new planes are a very welcome addition and a solid improvement over the dated 767. AC has reconfigured the business class pods for the 787 so they point towards the window instead of away. TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment. AC's switch from T3 to T2 is a good move as the terminal is much nicer and easier to get through security although the walk to the Heathrow Express is a long one.,11th July 2014,,Business Class,,,5,4,2,3,0,0,3,[],0,17.0,5,3.4,0.0,0.18630421865715985,"['outbound', 'new', 'return', 'new', 'planes', 'welcome', 'addition', 'solid', 'improvement', 'dated', 'ac', 'reconfigured', 'business', 'class', 'pods', 'point', 'towards', 'window', 'instead', 'away', 'tv', 'screens', 'much', 'larger', 'table', 'trays', 'better', 'located', 'actually', 'places', 'put', 'belongings', 'tough', 'find', 'fault', 'need', 'sooner', 'service', 'better', 'usual', 'ac', 'inconsistent', 'food', 'quality', 'poor', 'business', 'class', 'ife', 'getting', 'better', 'still', 'needs', 'investment', 'ac', 'switch', 'good', 'move', 'terminal', 'much', 'nicer', 'easier', 'security', 'although', 'walk', 'heathrow', 'express', 'long']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Michelle St-Germain,Not Verified,"I had booked a trip from Ottawa to San Diego with United Airlines. The flight I had to Chicago from Ottawa got cancelled due to weather conditions and I accepted an alternate route through Air Canada which I regret doing. The airplane sat on the YOW tarmac for over an hour and the flight attendants could only say that it was because there was lightening storms in Toronto. Only good thing I can say is that they turned off the engine and allowed us to get out of our seats while we waited. On my way off the plane in TOR no one was able to provide assistance on how to ensure I could make my connecting flight to San Diego which was showing ""on time"" on the flight board. After passing customs baggage check etc. the flight was no longer showing on the flight board. The AC flight attendants I found roaming around had no clue where to direct me. I happen to find the service desk and was told to get in line even though I said my flight was leaving in 10 minutes and I simply needed the gate number. As there were 4 people in line my flight had left by the time I received ""service"". So booking another flight to get to San Diego I opted for a layover in Los Angeles that night instead of waiting another 24 hours in Toronto. I was not offered any compensation for either spending the night in Toronto nor Los Angeles even though Air Canada caused me to miss my flight. Staff member told me he could not give me the boarding pass for the next days flight but omitted to say he did not complete the booking and that I was expected to go to the AC ticket counter at LAX to get one. I only got the customer service contact information when I returned to the desk to confirm my flight to San Diego was in fact the next morning at 9.55. After a short night in a close by hotel I returned to the LAX airport the next morning. I went to US airlines who had no trace of my info who redirected me to American Airlines I found out that there was no ticket for me as the booking the TO agent did not complete the booking. The agent in Toronto said he could do nothing for me because the notes on file said I had accepted LAX as my final destination. Told I needed to speak with a ticket agent at LAX to see what they could do for me. I walked from American Eagle terminal 4 to Air Canada terminal 2 and back. I barely made the 11.30 flight.

Air Canada customer review,T Eldem,Not Verified,LHR to YUL on Boeing 777. Following a somewhat chaotic boarding process driven by the awkward queuing arrangement at the new Terminal #2 boarded the plane only to sit on board for nearly 50 minutes awaiting ATC clearance for takeoff. Once in the air the service was prompt with very attentive FA's. Meal and drink selections were good but the main course I chose lacked flavour. Good inflight AVOD with decent selection of movies and entertainment. Pre-arrival snack was mediocre at best. Despite a late departure the crew was able to make up most of the lost time achieving an almost on schedule arrival. Overall it was a pleasant experience but I must say the new staggered seat configuration in business class is a significant downgrade from the pods. Seat controls are in the arm rest resulting in frequent accidental activation. In lie-flat position one's feet have to fit into a very small space which is very uncomfortable. Swiss utilizes the same seats but provides more leg/foot room. The table is difficult to operate and even the FA's struggle with it. I have been a top-tier loyal customer of AC but if they choose to convert all of their long-haul business class to this seating configuration I will look for alternatives in a hurry.,8th July 2014,,Business Class,,,1,4,3,3,0,0,3,[],0,14.0,5,2.8,0.0,0.15528619528619528,"['lhr', 'yul', 'boeing', 'following', 'somewhat', 'chaotic', 'boarding', 'process', 'driven', 'awkward', 'queuing', 'arrangement', 'new', 'terminal', 'boarded', 'plane', 'sit', 'board', 'nearly', 'minutes', 'awaiting', 'atc', 'clearance', 'takeoff', 'service', 'prompt', 'attentive', 'fa', 'meal', 'drink', 'selections', 'good', 'main', 'course', 'chose', 'lacked', 'flavour', 'good', 'inflight', 'avod', 'decent', 'selection', 'movies', 'entertainment', 'snack', 'mediocre', 'best', 'despite', 'late', 'departure', 'crew', 'able', 'make', 'lost', 'time', 'achieving', 'almost', 'schedule', 'arrival', 'overall', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'must', 'new', 'staggered', 'seat', 'configuration', 'business', 'class', 'significant', 'downgrade', 'pods', 'seat', 'controls', 'arm', 'rest', 'resulting', 'frequent', 'accidental', 'activation', 'position', 'feet', 'fit', 'small', 'space', 'uncomfortable', 'swiss', 'utilizes', 'seats', 'provides', 'room', 'table', 'difficult', 'operate', 'fa', 'struggle', 'loyal', 'customer', 'ac', 'choose', 'convert', 'business', 'class', 'seating', 'configuration', 'look', 'alternatives', 'hurry']","['customer', 'review']",pos

As I was leaving the Vancouver immigration and customs hall personnel of the Canadian Border Services Agency directed me to the wrong exit. Hence instead of going through a dedicated security line for passengers connecting to domestic flights I found myself in the main airport arrivals area bringing all my checked baggage with me even though it was tagged to Victoria my final destination. I asked an AC staff member driving an electric cart whether there was somewhere to drop my checked baggage or whether I should head for the domestic check-in queues. The airport wasn't busy she confirmed that my baggage was already tagged to my final destination and she had no passengers in her cart; so she took me directly to a separate counter (with its own conveyor belt) used for wheelchair passengers accepted my already-checked bag and issued my boarding card.

Air Canada customer review,D Joseph,Not Verified,I've been a status flyer with AC for decades and look forward to the day when other airlines are allowed to compete in Canada for AC routes. Recent changes to Air Canada's 'reward' system mean it is much more difficult and expensive to achieve and retain status. I often fly YYC-NRT on AC010. Formerly Tango Plus fares were full status points at a reasonable price and upgradable. This has now changed the 'low cost' Tango fare usually gives you a ticket at a higher price with only 25% of the status points of the former fare and is not upgradable. Customers seeking an upgradable fare must instead book Flex which is a substantially higher price (35-45% higher). Additionally Air Canada will now bill you an extra $750 per leg to book the upgrade. My experience on June 8th was this. Pay extra for a Flex fare in order to upgrade. Upgrade not available so I've paid extra $350 for the Flex fare to sit in a lower priced economy seat available at a cheaper price. An out and out rip-off.

Air Canada customer review,David Tebbutt,Not Verified,"Very poor quality service for Canada's ""National"" carrier. My wife and I travelled economy class Heathrow-Toronto on 9/6/2014 Vancouver-Anchorage on 16/6/2014 (admittedly this route is now down-graded to their low-cistern carrier Air Canada Rouge) and finally Vancouver-Heathrow on 25/6/2014. No problem with aircraft but cabin crew appeared insufficiently trained in a number of aspects incl. seat and window-blind positions for landing. Quality of food was appalling especially the vegetarian option my wife had pre booked and which was served 20-30 minutes before main service -she had finished what little she could eat before mine had arrived!

Air Canada customer review,K Lockie,Not Verified,Cabin crew were ok. Ground crew were overwhelmed and just didn't care what happened. Connections agent did not use any information system to inform us that our flight in 20 minutes had already departed. In fact our connection had been delayed 45 mins giving us adequate time to get to the gate. The connections agent directed us to stand on line for flight rebooking and for hotel accommodation.

Air Canada customer review,D Collard,Not Verified,Victoria to Vancouver 4 June 2014 a 20-minute flight aboard a new Dash8-Q400 connecting to Lufthansa. The Dash8 series has never been able to accommodate a full-sized carry-on bag in the passenger cabin either in the overhead bin or under the seat in front. As a solution AC has accepted full-sized carry-on bags aboard the Dash8-100 - 200 and -300 models by having passengers place their bags on a cart beside the airstairs when boarding placed them in the baggage compartment as the last bags by the compartment door and then put those bags on another cart at the foot of the airstairs for passengers to collect upon arrival. With its new Dash8-Q400s Air Canada cannot do this but it only announced that fact at the gate at Victoria telling passengers that their full-sized carry- ons would be taken only as checked baggage to their final destination. Passengers were forced to take out from their carry-ons all the items essential to keep with them during their entire trip (laptops prescription medications anything breakable or valuable). My own carry-on is only two-thirds the standard full size and (just barely) fits under the seat in front so I was able to keep it in my possession for my entire 16-hour journey. Travellers should avoid AC flights served by Dash8-Q400 aircraft unless they use smaller carry-on bags not the standard full-sized ones.

Air Canada customer review,J Edward,Not Verified,LHR to Toronto. Although I had originally seen a suitable flight schedule with Air Canada my travel agent organised for me to fly with Lufthansa as she said they were a more reputable airline. Turned out it was code share with Air Canada meaning no access to meal choice no seat selection and subsequently general anxiety about the booking. I got to the airport 3 hours before each time. At Heathrow I was patronised at the counter with 'everyone knows that showing up early does nothing anymore'. I was given a seat in the last row of the plane that only reclined slightly. No problem I am an experienced traveller and although I was on the way to give one of the most important presentations of my life I was able to relax and keep calm. At Toronto airport checking in for the Heathrow flight I had to queue a very long time and then was told there was no assigned seat for me. I went to Lufthansa to see if there was anything they could do for me. I asked why I could not check in online. They told me because the code was a Lufthansa code not recognised by Air Canada. They then told me that because I had bought a significantly cheaper fare (I hadn't) that I should expect to be treated like this. I did however notice that my class was Y which is usually on my boarding pass when I travel economy. Finally 30 minutes before the flight they called my name and had assigned my seat in the last row of the aircraft where I could not recline. This was the overnight flight from Toronto to Heathrow and I had to go back to work the next day. I was offered a choice of two meat based meals and had to refuse them as I am vegetarian. No seat choice no meal choice. My advice is to give code share a miss. Lufthansa and Air Canada may well be partners but when you travel Air Canada as a Lufthansa customer you are bottom rung nobody who somehow deserves to be patronised by all.,1st July 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,2,0,0,2,[],0,16.0,5,3.2,0.0,0.25083333333333335,"['lhr', 'although', 'originally', 'seen', 'suitable', 'schedule', 'travel', 'agent', 'organised', 'fly', 'lufthansa', 'reputable', 'airline', 'turned', 'code', 'share', 'meaning', 'access', 'meal', 'choice', 'seat', 'selection', 'subsequently', 'general', 'anxiety', 'booking', 'airport', 'hours', 'time', 'heathrow', 'patronised', 'counter', 'knows', 'showing', 'early', 'nothing', 'anymore', 'given', 'seat', 'last', 'row', 'plane', 'reclined', 'slightly', 'problem', 'experienced', 'traveller', 'although', 'way', 'give', 'important', 'presentations', 'life', 'able', 'relax', 'keep', 'calm', 'airport', 'checking', 'heathrow', 'queue', 'long', 'time', 'told', 'assigned', 'seat', 'lufthansa', 'see', 'anything', 'asked', 'check', 'online', 'told', 'code', 'lufthansa', 'code', 'recognised', 'told', 'bought', 'significantly', 'cheaper', 'fare', 'expect', 'treated', 'like', 'notice', 'class', 'usually', 'boarding', 'pass', 'travel', 'economy', 'finally', 'minutes', 'called', 'name', 'assigned', 'seat', 'last', 'row', 'aircraft', 'recline', 'overnight', 'heathrow', 'back', 'work', 'day', 'offered', 'choice', 'meat', 'based', 'meals', 'refuse', 'vegetarian', 'seat', 'choice', 'meal', 'choice', 'advice', 'give', 'code', 'share', 'miss', 'lufthansa', 'may', 'well', 'partners', 'travel', 'lufthansa', 'customer', 'bottom', 'rung', 'nobody', 'somehow', 'deserves', 'patronised']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Air Canada customer review,Pettifer Tim,Not Verified,"Air Canada - Canada's discount airline! I fly 100+ flights on Air Canada every year and have done so for 10 yrs. It's sad to see the decline of our national carrier in recent years. Operations at most US stations are now run by outsourced contractors who poorly represent the airline and generally have no interest in providing customer service. Air Canada has relocated many of its US gates from main terminals with good services and lounge options to 2nd tier facilities serving discount or charter carriers. The mainline now operates very few flights in North America subcontracting most flights to Jazz Sky Regional and now ""Rouge"". The product has become so inconsistent that unless one flies AC very regularly it would be almost impossible to now what to expect when you book a flight. Hint - avoid Rouge like the plague! To offer Rouge as a low cost / low service alternative is fine - to discontinue mainline service and replace it with Rouge is not fine!

Crew made sure everything stayed warm until I was ready to eat. The food was great for 35000ft up. Bar service always great never have to worry about not having anything to drink.

Unfortunately the plane that day was out of potable water (only bottled water) hence no hot beverages or cup noodles could be served - disappointment.

Everything else about it is uncomfortable from being scrunched into the corner to no window to tray table and TV being in the side of the seat thus narrowing it. Armrests do not lift. It is by the galley and the washrooms so lots of traffic. Staff were indifferent rushed and not overly friendly. Food was the usual economy stodge loads of carbs not much else. I had the chicken which comprised a dried out 2 inch piece of chicken instant mashed potato and 2 tiny broccoli florets so overcooked as to be almost unrecognizable. Dinner tray included a rock hard roll no butter and unidentifiable salad offering. I used to think no airline could be worse than Air Transat but have now found a worthy replacement.,17th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,[],0,5.0,5,1.0,0.0,-0.21555555555555556,"['ac', 'lhr', 'yyz', 'june', 'seat', 'pay', 'extra', 'seat', 'terrible', 'seat', 'benefit', 'legroom', 'everything', 'else', 'uncomfortable', 'scrunched', 'corner', 'window', 'tray', 'table', 'tv', 'side', 'seat', 'thus', 'narrowing', 'armrests', 'lift', 'galley', 'washrooms', 'lots', 'traffic', 'staff', 'indifferent', 'rushed', 'overly', 'friendly', 'food', 'usual', 'economy', 'stodge', 'loads', 'carbs', 'much', 'else', 'chicken', 'comprised', 'dried', 'inch', 'piece', 'chicken', 'instant', 'mashed', 'potato', 'tiny', 'broccoli', 'florets', 'overcooked', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'dinner', 'tray', 'included', 'rock', 'hard', 'roll', 'butter', 'unidentifiable', 'salad', 'offering', 'used', 'think', 'airline', 'worse', 'transat', 'found', 'worthy', 'replacement']","['customer', 'review']",neg

Air Canada customer review,W Woon,Not Verified,NRT-YYZ on 77W (2-class i.e. older) AC2 on 31 May. It was a full flight I wanted to change my seat from the rear but I couldn't. Thought that AC deserved a little more credit amidst all the negative reviews on Skytrax which did scare me a little. I guess in general where delays or problems don't occur AC probably performs fine. Staff service was pleasant (occasionally a little less friendly). Food was surprisingly better than I expected: food looked and tasted decent (maybe it's catering from NRT) we were rather well-fed (2 meals + instant noodles) drink runs conducted regularly. Seat comfort was alright: standard fare comparable to other airlines cant really complain especially when their new 77W product seems so much worse. Quibbles arise from the in-flight entertainment: mine worked fine but the volume or sound system was not good - volume was at maximum but sound was still terribly muffled (I could only hear half of the conversation while watching movies making movies with heavy narration un-watchable). Other quibbles include the (at least 20 minutes) delays on departure and the very shaky ride we had due to turbulence - I suspect my seated at the rear of the plane meant more shaking. Overall I guess there has to be a reason why they're a Skytrax 4-star airline and winner of Best Airline in North America for 4 years in a row?

Air Canada customer review,Kowal Zdzislaw,Not Verified,We booked our flights 7 months ahead of our trip and were rescheduled 3 times by the time we flew. Left Winnipeg late on flight AC 270 and arrived late in Toronto. Staff onboard were great and they asked everybody to wait in their seats until passengers needing to catch connecting flights were off the plane. That is exactly what happened and we and some other passengers were off the plane proceeding quickly to a gate where we were supposed to board AC 876. The connecting plane was still there yet we and some other passengers (10 in total) were not allowed to board.

Air Canada customer review,J Khan,Not Verified,I booked on Air Canada in January. They sent me a revised itinerary in March. They then sent another revised itinerary in Late April just before my flight. I checked the time and saw that the seats I had reserved and paid for were correct. I ended up being rebooked by Air Canada on Rouge. It was horrible. There was no legroom. You can't recline the seat more than an inch. There was an entertainment system that required you to have your own tablet but when you went to the app there were no first rum movies. My initial flight was on a different type of plane so my original seats didn't match up and my husband and I had someone sitting between us. When I complained to Air Canada I was told that they can bump people to a lower class ticket than you purchased and they hoped to see me soon on another Air Canada flight.

Air Canada customer review,C Shannon,Not Verified,My partner and I have had sporadic good/bad service with Air Canada in the past and until this year I have been fairly neutral about them. However my partners continued poor service through Air Canada for his work trips since February has made me rethink my opinion on them. He has had multiple flights with AC from Toronto to Newark Intl for work and it seems over the last 4 months the service has continued to degrade. AC has continued to overbook flights. On top of overbooking every flight seems to range between late and very late. This level of tardiness could be explained away in February as bad weather but now with not even a cloud in the sky the excuse has gone to continual maintenance issues. As I type this my partner is still sitting in his now 4 hour delay with no explanation why the crew can't seem to get the plane off the ground. I understand things happen sometimes but the way problems are handled is clearly an issue this airline needs to work on. Not all of our service has been bad but all of the recent service has been rather poor. The additional seat area with more legroom is a very nice option for customers and the little TV screens offering movies and music are also very welcome and help with longer flights. However food options are questionable and as I mentioned tardiness and rude attending staff at the terminals coupled with recent check-in issues (like not being able to print boarding passes online) really sour the service.,9th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,4,0,0,1,[],0,11.0,5,2.2,0.0,-0.01076086956521738,"['partner', 'sporadic', 'service', 'past', 'year', 'fairly', 'neutral', 'partners', 'continued', 'poor', 'service', 'work', 'trips', 'since', 'february', 'rethink', 'opinion', 'multiple', 'ac', 'intl', 'work', 'seems', 'last', 'months', 'service', 'continued', 'degrade', 'ac', 'continued', 'overbook', 'top', 'overbooking', 'every', 'seems', 'range', 'late', 'late', 'level', 'tardiness', 'explained', 'away', 'february', 'bad', 'weather', 'cloud', 'sky', 'excuse', 'gone', 'continual', 'maintenance', 'issues', 'type', 'partner', 'still', 'sitting', 'hour', 'delay', 'explanation', 'crew', 'ca', 'seem', 'plane', 'ground', 'understand', 'things', 'happen', 'sometimes', 'way', 'problems', 'handled', 'clearly', 'issue', 'airline', 'needs', 'work', 'service', 'bad', 'recent', 'service', 'rather', 'poor', 'additional', 'seat', 'area', 'legroom', 'nice', 'option', 'customers', 'little', 'tv', 'screens', 'offering', 'movies', 'music', 'welcome', 'help', 'longer', 'food', 'options', 'questionable', 'mentioned', 'tardiness', 'rude', 'attending', 'staff', 'terminals', 'coupled', 'recent', 'issues', 'like', 'able', 'print', 'boarding', 'passes', 'online', 'really', 'sour', 'service']","['customer', 'review']",neg

I am currently in Limbo about which airline to change my loyalty to but there is nothing Air Canada can do to retain me.

Air Canada customer review,L Beeldman,Not Verified,SYD-YVR and YYZ-SYD in May. The only reason these very long flights were bearable was the extra we paid for Exit row seats. I had read reviews about Exit row seats being reassigned but thankfully our seats were in order except they hardly reclined at all. AC probably charges the highest rate for Preferred seats than any other airline I have flown. The flight staff were mostly friendly another stroke of luck I believe. The IFE was not that good even though we had our own headphones the sound was very bad. The food served on both flights was the worst I have eaten on a flight in a very long time. Unappetising fridge cold bread rolls/wraps quite inedible. We had gone prepared fortunately took some snacks with us otherwise a 15 hour flight without eating could well have been the result. Ground staff in SYD were fine VR and YYZ not great. We had issues with carrying Duty free in our hand luggage on the YVR/YYZ sector because staff had not been advised of the change in rules. We were made to open our suitcases to try and fit the liquor in before the staff concerned realised she had made an error. I can say with all honesty I would not fly AC again.

Air Canada customer review,Kyle Thiel,Not Verified,Our Detroit to Toronto flight was cancelled after being delayed several hours which ensured we didn't have enough time to find another flight to make our Toronto to Munich connection despite originally having a 4.5 hour layover. Air Canada has no physical agents present at Detroit so after finally getting through to customer service we were able to rebook for the next day with an extra layover. The next day we get to Toronto to find out that they rebooked us on an overbooked flight so we actually found an Air Canada agent there to rebook us on a flight for later that night on a different airline. Coming back from Munich our flight was yet again cancelled after being delayed several hours ensuring we had no time to find a different flight. Of course there are no Air Canada agents to talk to in Munich either and the poor Lufthansa agents were terribly confused.

Air Canada customer review,MacMillan David,Not Verified,London to Montreal on Air Canada's new high density 452 seat 777-300ER. Check in was quick and boarding was a bit chaotic give huge number of passengers waiting in relatively small gate but priority boarding for business class was OK.

Mine wasn't great with thin armrest on aisle side and was constantly bumped by crew and passengers.

Air Canada customer review,S Jensen,Not Verified,"Toronto-DC-Toronto in mid-May and paid the $25 per bag fee for checked baggage. Too many ""economy-minded"" passengers didn't want to pay this reasonable fee so opted to bring over-stuffed bags onto the flight as ""carry-on""s. One woman with such a bag PLUS a large backpack so large it could not fit under the seat. These people were not directed by AC staff to check their bags the consequence being that there was insufficient in-cabin overhead bin space causing a delay in boarding of over 20 minutes. This caused us to queue on the runway for over half an hour waiting for clearance from air traffic control. The result - we left DC around the time we were supposed to land in Toronto. Contacted AC regarding this irritation and received an email that the wait-time for a response is twenty working days (yes that's a month!)

I am a 100K Aeroplan member and this dreadful experience led me to avoid Air Canada since. With other airlines upgrading their already superior products one is left to wonder why Air Canada has chosen to downgrade theirs. I can only imagine the plight in economy where an extra seat has been jammed into each row. On a positive note I have discovered the advantages offered by the competition - of which there is plenty.

The seat was as comfortable as I've ever had in economy with sufficient legroom for me even in a standard row. Service was hit-or-miss. On the way over we had a very friendly cheerful crew but on the way back the flight attendants were very snappy and unbelievably inconsiderate to passengers that didn't speak English or French. The food was mediocre compared to the meals I got on the connecting FRA-MAD leg on Lufthansa which is sort of disappointing for a 9-hour flight versus a 2 hour flight. The selection of wine was worse than Iberia Regional offered on MAD-GRX no less. It's not a huge deal to me I didn't expect to eat and drink like a king but when you look at what other airlines are offering I can't help but feel embarrassed for my national airline. The IFE system was decent with a good variety of TV shows and movies. Unfortunately the in-flight map didn't work on the return segment but that's a very minor complaint.

For a while AC had really improved their product making it better than BA. Not any more. The new AC high density 777-300 on the YVR-LHR route is awful In business the Pods are gone. The seat pitch is much reduced. The seat is poorly constructed and difficult to change position. The table is bizarre - spring loaded and very difficult to put back. The lie flat is not comfortable and has no privacy. You have to climb over the aisle passenger to get out. This is a serious serious downgrade and I cant see how they can compete against CX on the HKG route or BA to LHR. In economy its 3-4-3 which looked awful. Premium economy is 2-4-2. the centre rows look very cramped. I should add that the lounge at LHR is the SAS lounge which has very limited range of food/drinks.

My complaints are not so much about having to sit side by side someone in the rows but rather its the amenities and the way in which the seats work altogether. The flat bed seats are most uncomfortable. The seats do not accommodate one from moving their feet because once the bed is flat your feet go into an area that does not allow for any movement. You must physically remove one foot at a time to adjust your resting position. Headphones in business class are awful. They provide ear bud style head sets but they are cheap and sound quality is awful. You can request an over the ear headphone which they have on board but do not offer unless asked. Sound quality is better but when they deliver the units to you there are sponge coverings that must be affixed over each ear speaker. This task is incredibly difficult! The sponge coverings do not fit well over the oval speakers and the sponge has a tendency to rip! The controls for the seats are located in two locations - one on the table that is used to rest your arms. This of course means unintentional adjustments are made to your seat settings when your arms rest on the controls. The second set of controls are not easy to find at first and are only usable when the seat is in a flat bed mode. I also had difficulty having the bed go into a flat bed mode. The seats seam to get jammed on settings that would not allow the bed to fully extend and it took some time and multiple pressing of buttons to convince the seat to fully extend. Last beef concerns the tray table. Whoever designed this table should be shot! At first the table seems reasonable: press a release button and pop goes the table. Fold it out and you are in business. Now the tricky part - putting the table away. Folding is ok but then you have to align three very faintly marked arrows and then figure out a way to force the table back into its locked position. I couldn't do it and required assistance each and every time. It was interesting to hear from the flight crew that there have been many many complaints about these new seats. Air Canada however is not taking any steps to address these concerns which is too bad. The crew mentioned that the seating was an after thought and that they were not asked for any advice or input on the selection of the consoles. Too bad. I will be going out of my way not to use Air Canada because of this uncomfortable experience. Other airlines like Cathay and Singapore have far better seats and amenities. Use them.",3rd May 2014,,Business Class,,,1,4,3,3,0,0,1,[],0,12.0,5,2.4,0.0,-0.011804087385482729,"['concerns', 'business', 'class', 'service', 'international', 'introduced', 'new', 'seat', 'configurations', 'aircrafts', 'marked', 'change', 'pods', 'uses', 'regrettably', 'new', 'configurations', 'horrible', 'complaints', 'much', 'sit', 'side', 'side', 'someone', 'rows', 'rather', 'amenities', 'way', 'seats', 'work', 'altogether', 'flat', 'bed', 'seats', 'uncomfortable', 'seats', 'accommodate', 'moving', 'feet', 'bed', 'flat', 'feet', 'area', 'allow', 'movement', 'must', 'physically', 'remove', 'foot', 'time', 'adjust', 'resting', 'position', 'headphones', 'business', 'class', 'awful', 'provide', 'ear', 'bud', 'style', 'head', 'sets', 'cheap', 'sound', 'quality', 'awful', 'request', 'ear', 'headphone', 'board', 'offer', 'unless', 'asked', 'sound', 'quality', 'better', 'deliver', 'units', 'sponge', 'coverings', 'must', 'affixed', 'ear', 'speaker', 'task', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'sponge', 'coverings', 'fit', 'well', 'oval', 'speakers', 'sponge', 'tendency', 'rip', 'controls', 'seats', 'located', 'locations', 'table', 'used', 'rest', 'arms', 'course', 'means', 'unintentional', 'adjustments', 'seat', 'settings', 'arms', 'rest', 'controls', 'second', 'set', 'controls', 'easy', 'find', 'first', 'usable', 'seat', 'flat', 'bed', 'mode', 'difficulty', 'bed', 'flat', 'bed', 'mode', 'seats', 'seam', 'jammed', 'settings', 'allow', 'bed', 'fully', 'extend', 'took', 'time', 'multiple', 'pressing', 'buttons', 'convince', 'seat', 'fully', 'extend', 'last', 'beef', 'concerns', 'tray', 'table', 'whoever', 'designed', 'table', 'shot', 'first', 'table', 'seems', 'reasonable', 'press', 'release', 'button', 'pop', 'goes', 'table', 'fold', 'business', 'tricky', 'part', 'putting', 'table', 'away', 'folding', 'ok', 'align', 'three', 'faintly', 'marked', 'arrows', 'figure', 'way', 'force', 'table', 'back', 'locked', 'position', 'required', 'assistance', 'every', 'time', 'interesting', 'hear', 'crew', 'many', 'many', 'complaints', 'new', 'seats', 'taking', 'steps', 'address', 'concerns', 'bad', 'crew', 'mentioned', 'seating', 'thought', 'asked', 'advice', 'input', 'selection', 'consoles', 'bad', 'going', 'way', 'use', 'uncomfortable', 'experience', 'airlines', 'like', 'cathay', 'singapore', 'far', 'better', 'seats', 'amenities', 'use']","['customer', 'review']",neg
Air Canada customer review,P Butler,Not Verified,"AC138 Vancouver-Ottawa. Usual AC crush on boarding with lots of people with too much carry-on no enforcement of carry on policy and insufficient space in aircraft cabin design for carry-on seems to be a universal feature of AC that you have to fight for bin space. Cabin crew managed to pack everyone's stuff in. 6 row seating and only 2 washrooms for about 160 people no doubt maximizes AC revenue when combined with overbooking - but no room to move in the cabin two people can't pass in the aisles without standing on the aisle seat passenger. Seats cramped. Flight safety briefings are now followed by full volume ads for BMW and credit card products. Inflight service then began by cabin staff selling earphones. Chose not to purchase later realized this a wise choice in view of limited inflight entertainment options. Food service - if you're asleep when they come round don't worry - if the cart doesn't wake you by banging your elbow as it comes by you will be shouted at until you do wake up and a menu card is wafted under your nose. AC wouldn't want to miss a sale just because you're sleeping! Being now awake looked at menu which offers ""selection of wines"" - turns out this means red or white one brand each. Ordered pieces of stiff cardboard and plastic paid full bar prices. In future AC would have to be the only carrier on a route before I'd fly them again and I would never recommend them.

Air Canada customer review,Aske Stentoft,Not Verified,"Miami - Toronto - Copenhagen 24th April 2014. AC917 - A321 AC882 - B763-300. My family and I went to Florida on vacation. We flew out with Lufthansa - excellent service. On the way back we flew with Air Canada. I had pre- selected seats close to the wing (row 27) the B763 has 2-3-2 seating setup so selecting 2x2 was perfect for us. When we checked in at Miami airport we were told our seating had changed for the flight between Toronto and Copenhagen. Our seating was now: me my wife and my son (age 10) moved to the middle section in row 35 and my daughter (age 5) placed on row 14. I tried to talk to 3 different staff members in Miami airport none was interested in helping us. One suggested we could find a passenger ourselves to swap with. When we were boarding they realized it probably wasn't a good idea to place a 5 year old alone and swapped the seating. I am shocked about the lack of service. What shocked me the most is that I tried to talk to 7 different Air Canada staff members. On top of that (which just is minor compared to all the other): Their ""continental breakfast"" was a dry banana cake. Their entertainment system was so good that I could hear both my own movie and the movie of the passenger next to me.

Air Canada customer review,Tyler Thomson,Not Verified,Flight 165 from Montreal to Calgary. The crew were impeccably dressed which can make or break a first impression. I was seated in the economy cabin directly behind business class and was expecting a standard North American carrier style of service but instead received more. The business class flight attendant was sure to make sure my drinks were always topped up and even went as far as to refer to me by name a very pleasant surprise in economy. The flight crew were friendly and present throughout the entire flight. Multiple water runs occurred. Legroom was generous in the bulkhead row and the cabin was clean and fresh. The inflight entertainment system was also up to date with multiple options for programming.

Air Canada customer review,Hammond Josephine,Not Verified,AC855 on 4th November 2013 from YVR to Heathrow London. I returned on AC854 27th November 2013. Breakfast as the last meal on the plane was a real come-down. It should leave passengers with a satisfied feeling glad they chose Air Canada for their journey. Instead a piece of cellophane-covered yellow cloggy sponge slice that tasted of nothing paired with a small sweetened yoghourt. It was such a sad and disappointing closure to my trip. Regarding the holding pattern over Heathrow it was amazingly beautiful but that only made the unpleasant breakfast experience worse!

Air Canada customer review,E Bierduempel,Not Verified,BGI-YTO-FRA. Found out upon check-in that plane would be delayed by 2-3 hours thus missing my connection. Was told that I would have to stay overnight in Toronto and was already rebooked for a connecting flight next day. My email address and mobile phone number were given in the booking but nobody from AC contacted me beforehand. Upon boarding I saw a second AC plane on the tarmac. Pilot explained that the plane was grounded due to technical problems 2 days ago and ever since they were struggling to find replacement planes. Also the incoming plane was delayed due to technical problems. But no information prior to check-in resulted in no chance to rebook thus missing an important meeting and wasting 19 hours at YTO.

Air Canada customer review,D Tomlinson,Not Verified,Return flights on new Air Canada B777 High Density YVR-HKG and YVR-LHR in last month. With the new high density configuration Air Canada has lowered themselves to a truly awful class of business travel. Seats are uncomfortable and cramped controls to recline are finicky and require a lot of to and fro'ing to get seat into lay down position. There is no storage space around your seat for storage of pillow blanket or your shoes. Staff are clearly not happy with new service nor are other frequent passengers. If traveling alone do not take an aisle seat on either side of the cabin - the window seat occupant cannot leave their seat without having you get out of your seat. Cathay and BA much better choices as they are either less costly (or the same price) and you get a personal pod.

Air Canada customer review,S Moore,Not Verified,My wife and I booked a trip to the Caribbean in May 2013 to travel in early April 2014. We used a popular online service for our flight reservations. On our return trip back home to Michigan we had to go round about through Toronto switching airlines to Air Canada for our half hour last leg home. We arrived at Toronto to find that We had less than an hour to connect flights and our baggage wouldn't be checked through to our final destination so after waiting 25 minutes for our luggage and a long trek through a huge unfamiliar airport we missed our flight. But instead of putting us on the next available flight the attendant at check-in directed us to call ticket information. After about 20 minutes of being on hold we ended up at an information desk and they sent us back to the check-in counter where we encountered a gentleman who proceeded to blame us for the mix up arguing and threatening to charge us $250US to rebook. This went on for some time then after we had given up and were going to pay (again) for the flight he abruptly stopped rebooked the flight told us he was doing us a favor and we were on our way.

Air Canada customer review,S Ray,Not Verified,We flew LGA-YUL and back on AC. My finance and I flew out separately and returned together. Staff were polite enough in LGA but displayed a consistently lackadaisical attitude. They didn't start boarding the flights until 10 minutes or less before scheduled departure (even though the plane had been at the gate for at least 30 minutes prior) so predictably both flights pulled back from the gate late. My flight then took a 30 minute tour around the taxiways which granted AC has no control over but they provided no updates or anything until we finally started our take off. On the return trip we first ran in to possibly the rudest person working a service job I've ever encountered at YUL. The second AC employee we dealt with was quite nice and apologized for her co-worker. Again at the gate the staff was lackadaisical fumbling around and not boarding the flight until 10 minutes before departure (even though the boarding pass said boarding would start 55 minutes prior to departure and the plane was at the gate for a good 20 minutes at least before boarding started). Luckily it only lead to 5-10 minutes delay on the YUL-LGA trip. On all 3 flights there were no announcements about how or where to pick up baggage when we landed. Overall I feel like we were lucky that our AC experience was only somewhat bad. The general attitude and competency of the AC staff gave me absolutely no confidence that they would have been able to handle any real problems.

Tried the dim sum chicken breast skewers and fruit - all good. The pod seating is very comfortable. What really impressed was that the washrooms were so clean throughout the entire 15 hour flight. I used them frequently and they were always spotless. Air Canada really stepped it up on their international business class.

Air Canada customer review,Andrew McCubbin,Not Verified,YVR to LHR return. Both flights quite satisfactory even with 100% full plane on return trip. All staff keen and some put out real effort. Two issues: Very poor food on return trip. Not really edible at all and the plane was a few minutes late in LHR with getting a landing slot. We went merrily to the Maple Leaf arrivals lounge for a shower and a bit of food after the flight. We got there at 12.45 and was told it was closed for showers and limited for food. It says it closes at 1.30 and we thought there was plenty of time for both. Staff were lifeless.

Air Canada customer review,Judy Rump,Not Verified,We recently were on a flight from Los Cabos BCS Mexico to Toronto. We departed Mexico just after noon for our 5 hour flight. Not long after take off the staff proceeded to sell food. We were seated towards the rear of the plane and therefore expected to have slim pickings from the menu. We did not expect a total sell out of meals. We had a choice of a few snack items such as chocolate bar chips twizzlers and nuts. According to staff they sold out after 1st class and had to even sell off staff meals.

Air Canada customer review,Jaydon Baha,Not Verified,Los Angeles - Vancouver full Embraer E190 was a very pleasant flight despite the time late at night. The service was great and very friendly. Overall the aircraft was good and fairly new with spacious seats arrangements of 2 and 2 and great entertainment system (though the TV's could use a bit of improvement). Onboard cafe was overall normal and the menu selection was good. The terminal's Air Canada operated out of were efficient and my bags came out very fast. Turn around time was fast.

Air Canada customer review,E Dean,Not Verified,High Density 777-300 YYZ-YVR treated myself to an upgrade to Premium Economy and I must say I was extremely happy after seeing the cattle-car arrangement just behind me. PE is great! Seats are huge like domestic Executive Class on A320's A319's and A321's on AC but only if the upgrade is offered relatively cheap. My one complaint is that there should be a curtain divider between PE and economy and the cabin doesn't feel separated or intimate and noise and crowds spill over into PE. AC's new EnRoute system is a high upgrade over the old high-rez monitors much easier interface and improved maps. Seats are large leather arm-chairs same as Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic small footrest and small cocktail table in armrest. The economy 3-4-3 is just totally unacceptable to a North American consumer who are typically much larger than in other parts of the world. At baggage claim the complaints were loud people all around me talking of the horrid cramped conditions seats that don't breath and suffering passengers. AC get rid of this product it's horrid!!

Air Canada customer review,A Eric,Not Verified,I am a Million Miler who flies business on long haul with AC. The angle pod seats were a great addition some time ago and provided business passengers with a feeling of value for money-true lay flats reasonable privacy etc. I cannot understand why AC would want to screw this all up with the new high density layouts in both business and economy-the business seats are resulting in mass complaints and mass desertions to other airlines. They downgraded their product to Hong Kong (in economy there are two or three fewer washrooms for 100 more passengers line ups a mile long the toilets are backing up as they are not designed for this volume of passengers. I have never in all my years heard more angry passengers than the Honk Kong to Vancouver AC passengers in any class. For a crass money grab on these routes AC is risking a big revenue loss to Japan airlines Cathay and other Asian airlines and on Europe runs to British Air and others even Lufthansa.

Air Canada customer review,Ronald Kerr-Miller,Not Verified,The new business class cabin on Vancouver to Hong Kong is a big downgrade. The seats go down under the armrests of the seats in front of you so you lie in a narrow casket-shaped space - your legs can't move up and down at all but the part of the lid over you chest and face is open. When the passengers put their seats back up it literally looks like vampires rising out of caskets. It's very cramped and there's no privacy. The herring bone pods were worth the money to me - you got a smidgen of privacy. The new configuration is back to 2 across (ex for a few singleton seats that are always gone already) so you have someone breathing at you from a foot away that you have to crawl over to get to the aisle.

Air Canada customer review,M Villeneuve,Not Verified,Just flew Air Canada Rouge (Toronto to Montego Bay) for the first time. Had heard horror stories and read the reviews about them so took nothing to chance. We took our own food to eat (which we have done for years with regular Air Canada) and had movies on our laptop to watch rather than the common movie which was being shown on the plane. I had also downloaded their entertainment app on my iPod in advance so could watch their entertainment system as well. Flight down was delayed leaving for about half hour and flight back slightly delayed. Took advantage of their single cart service when it was offered for soft drinks but other than that didn't ask for anything. The flight itself was no worse than some regular Air Canada flights I have taken and we were fortunately we were able to get the bulk head (at an extra cost) so had sufficient leg room. Overall was satisfied with the flight because I expected nothing from them other than flying me to my destination.,24th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,3,0,0,4,[],0,15.0,5,3.0,0.0,0.066984126984127,"['flew', 'rouge', 'montego', 'bay', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'horror', 'stories', 'read', 'reviews', 'took', 'nothing', 'chance', 'took', 'food', 'eat', 'done', 'years', 'regular', 'movies', 'laptop', 'watch', 'rather', 'common', 'movie', 'shown', 'plane', 'downloaded', 'entertainment', 'app', 'ipod', 'advance', 'watch', 'entertainment', 'system', 'well', 'delayed', 'leaving', 'half', 'hour', 'back', 'slightly', 'delayed', 'took', 'advantage', 'single', 'cart', 'service', 'offered', 'soft', 'drinks', 'ask', 'anything', 'worse', 'regular', 'taken', 'fortunately', 'able', 'bulk', 'head', 'extra', 'cost', 'sufficient', 'leg', 'room', 'overall', 'satisfied', 'expected', 'nothing', 'flying', 'destination']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Air Canada customer review,Michael Carter,Not Verified,YYZ-NRT in Y class. I take this flight several times per year. It is a convenient direct flight from Toronto to Tokyo. This flight left on time (actually departing the gate a few minutes before the scheduled noon departure time) and we were in the air at 12:09 with no lengthy runaway or taxiing delays. Arrived a few minutes early in Tokyo. To me this flight is a notch above the standard AC product. They seem to be a little more attentive on their transpacific flights and the flights generally have a good on time performance. Service consists of full meal shortly after takeoff snack about 6 hours later (noodle cup/sandwiches) and breakfast prior to arrival. Drinks (including alcohol) are complimentary.

Air Canada customer review,Vineet Bapat,Not Verified,Zurich to Toronto (Flight 879 on Feb. 13) on a rather ageing tired Boeing 767 - however it was not a full flight so we could easily change our assigned bulkhead seats to two by the window in an exit row - which afforded us great legroom. FAs were wonderful - a senior crew - very welcoming helpful and chatty. Likewise the pilot was great fully informing and updating passengers of a slight delay due to a technical glitch and later alerting us to a great view of the southern tip of Greenland when we flew over it. After an equally long flight from Mumbai in the rather cramped seating on a Swiss A330 this flight was a spacious delight. Food was OK AVOD was good with a wide selection of movies music and TV shows. The FA selling duty free items undertook the extra effort to locate what I wanted to buy when he could not find it on the cart. Not a commonly expressed sentiment but the crew on this Air Canada flight went above and beyond the call in providing a level of service seldom encountered in the economy cabin!,20th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,4,0,0,4,[],0,20.0,5,4.0,0.0,0.22698412698412707,"['zurich', 'rather', 'ageing', 'tired', 'boeing', 'full', 'easily', 'change', 'assigned', 'bulkhead', 'seats', 'window', 'exit', 'row', 'afforded', 'great', 'legroom', 'fas', 'wonderful', 'senior', 'crew', 'welcoming', 'helpful', 'chatty', 'likewise', 'pilot', 'great', 'fully', 'informing', 'updating', 'passengers', 'slight', 'delay', 'due', 'technical', 'glitch', 'later', 'alerting', 'great', 'view', 'southern', 'tip', 'greenland', 'flew', 'equally', 'long', 'rather', 'cramped', 'seating', 'swiss', 'spacious', 'delight', 'food', 'ok', 'avod', 'good', 'wide', 'selection', 'movies', 'music', 'tv', 'shows', 'fa', 'selling', 'duty', 'free', 'items', 'undertook', 'extra', 'effort', 'locate', 'wanted', 'buy', 'find', 'cart', 'commonly', 'expressed', 'sentiment', 'crew', 'beyond', 'call', 'providing', 'level', 'service', 'seldom', 'encountered', 'economy', 'cabin']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Cora Martin,Not Verified,IAH to YYZ to PEK to IAH. Flew economy in January check-in at IAH was fine and smooth so was the boarding process. Only one major delay on the last leg of the flight. But during the first flight from IAH to YYZ the FA was incredibly rude to my family when we asked about the drink offerings. While chewing gum she blatantly told us that all we got is soda juice and water. The flight from YYZ to PEK wasn't all that great either. Flight attendants yelled at one of my family members when we tried to put our bags into the overhead bins. The bags weren't even that large! They fit in the bag size check at the gate we checked twice! The only positive experience on Air Canada was on my last leg of the flight from YYZ to IAH. The plane had been delayed for nearly two hours due to weather which was understandable and downgraded to a smaller jet. One of the women on-board turned belligerent when told by a flight attendant that there wasn't any food available to purchase. The flight attendant offered to give the upset woman her dinner but she refused and remained inconsolable. What to take out of my experience: Don't fly Air Canada unless you absolutely have to and use this airline as a last resort.

Air Canada customer review,Julien Marin,Not Verified,Just flew with Air Canada Rouge for the first time. I've been a dedicated Air Canada flyer for many years with Status alternating between Elite and Super Elite. Rouge is a big step down for their regular flight service: reduced legroom uncomfortable chairs inexperienced flight attendants. The lady next to me was not able to be served in French so I had to act as the translator for the attendants this was unacceptable! The Entertainment system changed to an App or browser-based system. I'm not opposed to this but it would be much better if they provided a system on which I can mount my tablet rather than staring down at the table-top the whole flight. Moreover if you have an Ipad you will need to download the app ahead of the flight (or have the Google Chrome browser installed) otherwise you won't be able to view movies onboard. TV viewing will still work through the regular browser (not sure why TV and Movie streaming would be all that different but anyhow). They should offer the capability of downloading the require app (or Chrome) from the plane's entertainment system directly.

Air Canada customer review,K Yount,Not Verified,I recently spent between $3000 and $4000 for 3 seats on Air Canada for a vacation to the United Kingdom for my wife sister and me. It was important for all of us to sit together. When I tried to get seat assignments their computer system did not work. I had to call instead and spent much time on the phone getting it done. We made the flight to London and were served a small breakfast and I was skipped. On the flight home we were shunted from one departure gate to another. On our third different one the computer system would not work and we were told we would have to be moved yet again when it finally kicked in. As we were boarding our final flight the stewardess pulled my sister from her seat and gave it to another person. I protested and asked how that could happen and we were told that a husband and wife who had not bothered to reserve adjacent seats had asked for my sister's reserved seat and they just gave it to them breaking up our family group to do so.

Air Canada customer review,Paxton Kim,Not Verified,Whilst most elements of the flights we took with Air Canada were acceptable rather than outstanding there were two elements that were really poor. Firstly the entertainment system was not working on one 7hr flight and the first stewardess just said she'd look into it but didn't. The second steward admitted they knew it was broken. The real issue though is that the only recompense offered was 5% off our next Air Canada flight.

Seating was cramped and uncomfortable and the staff on ground and inflight seemed rude and unprofessional unlike anything we have ever experienced. They even tried sending my 5 year old from the washroom at the front of the plane to the rear as not to disturb the people in so called first class. First class meaning they were separated from the rest of us with a curtain falling down and enjoyed a drink of cola while we had water because they ran out of pop part at the back of the aircraft.,10th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,1,3,1,0,0,1,[],0,7.0,5,1.4,0.0,0.12106481481481483,"['flew', 'rouge', 'jan', 'never', 'use', 'airline', 'fly', 'drive', 'delayed', 'staff', 'use', 'pr', 'training', 'assured', 'hardly', 'ever', 'delays', 'seating', 'cramped', 'uncomfortable', 'staff', 'ground', 'inflight', 'seemed', 'rude', 'unprofessional', 'unlike', 'anything', 'ever', 'experienced', 'tried', 'sending', 'year', 'old', 'washroom', 'front', 'plane', 'rear', 'disturb', 'people', 'called', 'first', 'class', 'first', 'class', 'meaning', 'separated', 'rest', 'curtain', 'falling', 'enjoyed', 'drink', 'cola', 'water', 'ran', 'pop', 'part', 'back', 'aircraft']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Jake McCall,Not Verified,Jan 18 my wife son and I flew to Sarasota. The trip down was ok although we've never encountered such uncomfortable seats as that flight. The trip back on Feb 1 was awful. We arrived at Sarasota early expecting to catch the flight at 6pm-ish back to Toronto. When asked if the flight was on time the attendants answered 'no it'll be leaving Toronto an hour later than scheduled.' As time went by it became clear that not only was the flight not going to leave an hour late from Toronto it was actually in transit from Orlando to Toronto. Eventually the flight (1881) arrived in Sarasota at roughly 11pm and after disembarking passengers and cleaning left at roughly 11.30pm. The flight eventually arrived in Toronto by now it's roughly 2.30am and everyone is exhausted. Eventually we reached our home in downtown Toronto at roughly 4am.

Air Canada customer review,S Meler,Not Verified,On 7/1/2014 my connecting flight from Montreal to Brussels was delayed and then subsequently cancelled and rescheduled for the next day. We were made to wait board disembark and eventually to collect our baggage told to sleep in the airport with a thin blanket in freezing temperatures and to check in yet again the following day. As I was in transit this was even more taxing. Air Canada should have provided passengers with meal vouchers/food and hotel accommodation. Before boarding (after 4 hours of waiting) a few parents with young children asked for some water and sandwiches for their children. Their requests were flatly denied. I approached the purser to ask for water and something to eat when we had finally boarded after hours of waiting but I was impolitely brushed off and made to feel greedy even though I had been travelling for 12 hours at that point and was starving. After we were finally informed that the crew were no longer legal and that we had to disembark and spend the night in the airport we were informed that there were no available hotel rooms. I have never encountered such a blasé attitude towards passenger comfort. To add insult to injury there was no vegetarian meal (as I had requested months in advance).,4th February 2014,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,3,0,0,1,[],0,9.0,5,1.8,0.0,-0.0017857142857142874,"['connecting', 'montreal', 'delayed', 'subsequently', 'cancelled', 'rescheduled', 'day', 'wait', 'board', 'disembark', 'eventually', 'collect', 'baggage', 'told', 'sleep', 'airport', 'thin', 'blanket', 'freezing', 'temperatures', 'check', 'yet', 'following', 'day', 'transit', 'taxing', 'provided', 'passengers', 'meal', 'hotel', 'accommodation', 'boarding', 'hours', 'waiting', 'parents', 'young', 'children', 'asked', 'water', 'sandwiches', 'children', 'requests', 'flatly', 'denied', 'approached', 'purser', 'ask', 'water', 'something', 'eat', 'finally', 'boarded', 'hours', 'waiting', 'impolitely', 'brushed', 'feel', 'greedy', 'though', 'travelling', 'hours', 'point', 'starving', 'finally', 'informed', 'crew', 'longer', 'legal', 'disembark', 'spend', 'night', 'airport', 'informed', 'available', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'never', 'encountered', 'blasé', 'attitude', 'towards', 'passenger', 'comfort', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'vegetarian', 'meal', 'requested', 'months', 'advance']","['customer', 'review']",neg
Air Canada customer review,Sakuragi Hana,Not Verified,I've flown with Air Canada numerous times and have noticed a general improvement in staff service. That being said my flight from Vancouver to Seoul on New Year's Eve was a little uncomfortable. The sinks were blocked off with aluminium foil and there was no running water. Instead there was a box full of antiseptic towelettes which was thoughtful. However the mere thought of how many unwashed hands went in the box frightens me.

Air Canada customer review,Alasdair Clarke,Not Verified,"Flew from London Heathrow to Toronto via Montreal - our entertainment system did not work. When I asked a flight attendant for help they replied sharply ""We are a travel company not an entertainment company"". So I asked another flight attendant who was equally as rude. We were offered a flight with a time of only 50 minutes to connect to our next leg. This is undoable anyway we thought surely? But when our flight arrived 45 minutes late it caused all sorts of stressful complications. On return back to London from Toronto our flight was initially delayed by 4 hours but only pushing in half hour increments. So very frustrating. Short-staffed and totally unhelpful the staff were cleared stressed and it showed. We finally made it onto the plane on which we sat for 3 hours before being told to get off and come back 14 hours later as there was a problem with the plane (they had put water into a freezing cold plane which froze in the pipes expanded and burst).

Air Canada customer review,Hottola Petri,Not Verified,In Dec-Jan 2014 I flew 4 legs on Air Canada Munich-Toronto-Miami and Miami-Montreal-Frankfurt each of them delayed with a total of 35 hours. All delays were controllable apparently being caused by shortage of staff in airport operations. Being stuck in Montreal airport for 24 hours I got a Holiday Inn voucher but the meal vouchers did not actually cover meals unlike with other airlines' passengers staying at the hotel. Had to stand three hours in a line of five people to get the hotel voucher at the Air Canada counter at the Pierre Trudeau. For a lunch voucher I got a small cup of Pepsi from a tap and water no food. The way the airline struggled with computer maintenance (delay of 4+ hrs from Montreal to Frankfurt) was frightening in terms of flight security.

There was a problem with my ticket but the airport ticket office agent was sincere and thorough dissolving the stress and resolving the issue with a smile. Air Canada uses American Airlines' Admiral's Club in Santiago which is very pleasant but quite full at night. The gate was crowded and announcements were difficult to hear but boarding was orderly and efficient. The cabin crew was outstanding on this packed overnight flight. And this makes all the difference. Welcoming friendly sincere. We pushed back within 15 minutes of departure time. I opted for the full dinner. While the food itself was average the service was very attentive (this crew hustled!) and the wine selections were surprisingly good. The IFE system had a wide range of choices and was fairly intuitive to use. The bathrooms appeared worn but were clean. The lie flat seat (3D) is very comfortable. Breakfast was a disappointing rubbery omelette but I appreciated being able to sleep until shortly before landing. The breakfast buffet in the Maple Leaf Lounge was very pleasant the receptionists were gracious and there was no wait for a shower room to freshen up before my connecting flight.

Air Canada customer review,G Mastrobuono,Not Verified,BRU-YVR via YUL on 767 and A320 both ways. Service attentive but not overbearing. The seats were comfortable and the food was good but nothing to rave about. Flight 2 hours delayed leaving BRU due to heavy thunder and lighting and I missed my connection in YUL before even leaving BRU. I mentioned this to the FA and when I went to recheck my bag in YUL after customs my boarding pass for the next flight to YVR was waiting for me. On the return YUL-BRU leg the service was a bit rushed and it seemed like the FAs just wanted to get it over with and hang out in the galley. I also noticed a certain haughtiness among Air Canada's FAs on international routes. They're the top of the heap seniority-wise in the company and they know it.,7th January 2014,,Business Class,,,4,4,4,5,0,0,5,[],0,22.0,5,4.4,0.0,0.20992063492063492,"['via', 'yul', 'ways', 'service', 'attentive', 'overbearing', 'seats', 'comfortable', 'food', 'good', 'nothing', 'rave', 'hours', 'delayed', 'leaving', 'bru', 'due', 'heavy', 'thunder', 'lighting', 'missed', 'connection', 'yul', 'leaving', 'bru', 'mentioned', 'fa', 'recheck', 'bag', 'yul', 'customs', 'boarding', 'pass', 'yvr', 'waiting', 'return', 'leg', 'service', 'bit', 'rushed', 'seemed', 'like', 'fas', 'wanted', 'hang', 'galley', 'noticed', 'certain', 'haughtiness', 'among', 'fas', 'international', 'routes', 'top', 'heap', 'company', 'know']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,W Pura,Not Verified,"I just returned from a a month long trip throughout east Asia with the major part of trip - across Canada to Vancouver and then across the Pacific with Air Canada. I have done this trip many times in the last few years but this year was particularly bad. I am a tall person and the tiny regional jet to Vancouver was bad enough with cramped seating and small overhead storage but the long haul across the Pacific was particularly uncomfortable. Clearly AC can order their planes with the seating configs they prefer so with 40-50 seat rows they can easily squeeze in another row in by trimming off a 1/2"" from each row making leg room just that little bit less. Heading out from Vancouver the food was decent but the movie selection was pretty poor. No major current releases and a lot of older stuff. As a result of travelling extensively in the Asia region I must have been on 6 or 7 airlines and when it came time to head home to Canada I had plenty to compare Air Canada to. When it comes to national carriers like Egyptair (Jakarta to Bangkok) or Thai Air (Bangkok to Shanghai) Air Canada doesn't even come close. On the return flight to Canada the plane was an older B767 with the same cramped seating as before. When I checked out the movies they were the same ones that were listed over a month earlier. This time the food was really bad. I usually eat what the airlines provide given it was such a long trip but this time I had to push it away unfinished. Somewhere during the night they passed out some tasteless sandwich rolled up in a plastic wrapper. It is shameful for Canada's national carrier not to have the best on such a crucial route for international business. I expect to be making this trip again and I will make every effort to make my connections with another carrier.",6th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,1,3,1,2,0,0,2,[],0,9.0,5,1.8,0.0,-0.055266203703703685,"['returned', 'month', 'long', 'trip', 'throughout', 'east', 'asia', 'major', 'part', 'trip', 'across', 'across', 'pacific', 'done', 'trip', 'many', 'times', 'last', 'years', 'year', 'particularly', 'bad', 'tall', 'person', 'tiny', 'regional', 'jet', 'bad', 'enough', 'cramped', 'seating', 'small', 'overhead', 'storage', 'long', 'haul', 'across', 'pacific', 'particularly', 'uncomfortable', 'clearly', 'ac', 'order', 'planes', 'seating', 'configs', 'prefer', 'seat', 'rows', 'easily', 'squeeze', 'another', 'row', 'trimming', 'row', 'making', 'leg', 'room', 'little', 'bit', 'less', 'heading', 'food', 'decent', 'movie', 'selection', 'pretty', 'poor', 'major', 'current', 'releases', 'lot', 'older', 'stuff', 'result', 'travelling', 'extensively', 'asia', 'region', 'must', 'airlines', 'came', 'time', 'head', 'home', 'plenty', 'compare', 'comes', 'national', 'carriers', 'like', 'egyptair', 'jakarta', 'thai', 'come', 'close', 'return', 'plane', 'older', 'cramped', 'seating', 'checked', 'movies', 'ones', 'listed', 'month', 'earlier', 'time', 'food', 'really', 'bad', 'usually', 'eat', 'airlines', 'provide', 'given', 'long', 'trip', 'time', 'push', 'away', 'unfinished', 'somewhere', 'night', 'passed', 'tasteless', 'sandwich', 'rolled', 'plastic', 'wrapper', 'shameful', 'national', 'carrier', 'best', 'crucial', 'route', 'international', 'business', 'expect', 'making', 'trip', 'make', 'every', 'effort', 'make', 'connections', 'another', 'carrier']","['customer', 'review']",neg
Air Canada customer review,J Bennett,Not Verified,Arrived at Toronto and was told onward flight to Sudbury was ok so proceeded to hand in baggage for connection. Later we found that the flight was in fact cancelled and they then refused to give our bags bag. We were told by Air Canada to go to Section N. There were people here who had been in the queue for 4 hours not having an idea what they were queuing for and later finding out it was in fact for hotels not flights. After calling redial for 2 hours we gave up got a hotel ourselves and proceeded without our bags. When I rang air Canada they told me to go back to the airport if I needed them urgently. Our return flight from Sudbury was also cancelled and flight to London delayed heavily both without any notice or customer communication from Air Canada. We had also been told that if we required a special meal there was only one meal available on the first flight. I rang once being on hold for an hour the second for two hours and both without response. When I got to Pearson airport I immediately asked if something could be done about it the Air Canada person told me it's too late it has to be 24 hours before. When I told her I had been on hold for the amount she said there was nothing she could do about it. There was not even an incline of understanding from her or an eagerness to help me in any way whatsoever.

Air Canada customer review,W Bohlen,Not Verified,Flight from Vancouver to Brisbane. We paid extra for exit seats to get extra legroom. At Vancouver airport we were given our boarding passes and found we were sitting nowhere near our paid seats and not even sitting together. We complained at the counter and a very rude woman behind the counter said that that was tough luck. Lots of other passengers were complaining about the same thing. I kept complaining long enough so we eventually got the seats we paid extra for. The food on the flight was just horrible and nobody could guess what it was it was just stodge.

We checked in online selected our seats printed our boarding passes checked our luggage in and when we got to the gate they told us we could no longer sit in our allocated seats.

On the plane the seats are cramped the cabin staff generally unhelpful and rude insisting we take our full meal service even though we had an infant on our lap. As it was it didn't matter as the food was of a very poor standard. The inflight entertainment system clunky and limited choice the touch screen system not working effectively meant passengers behind constantly banging the screens and your seats trying to get the system to work.

Ground male staff in Vancouver (flight to LAX) was extremely rude and arrogant to most passengers including an elderly gentleman who was confused about payment for luggage.

Air Canada customer review,Jane Jamieson,Not Verified,AC Rouge to Samana (Dominican) December 8th returning the 15th 2013. I had never heard of 'Rouge' but was happy that I was flying AC with my 2 boys as they enjoy the TV's in the individual seats and AC is fairly reliable (based on about 4 decades of brand loyalty). I was disturbed to discover that they had taken all the TV's out of the individual seats and we could only access the in-flight entertainment if 1) we had known to download the app before we got on the plane as it won't download on an android phone. 2) Had an I/OS phone or Ipad or 3) rented an Ipad for $10 in flight - which would have amounted to $30 x 2 for the return flight. Staff appeared between about 20 and 25 years old and very immature and unable to make any decisions without asking the 'senior' attendant. They sounded rather robotic and lacked any sense of humour. The pilot never spoke on the way back we had some turbulence and we never heard from him. They offered us 2 free Ipads because I was unimpressed with their inability to entertain people without phones but the system was slow and unresponsive. Flight attendants disappeared for about 40 minutes off the top of the flight - nowhere to be found - very unprofessional. I paid more for my trip to Samana than virtually everyone I spoke to - and they flew other airlines that offered free meals and wine - we got nothing - and only 2 drinks on a 5 hour flight.

Air Canada customer review,S Greenhalgh,Not Verified,Flew Vancouver to Sydney November 2013 in a 777. What a great experience. The most space I've had on a long haul flight.

Air Canada customer review,Bruce Oliver,Not Verified,"This was my first experience with Rouge. My biggest concern and the main reason for the low rating is the training and comportment of the cabin crew. They were all young and obviously inexperienced. The boarding through two doors was completely bungled chaotic because proper procedures were not followed. I heard ""boarding completed"" reported twice at separate times so obviously there was confusion. They giggled their way through the safety announcements as if they were a private joke. I was left with a very distinct feeling that in case of emergency this crew would be no help at all in evacuation or other procedures. I have never felt that way on a commercial flight before. The Rouge design seems to be on the ""hipster"" model with banter such as ""you will get busted!"" referring to smoke detectors in the washrooms. Fair enough I guess flights do not have to be sombre to be safe I know from experience. But this needs to be better delivered in the Rouge case. There needs to be an adjustment of crew conduct related a better show of competence. The presence of a more mature (but cheerful!) crew manger would be a big help. I'm sure these are nice deserving young people who work hard and they are trying to make a cramped flight feel lighter. However the balance is not there for me at this point and I just felt generally on my own in case of emergency. I have always felt good about Air Canada and recommended it highly.

Air Canada customer review,Seth Martin,Not Verified,"YMM-YYZ-YMM weekly. Usually A319 sometimes A320 seldom E190 high vacation traffic season A321. Check in agents unfriendly Food poor Seats cramped and its always hot on the plane in either direction! Most passengers seem to over do it when it comes to their carry on baggage. This should be policed a lot better. I always only travel with a laptop bag and often there is no room left in the overhead storage compartments. I blame AC for this as they charge for extra check in luggage forcing its passengers to bring on a second carry on. YMM airport waiting area at gates is unacceptable! Pack 125 people in to an area designed for 50 people - standing room only. I hate flying this route but its the best connection to get home. My biggest complaint has to do with the temperature on the plane it is always way to hot to be comfortable. I always ask them to turn down the heat in the cabin but it hardly changes. What could AC do better? Start by asking for feed back from its customers hand out customer review cards to be collected at the end of a flight. Change the menu to higher quality food. Turn the heat down. Charge for the bathroom (Coin Operated) this would reduce the amount of traffic up and down the aisle just after the ""Fasten Seat Belt"" sign goes out 10 minutes in to the flight.

Air Canada customer review,S Klass,Not Verified,GRU-YYZ-LGA. Checked in online and used the bag drop counter at GRU. Check in staff was super friendly and fast. Boarding the 777 was via stairs after being bussed to the plane according to seat rows. The gate area seemed too small for the 2 big flights leaving was hot and crowded. But that's GRU. Completely full flight. We ended up leaving 50 mins late thanks to passengers who didn't realize the gate change. Once airborne crew set to work quickly with dinner and drinks. Food quality was better than on the outbound from Toronto. Crew worked hard but some without any smiles. Same seat experience as on my outbound. Cushion felt hard and worn so pretty uncomfortable for the long haul. Movie selection didn't seem to have changed from the previous month. Arrived a little late in Toronto went through all the US customs screening etc and found our flight to EWR had been cancelled due to weather. The customer service agent we then dealt with was really just great. Friendly concerned and patient - quickly booked us on an alternate to LGA. She called their baggage people to ensure our bags would be transferred accordingly. This flight was scheduled to depart only about 45 mins later than our original. However after boarding we were informed by the captain that we'd be on the ground for under 3 hours more due to the hold at NY. Not fun after the long overnight. But at least we had gate to gate IFE on the A321 we were on. The movie selection this time was a little different so managed to pass the time. Crew did water runs and handed out cookies while we were parked. They were friendly and very pleasant. We eventually got to LGA as expected 3 hours later with bags delivered very quickly. A long and very tiring trip from start to finish made much more pleasant thanks to the efficiency courtesy of some of Air Canada's staff and crew.,11th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,4,3,4,0,0,4,[],0,17.0,5,3.4,0.0,0.10914814814814816,"['checked', 'online', 'used', 'bag', 'drop', 'counter', 'gru', 'check', 'staff', 'super', 'friendly', 'fast', 'boarding', 'via', 'stairs', 'bussed', 'plane', 'according', 'seat', 'rows', 'gate', 'area', 'seemed', 'small', 'big', 'leaving', 'hot', 'crowded', 'gru', 'completely', 'full', 'ended', 'leaving', 'mins', 'late', 'thanks', 'passengers', 'realize', 'gate', 'change', 'airborne', 'crew', 'set', 'work', 'quickly', 'dinner', 'drinks', 'food', 'quality', 'better', 'outbound', 'crew', 'worked', 'hard', 'smiles', 'seat', 'experience', 'outbound', 'cushion', 'felt', 'hard', 'worn', 'pretty', 'uncomfortable', 'long', 'haul', 'movie', 'selection', 'seem', 'changed', 'previous', 'month', 'arrived', 'little', 'late', 'customs', 'screening', 'etc', 'found', 'ewr', 'cancelled', 'due', 'weather', 'customer', 'service', 'agent', 'dealt', 'really', 'great', 'friendly', 'concerned', 'patient', 'quickly', 'booked', 'alternate', 'lga', 'called', 'baggage', 'people', 'ensure', 'bags', 'transferred', 'accordingly', 'scheduled', 'depart', 'mins', 'later', 'original', 'boarding', 'informed', 'captain', 'ground', 'hours', 'due', 'hold', 'ny', 'fun', 'long', 'overnight', 'least', 'gate', 'gate', 'ife', 'movie', 'selection', 'time', 'little', 'different', 'managed', 'pass', 'time', 'crew', 'water', 'runs', 'handed', 'cookies', 'parked', 'friendly', 'pleasant', 'eventually', 'lga', 'expected', 'hours', 'later', 'bags', 'delivered', 'quickly', 'long', 'tiring', 'trip', 'start', 'finish', 'much', 'pleasant', 'thanks', 'efficiency', 'courtesy', 'staff', 'crew']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Air Canada customer review,P Gill,Not Verified,Frankfurt to Toronto. Positive: Customer service was efficient and courteous spacious clean and comfortable aircraft. Negatives: Horrible food - absolutely atrocious - We were served a hot meal shortly after departure and because the flight was booked they ran out of different meal options so by the time they served the back of the cabin not only was the food cold but we were not given any meal options. Apparently there was a chicken dish available but we were served a disgusting pasta Bolognese dish. The roll was stale and the side was some form of potatoes which had been reconstituted from potato flakes. Apparently others on the flight had similar issues with the chicken dish which tasted like rubber and a salad which had wilted. It was extremely disappointing and I did not eat any of it. Later on we were served Air Canada's 'signature' tortilla/wrap by Monty's which also tasted horrible and is worse than a pizza pocket. The meals and food in general were terrible and I pretty much went the entire flight without eating anything. I hope that Air Canada revamps their meals and offer healthier options instead of meals that look and taste worse than 'TV dinners' or those you would get from a can. I understand that many individuals have varying dietary requirements and allergies but perhaps Air Canada should invest in a dietician or nutritional consultant to encourage healthy eating on the go while meeting the needs of their customers.,6th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,3,4,1,4,0,0,3,[],0,15.0,5,3.0,0.0,-0.14237689393939396,"['frankfurt', 'positive', 'customer', 'service', 'efficient', 'courteous', 'spacious', 'clean', 'comfortable', 'aircraft', 'negatives', 'horrible', 'food', 'absolutely', 'atrocious', 'served', 'hot', 'meal', 'shortly', 'departure', 'booked', 'ran', 'different', 'meal', 'options', 'time', 'served', 'back', 'cabin', 'food', 'cold', 'given', 'meal', 'options', 'apparently', 'chicken', 'dish', 'available', 'served', 'disgusting', 'pasta', 'bolognese', 'dish', 'roll', 'stale', 'side', 'form', 'potatoes', 'reconstituted', 'potato', 'flakes', 'apparently', 'others', 'similar', 'issues', 'chicken', 'dish', 'tasted', 'like', 'rubber', 'salad', 'wilted', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'eat', 'later', 'served', 'monty', 'tasted', 'horrible', 'worse', 'pizza', 'pocket', 'meals', 'food', 'general', 'terrible', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'eating', 'anything', 'hope', 'revamps', 'meals', 'offer', 'healthier', 'options', 'instead', 'meals', 'look', 'taste', 'worse', 'dinners', 'understand', 'many', 'individuals', 'varying', 'dietary', 'requirements', 'allergies', 'perhaps', 'invest', 'dietician', 'nutritional', 'consultant', 'encourage', 'healthy', 'eating', 'meeting', 'needs', 'customers']","['customer', 'review']",neg

Air Canada customer review,S Klass,Not Verified,Newark-Toronto-Sao Paulo. I was impressed with how punctual Air Canada was on these two segments. In fact it was announced at EWR it would be likely we'd even leave early. Arrivals at both points right on time. Onboard cabin in the E190 felt much more comfortable than the 777-200 down to Sao Paulo. Cabin crew were efficient and polite on both sectors though not particularly warm on the longer overnight. Except for the Brazilian crew member who was all smiles and bubbly. Seat cushioning was a little hard and made it hard to sleep comfortably. Service quick meals average. Crew were present throughout the flight with water runs. I liked that there was On demand IFE even on the shorter segment but what isn't fun is how long it takes to fast forward the numerous ads to get to what you actually want to watch.

Air Canada customer review,N Nelson,Not Verified,First trip on Air Canada Rouge Cancun - Toronto October 26. Was interested to see how this new airline looks up close and was surprised at how awful the FA uniforms look in person. The colours are not flattering to any skin or hair colour the bowler hats are ridiculous and they just look downright cheap. The skinny hairbands don't help either. The FA's are very young and void of personality they have no senior co-workers to emulate and it shows. They look lost. They hardly spoke to the passengers and I heard one passenger comment as we left the aircraft that was the quietest flight crew they ever experienced. The aircraft is bare bones the bulkhead doesn't even go up to the ceiling so you are constantly looking into the galley. The seating is so tight a 29 inch pitch it should be illegal in the name of safety. Got off the flight and on to an Air Canada mainline flight to Vancouver. What a difference! The FA's may be older but they look experienced professional and confident and seem to be enjoying their jobs. I guess it's true you get what you pay for and Rouge is paying peanuts to these kids.

Air Canada customer review,M Baya,Not Verified,"Flew to Calgary on Oct 11 with a connecting flight through Vancouver with no major glaring problems. Flights were on time even a bit early. I usually fly with WestJet so I'm used to friendly flight attendants. Boarding this flight was quite a shock. The flight attendant at the front of the plane had a scowl on her face and didn't reply when I greeted her. Later during the in-flight service the same flight attendant asked me if I wanted pretzels. I said ""no no pretzels thank you"" and she didn't offer me a drink at all. I had to her co-worker for a drink and she looked annoyed that I asked. Cleanliness of the cabin was so-so. The floors were clear and there was no garbage in my seat pocket but the window I was sitting next to was coated in what I assume to be facial grease. Delicious. I'm currently preparing for my flights tomorrow and they have both been cancelled and delayed and now I have a layover in Vancouver for several hours. Even though Air Canada is offering other flights to my destination at an earlier time with several available seats they refused to change my flights.

I am short 5 ft 4 and not fluffy and I was cramped the seat in front of me felt like it was only 12 inches away from my face. I can not even think of booking Air Canada rouge for my family to fly anywhere as my hubby and son are over 6 feet tall. If you want food entertainment Wifi or a beer all cost and payable with Credit card. My return flight was an hour and half late with no explanation I had a customs form that needed to be filled out and since we left at 11.45 at night it would of been nice to get that form at the start of the flight not at the end of flight when I was woken up and not had my brain intact.

Air Canada customer review,D Riddell,Not Verified,"Travelled from Vancouver to Asia and back. Transited through Tokyo. In Vancouver the boarding announcements were made in Japanese first followed by Canada's 2 official languages. When I asked at the check in counter they said that the official languages should come first but maybe today was different. Sat in one of the premium seats an exit row seat for more leg room. At 6'3"" and 220 lbs I need it. Headphones did not work so pushed button for attendant. Waited a long time and pushed again. The steward showed up and said ""You need something"" not in a pleasant way but kind of annoyed. Mentioned the problem. He got me another set of headphones they did not work either. His response was to move to another seat and started to walk away as I reminded him that you pay extra for premium seats - he did not care. Service was not good.

Air Canada customer review,N Raven,Not Verified,YVR-LAX mid-day on an Embraer 190. Everything about this flight was smooth and efficient. The plane itself is worthy of comment: smooth powerful yet quiet. The newish light-construction seats were very night and afforded me a lot more foot room. Air Canada's inflight entertainment is the best I have encountered. The service staff were young and correct. The only part of this AC experience that was poor as it has been on other trips is the check-in procedure. It was chaotic with most passengers not certain which queue to join (Check-in Bag Drop Ticketing Self-Check-in) even after they checked themselves in. AC needs to fix this. The fix is easy: have one person out front directing passengers.,22nd October 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,5,0,0,4,[],0,21.0,5,4.2,0.0,0.23563492063492067,"['embraer', 'everything', 'smooth', 'efficient', 'plane', 'worthy', 'comment', 'smooth', 'powerful', 'yet', 'quiet', 'newish', 'seats', 'night', 'afforded', 'lot', 'foot', 'room', 'inflight', 'entertainment', 'best', 'encountered', 'service', 'staff', 'young', 'correct', 'part', 'ac', 'experience', 'poor', 'trips', 'procedure', 'chaotic', 'passengers', 'certain', 'queue', 'join', 'bag', 'drop', 'ticketing', 'checked', 'ac', 'needs', 'fix', 'fix', 'easy', 'person', 'front', 'directing', 'passengers']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,W Foster,Not Verified,"Air Canada Rouge if this is the future for Air Canada someone else better step up to be Canada's national carrier. The only thing about it that is interesting is the paint job. It was the maiden trip to Cancun and I was actually excited to see what all the promotion was. That died off when I tried to sit in my seat. I figure a man at 5' 11"" should be fairly average and thus should be able to fit comfortably. WRONG. The seats are crammed in there there are no electronics in the seats whatsoever so bring a book or be ready to dish out money for old movies or sitcoms. The staff are friendly and polite but some of the 'hip' ways of communicating just don't fit the world of flying. I'm in a plane in the air far above the ocean I want to feel just a touch more professionalism. Air Canada only changed what they had to look at any part of the plane with a touch of detail and you'll see that it's just a gutted plane with very basic changes. The worst part is that by the looks of it Rouge is set to take over more and destinations come 2014.

Air Canada customer review,T Lau,Not Verified,AC9076 Sep 28 2013. I had a business class ticket from Amsterdam to Toronto hub through Frankfurt. This leg of the flight is operated by Air Canada's Star Alliance Partner Lufthansa. Apparently for flights within the EU there is no differentiation between business class versus economy because when boarding time came this was an absolute 'zoo'. No pre-boarding announcement for business class ticket holders and no priority boarding. So my conclusion is that if you're flying within the EU at least on Star Alliance flights they'll take your money for business class but treat you just like 'cattle class'.

Air Canada customer review,P Roberts,Not Verified,"October 14 2013 took flight 847 on 777-300 from Munich to Toronto and then flight 787 from Toronto to Los Angeles later that day. Flight 847 was on a new ""High density"" 777-300 with 10 abreast seats resulting in narrow seats and reduced pitch to 31"". I am 5'10"" tall and 170 lbs and the height that aircraft seats were originally made for. It was impossible to reach down and get things from the floor without getting up and bending over. The price of this flight was not cheaper than others and Air Canada did a bait and switch changing the configuration after I purchased the ticket. The cabin crew did their best . The galley for the 400 seats in economy was very small. The food was almost non-existent. Air Canada has the worst food for an international flight I have had. The second meal was a heated wrap essentially a ""hot pocket"". Inflight entertainment was new system on this plane and was quite good but the second flight had a slow outdated system. Overall service good and AVOD good everything else terrible. Flight 787 was an Airbus A320. Bad AVOD only two bathrooms for economy. Turbulent flight so when not turbulent long lines for lavs. Service Satisfactory everything else not. Hopefully Air Canada will get new 737 MAX equipment with 3 lavs in the rear for these medium haul flights. The Pearson Airport transition with US customs is terrible. Would be better just to have customs in final destination.

Air Canada customer review,S Alex,Not Verified,Air Canada Rouge - Great cabin crew terrible seating space. I flew from Toronto Canada to Varadero Cuba and back. In both directions the cabin crew were excellent and that is where all good about Rouge stops because no matter what these great people do they can not solve issue with lack of space between the seats. Airplane type was A319 and they had 31 raw of seats which basically means no leg room at all. Anyone close or above to 6 feet or 180cm should avoid Rouge flights. Seating pitch on this plane is 29 and this is for flights to Caribbean. After 3.5 hours of flight you will not be able to get out from your seat because of pain in your back and legs. It is so tight between the seats that in my view this is security issue since in case of the emergency people will have extreme difficulties to quickly leave the seat. When it comes to entertainment system there is something called wifi and that has to be paid 10 $ but it did not work so I can say is it worth or not other than this there is no other option. When it comes to food and drinks non alcoholic beverages including coffee and tea are free how ever quantity is limited to one or if you are lucky two drinks at the best.

When we arrived at LGA to check in 3 hours before our flight the AC counter representative forced us to check in at the kiosk even though there was nobody in line at the counter! I usually do the kiosk thing but given we had a lot of luggage our child has a broken arm in a cast and we were tired I just wanted to deal with a live person. She refused to check us in at the counter and instead assisted us at the kiosk. She then told us we couldn't have seats together as the plane was full. Not an ideal scenario travelling with an 8 year old child! She said there was nothing she could do. She scolded me for not having checked in online 24 hours prior.

Air Canada customer review,R Wiegmann,Not Verified,Flew in Business Class from FRA via YYz to BNA. A/C from FRA was a 777 already before take off the crew advised that the IFE was not working. They tried a couple of times to re-start it and finally 2 hours before arrival it got done. Things like that happen but no apologies or compensation was offered for a 6000 USD flight. Food was average to low and the crew was rushing through the service with no smile. Bottle of white wine was clearly open for a while the glass was taken away and after my comment about the bad taste no more wine was offered nice way of solving that problem. Transfer in YYZ was easy and good and shortly after boarding the CRJ for Nashville the plane was grounded for technical issues.

Air Canada customer review,J Thompson,Not Verified,I fly to Greece twice a year and book on a regular flight going through Frankfurt. But in August of this year had the chance to try Air Canada rouge. I paid the same price as a normal flight and got far less than usual. 1) Plane was old and cold. 2) There was no air control system above the seat. 3) Staff were less than friendly. 4) Cold food tea and coffee. 5) Poor entertainment. 6) I had to interrupt a steward using his phone to ask him to put more toilet paper in the bathrooms. 7) I asked for an extra dinner roll as the pasta was terrible I was told they did not know if they had enough to go around even though the flight was not full I never got the dinner roll. 8) The plane was not very clean. 9) Although I paid the same price as a regular flight I still had to pay for wine. I will never fly AC rouge again. My flight home from Athens was a regular flight and I almost felt guilty with the attention I received. The staff are more mature and know how to communicate with customers. They go out of their way to be available at all times. Their presence is comforting.

Air Canada customer review,Pascale Moreau,Not Verified,AC793 Rome-MTL Sep 15th. For the last 12-24 months our many experiences with Air Canada have been nothing but disappointing and far from a world class transporter standard. Both my husband and I are frequent flyers ( I personally take an average of 20 flights a year with Air Canada in North America or Overseas). I don't think it is normal that I have to clean the cabin (remove the cookie crumbs food) off my seat which is filthy stained clean the walls covered with spills and put my blanket on the seat to avoid having to change my clothing when I am heading off to a meeting.

Air Canada customer review,M Steve,Not Verified,YYZ-KIN-YYZ. Flew Air Canada's discount division Rouge to Kingston. Flight was packed on the outbound and boarding was chaotic due to passengers returning with copious purchases and multiple suitcases and carry-ons. Flight attendants are all new hires and so lack most of the basic skills expected of them. I purchased an extra leg room seat in one of the first four rows. Be aware that KIN check in agents will fill these seats with mothers and babies if you think you're getting a bit of respite. For purchase food selection was missing the healthy items inbound and outbound. Return flight was delayed 45 minutes when customer traveling with parent and 7 relatives including 3 newborns had not made proper arrangements for oxygen and crew struggled to deploy the onboard oxygen using FA manuals to sort out the issues. Lost connection meant 3 hour wait and midnight arrival in YOW. Rouge is not Westjet.

Air Canada customer review,R Mortara,Not Verified,YVR-LHR. I decided to return to the UK direct rather than via Europe. Plus points: flight left on time and arrived early even with a short hold before landing. Also Air Canada has a 3x3x3 configuration on its 777-300s rather than the 3x4x3 used by many other airlines. Leg room is ok but I found the seat was getting uncomfortable after a few hours. Other aspects left me wondering how this airline is classed as a 4 star airline. Check-in was quick but with no smiles. Even one of the staff at the gate was almost rude about the darkened spectacles I have to wear. On board one of the cabin attendants shrugged her shoulders when I asked for a blanket their was only a pillow on my seat and she was chewing gum whilst handing out breakfast. At least I did get a blanket after asking one of the other crew members. No hot or cold towels only one drink at a time show how this airline skimps on the things others provide as a norm. The food is poor as well. My special meal was provided but it was tasteless. 'Continental breakfast' comprised a small muffin and a small container of fruit - insufficient for a flight of 9 hours duration. The AVOD was ok with a wide choice available. I may well go to Canada again but will avoid Air Canada.,25th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,2,0,0,3,[],0,11.0,5,2.2,0.0,-0.04479717813051147,"['decided', 'return', 'uk', 'direct', 'rather', 'via', 'europe', 'plus', 'points', 'left', 'time', 'arrived', 'early', 'short', 'hold', 'landing', 'configuration', 'rather', 'used', 'many', 'airlines', 'leg', 'room', 'ok', 'found', 'seat', 'getting', 'uncomfortable', 'hours', 'aspects', 'left', 'wondering', 'airline', 'classed', 'star', 'airline', 'quick', 'smiles', 'staff', 'gate', 'almost', 'rude', 'darkened', 'spectacles', 'wear', 'board', 'cabin', 'attendants', 'shrugged', 'shoulders', 'asked', 'blanket', 'pillow', 'seat', 'chewing', 'gum', 'whilst', 'handing', 'breakfast', 'least', 'blanket', 'asking', 'crew', 'members', 'hot', 'cold', 'towels', 'drink', 'time', 'show', 'airline', 'skimps', 'things', 'others', 'provide', 'norm', 'food', 'poor', 'well', 'special', 'meal', 'provided', 'tasteless', 'breakfast', 'comprised', 'small', 'muffin', 'small', 'container', 'fruit', 'insufficient', 'hours', 'duration', 'avod', 'ok', 'wide', 'choice', 'available', 'may', 'well', 'avoid']","['customer', 'review']",neg
Air Canada customer review,Philip Rubenstein,Not Verified,YYZ-NRT-YVR using B777 / A330 in Executive First. Trip started off nice enough but ended in a cancellation and a forced delay of 1 day. I flew off peak hours so I benefited from a quick check-in with a personable agent. The YYZ-NRT boarding was the usual rush of pax. It would be nice if AC moved the priority lane to one side and it was better labelled so people don't accuse priority boarders of pushing in the line. Not a full flight so FAs had an opportunity to take their time and provide decent service. Food and beverages better than usual and overall I have noticed AC has shown some improvement in its food quality in the past year. Unfortunately the wine selection is still hit and miss. The seat showed its age and was well used. The IFE selection was boring and I resent the forced commercials. It was a good flight and I was able to catch a few hours of sleep. The problem was with the return flight. It was cancelled due to equipment issues. It happens but it seems to be an increasing scenario at AC. The AC response to the issue was disorganized and slow. Personnel tried their best. The end result was hours wasted at the airport until AC sent Pax off to a hotel. Communication was poor. The concierge in NRT was professional although it took some time to get an answer. The lady in YVR who assisted was also professional and kind. Unfortunately the replacement flight the next day was also beset by equipment issues as the air conditioning system wasn't working well and the cabin was stuffy and hot for the flight to YVR. However FAs on this flight were the best I have had on AC. I seem to be encountering an increasing number of equipment issues and delays with AC. I have only recently started using the airline again on my long hauls and I am not particularly impressed by this aspect of its operations.,25th September 2013,,Business Class,,,3,5,3,3,0,0,3,[],0,17.0,5,3.4,0.0,0.052777777777777785,"['using', 'executive', 'first', 'trip', 'started', 'nice', 'enough', 'ended', 'cancellation', 'forced', 'delay', 'day', 'flew', 'peak', 'hours', 'benefited', 'quick', 'personable', 'agent', 'boarding', 'usual', 'rush', 'pax', 'nice', 'ac', 'moved', 'priority', 'lane', 'side', 'better', 'labelled', 'people', 'accuse', 'priority', 'boarders', 'pushing', 'line', 'full', 'fas', 'opportunity', 'take', 'time', 'provide', 'decent', 'service', 'food', 'beverages', 'better', 'usual', 'overall', 'noticed', 'ac', 'shown', 'improvement', 'food', 'quality', 'past', 'year', 'unfortunately', 'wine', 'selection', 'still', 'hit', 'miss', 'seat', 'showed', 'age', 'well', 'used', 'ife', 'selection', 'boring', 'resent', 'forced', 'commercials', 'good', 'able', 'catch', 'hours', 'sleep', 'problem', 'return', 'cancelled', 'due', 'equipment', 'issues', 'happens', 'seems', 'increasing', 'scenario', 'ac', 'ac', 'response', 'issue', 'disorganized', 'slow', 'personnel', 'tried', 'best', 'end', 'result', 'hours', 'wasted', 'airport', 'ac', 'sent', 'pax', 'hotel', 'communication', 'poor', 'concierge', 'nrt', 'professional', 'although', 'took', 'time', 'answer', 'lady', 'yvr', 'assisted', 'professional', 'kind', 'unfortunately', 'replacement', 'day', 'beset', 'equipment', 'issues', 'conditioning', 'system', 'working', 'well', 'cabin', 'stuffy', 'hot', 'yvr', 'fas', 'best', 'ac', 'seem', 'encountering', 'increasing', 'number', 'equipment', 'issues', 'delays', 'ac', 'recently', 'started', 'using', 'airline', 'long', 'hauls', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'aspect', 'operations']","['customer', 'review']",pos

Air Canada customer review,Stephen Brunette,Not Verified,ADB-IST-YYZ-YUL return in economy on 14 August. First flight on Turkish from Izmir code share. Even though a code share flight they couldn't give me my AC boarding passes and told me my luggage would go through to Montreal but I had to check in at AC in Istanbul. Too many people scheduled to be an A320 switched to a A340 at last minute leading to delays leaving Izmir. Arrived in Istanbul we were taken to a remote stand and finally bussed to the domestic terminal. Dashed to the international terminal reps for AC were waiting all smiles and no problems got my two remaining boarding passes. Massive line at immigration control to leave. I went to the front and asked some people if they would let me go ahead as my flight had already started to board. Just made it to my flight to Toronto. Once on board a perfect as a flight in economy could be. Excellent flight attendants professional and friendly. Drinks then a wonderful meal of lamb. Plenty of water runs snack part way through self service drinks and snacks in galley. Another meal 1.5 hrs before landing chicken again excellent. B767 had been refurbished excellent seats comfortable and entertainment system first rate with plenty of choices. Bags didn't make it to YYZ Turkish Airlines fault but AC was very good about getting them to me in Ottawa to my hotel 2 days later. Transfer to YUL smooth good short flight. Return flights again on AC from YUL-YYZ-IST on 23 Aug very good great service by caring crew as outbound. Equipment change again in IST to ADB on THY code share seat changed. Flight short and ok. Overall Air Canada has a great product as I have flown this route over the last 10 years using Turkish Airlines Air France KLM and Lufthansa. The price I paid was cheaper then the rest the flight attendants are what made the difference so nice and accommodating as well as good food for economy. I will keep using AC now that they are flight to IST from Canada.,10th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,[],0,25.0,5,5.0,0.0,0.39046875000000003,"['return', 'economy', 'august', 'first', 'turkish', 'izmir', 'code', 'share', 'though', 'code', 'share', 'give', 'ac', 'boarding', 'passes', 'told', 'luggage', 'montreal', 'check', 'ac', 'istanbul', 'many', 'people', 'scheduled', 'switched', 'last', 'minute', 'leading', 'delays', 'leaving', 'izmir', 'arrived', 'istanbul', 'taken', 'remote', 'stand', 'finally', 'bussed', 'domestic', 'terminal', 'dashed', 'international', 'terminal', 'reps', 'ac', 'waiting', 'smiles', 'problems', 'remaining', 'boarding', 'passes', 'massive', 'line', 'immigration', 'control', 'leave', 'front', 'asked', 'people', 'let', 'ahead', 'already', 'started', 'board', 'board', 'perfect', 'economy', 'excellent', 'attendants', 'professional', 'friendly', 'drinks', 'wonderful', 'meal', 'lamb', 'plenty', 'water', 'runs', 'snack', 'part', 'way', 'self', 'service', 'drinks', 'snacks', 'galley', 'another', 'meal', 'hrs', 'landing', 'chicken', 'excellent', 'refurbished', 'excellent', 'seats', 'comfortable', 'entertainment', 'system', 'first', 'rate', 'plenty', 'choices', 'bags', 'make', 'yyz', 'turkish', 'airlines', 'fault', 'ac', 'good', 'getting', 'hotel', 'days', 'later', 'transfer', 'yul', 'smooth', 'good', 'short', 'return', 'ac', 'aug', 'good', 'great', 'service', 'caring', 'crew', 'outbound', 'equipment', 'change', 'ist', 'adb', 'thy', 'code', 'share', 'seat', 'changed', 'short', 'ok', 'overall', 'great', 'product', 'flown', 'route', 'last', 'years', 'using', 'turkish', 'airlines', 'france', 'klm', 'lufthansa', 'price', 'paid', 'cheaper', 'rest', 'attendants', 'difference', 'nice', 'accommodating', 'well', 'good', 'food', 'economy', 'keep', 'using', 'ac', 'ist']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,O Perera,Not Verified,Flew from Toronto to Sydney on 7th September. Flight left Toronto at 8.25pm. We were in transit in Vancouver which was 4.5 hrs flying. What we were offered for dinner when we boarded in Toronto was a snack which had to be paid. Then when we arrived in Vancouver all our cabin luggage had to be taken with us and reboard the same plane to the same seats. This was really inconvenient from the passengers point of view. By the time we were served a proper meal was 2.30am Toronto time. Toronto to Sydney just the flying time was 20 hrs. That kind of a meal service for such a long flight is not acceptable.,10th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,3,0,0,3,[],0,14.0,5,2.8,0.0,-0.00625,"['flew', 'september', 'left', 'transit', 'hrs', 'flying', 'offered', 'dinner', 'boarded', 'snack', 'paid', 'arrived', 'cabin', 'luggage', 'taken', 'reboard', 'plane', 'seats', 'really', 'inconvenient', 'passengers', 'point', 'view', 'time', 'served', 'proper', 'meal', 'time', 'flying', 'time', 'hrs', 'kind', 'meal', 'service', 'long', 'acceptable']","['customer', 'review']",neg
Air Canada customer review,M Gordon,Not Verified,YVR-YOW-YVR. Breakfast flight to Ottawa on an Airbus 320. I had breakfast in the AC lounge and it was good the wireless needs to be upgraded as it was very slow and the YVR wireless was much faster. Our FA on the flight was very attentive and the breakfast service was excellent. Delayed 45 minutes landing in Ottawa due to a thunderstorm. On my return journey I enjoyed my stay in the lounge with good food and a glass of quality wine but again the wireless was slow and I gave up using it. The return flight was an Airbus 319. There was only one FA with us in the front cabin and she did the best she could being short handed with a full cabin. She was friendly and otherwise I enjoyed my trip. The meal was excellent and she offered a special liqueur service which was appreciated by many in the front cabin. My other suggestion is that on the IFE you get more documentaries old comedy TV shows and classic films. These must be reasonably inexpensive. Because I travel so much with them I sometimes run out of choices. However for both I paid an executive class fare and I got good value for what I paid.,9th September 2013,,Business Class,,,5,4,5,4,0,0,5,[],0,23.0,5,4.6,0.0,0.339569597069597,"['breakfast', 'airbus', 'breakfast', 'ac', 'lounge', 'good', 'wireless', 'needs', 'upgraded', 'slow', 'yvr', 'wireless', 'much', 'faster', 'fa', 'attentive', 'breakfast', 'service', 'excellent', 'delayed', 'minutes', 'landing', 'due', 'thunderstorm', 'return', 'journey', 'enjoyed', 'stay', 'lounge', 'good', 'food', 'glass', 'quality', 'wine', 'wireless', 'slow', 'gave', 'using', 'return', 'airbus', 'fa', 'front', 'cabin', 'best', 'short', 'handed', 'full', 'cabin', 'friendly', 'otherwise', 'enjoyed', 'trip', 'meal', 'excellent', 'offered', 'special', 'liqueur', 'service', 'appreciated', 'many', 'front', 'cabin', 'suggestion', 'ife', 'documentaries', 'old', 'comedy', 'tv', 'shows', 'classic', 'films', 'must', 'reasonably', 'inexpensive', 'travel', 'much', 'sometimes', 'run', 'choices', 'paid', 'executive', 'class', 'fare', 'good', 'value', 'paid']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,Jane Coney,Not Verified,19th Aug London to Toronto. Flight was fine though staff seemed too few and too busy to deal with passengers. The next leg 5 days later we checked in for online Toronto to Los Angeles we were asked to pay for our cases to check in $75 not expected. The flight though was very poor. Our return trip on the 2 Sep from LA to Toronto was just as bad but the Toronto to London was the worst. Too many people getting on with oversized bags and being allowed too plane was very over crowded. also our inflight entertainment wasn't working in any of our 3 seats the staff just shrugged their shoulders and handed out contact details for customer service. The plane was old and dirty we will not be using Air Canada again.,9th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,0,0,2,[],0,7.0,5,1.4,0.0,-0.12717948717948718,"['aug', 'fine', 'though', 'staff', 'seemed', 'busy', 'deal', 'passengers', 'leg', 'days', 'later', 'checked', 'online', 'los', 'angeles', 'asked', 'pay', 'cases', 'check', 'expected', 'though', 'poor', 'return', 'trip', 'sep', 'la', 'bad', 'worst', 'many', 'people', 'getting', 'oversized', 'bags', 'allowed', 'plane', 'crowded', 'inflight', 'entertainment', 'working', 'seats', 'staff', 'shrugged', 'shoulders', 'handed', 'contact', 'details', 'customer', 'service', 'plane', 'old', 'dirty', 'using']","['customer', 'review']",neg
Air Canada customer review,F Hryn,Not Verified,YXE-YYZ-DUB-CPH CPH-YYZ-YXE in economy. Paid an excellent price for this route. Flight to Toronto uneventful good service flights on time. Air Canada is my first choice for transatlantic flying but after 2 flights in my itinerary I will definitely reconsider especially the one to Dublin. It's not that the flight was uncomfortable the entire experience was just average. Flight attendants seemed uninterested and the plane was probably the oldest in the fleet. The arm rest of my seat had something that looked like industrial-strength foil holding parts together. I think this flight is over-looked since it is a seasonal route. This route is also being transferred to Rouge next year so maybe it'll improve. CPH-YYZ absolutely no problem newer aircraft friendly flight crew. Boarding at CPH was somewhat interesting - over 200 people left to sit in the hallway and departure lounge only opened shortly before boarding. YYZ-YXE late leaving YYZ due to an issue with the cargo door. No problem - safety first.

Air Canada customer review,Em Vittorio,Not Verified,I flew YYZ-WAW with a stop in FRA. The YYZ-FRA portion was operated by an AC 777-300 aircraft. This was on July 23 2013. I was happy with the service I received. I did on-line check-in and printed my boarding pass prior to arriving at the airport. To print my baggage tags I went to the check-in kiosk but the kiosk unfortunately did not want to print out all my tags meaning I could not go to the quick express bag-drop queue. This wasn't really a problem though because as a Star Alliance Gold customer I can use the quick Executive Class check-in queue to drop off my baggage. Check-in agent Heather was very nice and friendly! She actually gave me individual attention to the fact that my baggage should be labelled as fragile. I then went past security and with a friend I went to the Maple Leaf / Star Alliance Gold lounge. Lounge had a calming and not too busy atmosphere very pleasant and recommended! The flight itself was great! Cabin crew were attentive (although not the very friendliest AC cabin crew I have encountered but still very good) and the in-flight entertainment options were actually I think the best part of the flight. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal came quickly and in general it was a good flight!,8th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,5,0,0,5,[],0,22.0,5,4.4,0.0,0.3492934782608696,"['flew', 'stop', 'fra', 'portion', 'operated', 'ac', 'aircraft', 'july', 'happy', 'service', 'received', 'printed', 'boarding', 'pass', 'prior', 'arriving', 'airport', 'print', 'baggage', 'tags', 'kiosk', 'kiosk', 'unfortunately', 'want', 'print', 'tags', 'meaning', 'quick', 'express', 'queue', 'really', 'problem', 'though', 'star', 'alliance', 'gold', 'customer', 'use', 'quick', 'executive', 'class', 'queue', 'drop', 'baggage', 'agent', 'heather', 'nice', 'friendly', 'actually', 'gave', 'individual', 'attention', 'fact', 'baggage', 'labelled', 'fragile', 'past', 'security', 'friend', 'maple', 'leaf', 'star', 'alliance', 'gold', 'lounge', 'lounge', 'calming', 'busy', 'atmosphere', 'pleasant', 'recommended', 'great', 'cabin', 'crew', 'attentive', 'although', 'friendliest', 'ac', 'cabin', 'crew', 'encountered', 'still', 'good', 'entertainment', 'options', 'actually', 'think', 'best', 'part', 'vegetarian', 'meal', 'came', 'quickly', 'general', 'good']","['customer', 'review']",pos
Air Canada customer review,N McCrohan,Not Verified,AC 895 Dublin Ireland to Toronto. Good check in staff. Flight on time. Booked Air Canada ahead of other airlines. Expected good service as the National Carrier but was very disappointed. Food not up to much and cabin crew did not make much of an effort. They seemed quite bored. Return flight AC894 Fast check in and very courteous. Flight was awful due to weather conditions. Food very boring and small portions. Breakfast was a slice of banana bread and juice / tea / coffee.

Air Canada customer review,Carole Ruxton,Not Verified,Flight on 22nd August 2013 Dublin to Toronto and return on 30th August. Cabin crew very grumpy. Food okay on outward journey. Films okay. Interior of cabin grubby. Wasn't expecting that from AC. Return journey encountered bad weather food service was delayed a considerable time due to safety issues so when it finally arrived it was hardly palatable. I noticed a lot of unfinished meals going back. Banana bread for breakfast hardly constitutes a meal. Toilets were very grubby and towel bin held closed with masking tape which eventually fell down.

Air Canada customer review,S Paice,Not Verified,LHR-Toronto-LHR. Day flight from Heathrow wasn't too bad. Check-in painless lounge ok although the time from 'go to gate' to 'closing' in departures is ridiculously short. Inflight meal was ok - child's meal was well received adult's meal perfectly ok and served promptly with additional drinks available on request. Only downside was the bassinet wasn't available. IFE ok when it worked although it needed re-booted at least 3 times. Return flight. Check in at Toronto an utter shambles check in online but to get to bag drop you need to print out all your bag tags. This would be fine but their system can't cope with a booking including an infant. Thankfully the desk agent took pity on us and printed them out. Toronto lounge pleasant. Inflight pretty terrible. AC seem to persist with ancient aircraft without winglets so turbulence is amplified meaning the seat belt light on most of the trip. No food service during 'turbulence' so meal service took hours and the lights were left on so neither of the children (or us) slept at all. Asked for lights to be dimmed and 'we can't dim them' was the reply. Didn't get a drink before food due to the apparent turbulence cutting short the drink run and the never came back until 'breakfast'. At least I got dinner eventually unlike the poor folk at the back who waited at least 3 hours. 'Breakfast' was a slice of banana bread and the kids got a bran muffin. Asked for a diet coke to try and wash it down got 2 fingers worth and some ice. Pointless and not at all filling. AC would have been better with a light snack for dinner (given we took off at 10pm) and a decent breakfast. Some of the staff were quite friendly and chatty but it couldn't describe a truly miserable flight. I could only really describe it as 'United in disguise' expected far better from AC.
