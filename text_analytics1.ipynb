       "'Hi Pat:You forgot the Chrysler Sebring   I\\'m sure some folks would appreciate having the Malibu included as well.  You can try to revive this topic but without being able to discuss (however heated the discussion gets..or not) manufacturer verses manufacturer or model verses model (as in making comparisons) or issues with a specific manufacturer there is little to talk about. I do agree about issues with other members/posters however in spite of being guilty of doing just that.  Model vs. model is exactly what we\\'re here for! Manufacturer vs. manufacturer belongs elsewhere as I\\'ve noted a number of times. There were many times we were turning the previous discussion into conversations that were/are already occurring in Auto News and they were happening to the exclusion of the vehicles themselves. That\\'s what we need to avoid this time around.  The Altima is my favorite of the bunch. It is amongst the fastest and best handling of the group, is priced well, and has all the gadgets. The 2007 model is the best looker of the bunch, IMO. My second choice is the Ford Fusion. The things I don\\'t like about it is the lack of punch, and it is gadget-free compared to the Altima. It is still fun to drive and is very nice looking inside and out, though. I hate the Camry\\'s interior, and the Accord\\'s seats. The Camry also feels a lot slower than its HP rating suggests, and the Nissan\\'s motor wails on the Accord\\'s whiny V6. Both Camry and Accord are kind of expensive for what you get. The Aura looks neat, but I\\'ve never driven one so I can\\'t comment. The Mazda needs to be replaced. Not a bad car, but generationally it feels like a 2002 car and not 2007. I\\'ll take the host\\'s advice and spare any comments on the Hyundai and Kia.   What do you think of the CVT in the Altima? I\\'ve heard some people say that it feels slow off the line even though it\\'s not.  Buick LaCrossePassat(Audi A6 in non-lux trim)Volvo S40(not really a luxury car, either, and not sporty like the S60)Jeep Compass(hard to tell if it\\'s a car or a SUV wanna-be)Plus a few others, like the RX-8 and such that are technically sedans(a few two door sedans and hatchbacks would also qualify, IMO, if it\\'s the only way they come)P.S. the CVT in the Altima has to be driven like a motorcycle. You need to floor the pedal until you reach the speed you want and ease off. Very binary behavior - and the opposite of a normal transmission. If you ease into it progressively harder, like you are used to, it accelerates like your grandmother.  I have actually driven the CVT, and honestly it felt faster \"seat of my pants\" than any other car in this list did (of the ones I\\'ve driven). I didn\\'t even notice the lack of shifting, I was having so much fun driving it. My daily driver is an \\'03 Maxima, and the \\'07 Altima does feel faster than the Max, though not by a ridiculous amount. It\\'s pretty clear to me that the new Altima is the true successor to my car, and not the \"redesigned\" \\'04 and up Maximas.  I wouldn\\'t consider the RX-8, G35 coupe, or Saturn ION coupe to be midsized, no matter how many doors they have. I don\\'t think the S40 is midsized either, being the same size as a Mazda3 or Focus.I think since \"sedans\" is in the title, the Compass (which is too small to be midsized anyway), wagons shouldn\\'t count, gloried as a wanna-be SUV or not.  My daily driver is an \\'03 Maxima, and the \\'07 Altima does feel faster than the Max, though not by a ridiculous amount. It\\'s pretty clear to me that the new Altima is the true successor to my car, and not the \"redesigned\" \\'04 and up Maximas.Its interesting how that happens. There is no real successor to the Contour, and I think the Mazda6 (V6/MTX) is the closest thing available from Ford.I personally found the Altima to be great looking but a bit pricey.  P.S. the CVT in the Altima has to be driven like a motorcycle. You need to floor the pedal until you reach the speed you want and ease off. Very binary behavior - and the opposite of a normal transmission. If you ease into it progressively harder, like you are used to, it accelerates like your grandmother. Heh, maybe that\\'s why I didn\\'t notice a problem with the CVT. Typically, in rush hour traffic you don\\'t really notice it, but when I\\'m going up an entrance ramp, for example, I will point the Maxima in the direction it needs to go, give it just a bit of gas so I don\\'t spin the tires, and ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM. It\\'s a lot like an airplane turning onto a runway for takeoff. That\\'s how I drove the Altima, and the CVT must be a pretty good match for my driving style. I see people driving Maximas and Altimas like Buicks, and just shake my head. It\\'s like, why didn\\'t you just save $10k and buy an Impala?? They\\'re four door sports cars, and I have the insurance tab to prove it (despite having zero accidents or tickets in my 15 years of driving).  Its interesting how that happens. There is no real successor to the Contour, and I think the Mazda6 (V6/MTX) is the closest thing available from Ford. I personally found the Altima to be great looking but a bit pricey. I really, really like the Fusion. More than the Contour, that\\'s for sure! I just couldn\\'t get over the Fusion\\'s lack of power compared to what I was used to, and could Ford put any more basic of a stereo into that car?? The car drove VERY well, and I really liked the interior/exterior of the thing. I suspect that when I go to replace my Maxima in a few years, I will get sticker shock. I got a tremendous deal on it since the redesigned \\'04s were like 2 weeks out, and the dealer wanted to get rid of the \\'03s BADLY. The Altimas are much more popular cars, and I\\'m sure my discount won\\'t be nearly as nice. Then again, maybe I will be able to swing a G35 by the time my Maxima needs replacing. :shades:  What do you think of the CVT in the Altima? I\\'ve heard some people say that it feels slow off the line even though it\\'s not. depends how you drive it. Its computer controlled with 300 or so algorithms progamed into it. It kind of adapts to you. Personaly, I think it\\'s incredible. But, you don\\'t need to \"stomp\" on the gas to get it to go. durring the break-in period, I found myself having to watch the RPM\\'s so as not to go over the 4000 the owners manual says to stay under. If you were to give it full acceleration, you\\'d go over 5000 rpm\\'s and hit 60 mph in about 6 or 7 seconds. But, because it\\'s so damn smooth and quiet, it doesn\\'t feel like its moving that fast. But a quick look in the rear view, will show you how fast it\\'s actually going. But in addition to that, you get much better acceleration at higher speeds, and it will employ engine braking on it\\'s own when going down a steep incline. It deffinitly takes a couple hundred miles to get used too, but the CVT is undoubtly the future of transmissions. look for everybody to swithch to them in the next 5 years or so. The cvt will do to automatic transmissions what fuel injection did to carburators.  The LaCrosse is a step up from the mid-sized sedans in this group. The Passat should qualify. The S40 is a compact car, on the Mazda3 platform. The Jeep Compass is a cross-over SUV. You would probably get laughed out of the Jeep dealership if you called it a \"mid-sized sedan.\"I agree with other posters that the Malibu should certainly be mentioned in the banner of this discussion, and DC should be represented by the Sebring at least, if not by its Dodge cousin (even though I personally think they are woeful vehicles).  Our 2 person business jsut bought it\\'s second Sonata. The \\'05 is GLS \"special value\" (an LX without leather or power seat). The \\'07 is an SE w/XM and floor mats. A couple less features, but a lot more safety features and some additonal goodies. My brother drives the \\'07 and almost everyday remarks about this feature or that, the power, the comfort, gas milage, etc. He says, \"Beats the (stuff) out of the \\'94 Olds 98 all around.\" Better everything. His nose was down on Sonata unti I made him take one for a test drive. Everyone in he mid-sized market should consider Sonata. Sonata has come a long way since it was first introduced, how ever many years ago?  what started this HP war in family sedans?? and where its going to stop. The Fusion which has the lowest HP/torque ratings in this class still does 0-60 in 7.0 seconds. Not bad for what is supposed to be a \"family sedan\"?? Bragging rights is what manufacturers are after. My family sedan can do 0-60 in 4.8 seconds.. for me, so what? I would be willing to bet most of us are stuck in traffic that doesn\\'t go much more than 60mph.. I look for value/content when looking at a vehicle. I want more safety, more comfort, more substance for my $$.. Nice to see this room finally open by the way..   I have read one or two comments here about the Aura and they were that the writer hadn\\'t driven one.I have had my Aura XR for about a month now. My first GM car since 1972 (Vega Kahmback  )I am very impressed with the car in every aspect I buy a car for. I can only compare it here to the Chevy Impala and Malibu. I was within a day or two of buying a Chevy when I read about the 2007 Car of the Year. When I read about the Cadillac 3.6 L V6 producing 252 H-P and 252 Ft/lb of torque I was interested. Then I read it was connected to a 6 speed auto with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. I knew I had to drive one before I bought a chevy.One drive and I knew this was a way better car than the Malibu or Impala with either of the Chevy V6\\'s 3.5 or 3.9 L engines. The Chevy\\'s don\\'t have Traction control, Stability control or half as many air bags as the Aura. So I was most impressed with the ride, handling, and the Oh My God acceleration. (hold on tight when you punch the 3.6 as the torque-steer will just about yank the steering wheel out of your hands.Ok! I lied, this was a nickels worth :shades:  Is the horsepower of todays cars that different than the massive V8 horsepower wars of 30-45 years ago, really? I mean, if cars can have 260+ horsepower and have 2008 revised fuel economy estimates in the mid 20s combined like the Camry does, where is the problem? Bring on the power if the economy comes with it, I say. Apparently, power matters to some people, or they wouldn\\'t get the V6 models. Personally, I drive the I4, since economy matters to me.It has more safety content than the Ford you chose, interestingly. You value different things however, so the Ford was right for you obviously.Here is a rundown of 2007 model vehicles with the new 2008 EPA estimates, for everyone\\'s reference (all automatics):Chevy Malibu 2.2L I4 - 21/31Chevy Malibu 3.5L V6 - 19/30Chevy Malibu 3.9L V6 - 16/23Ford Fusion 2.3L I4 - 20/29Ford Fusion 3.0L V6 - 18/26Honda Accord 2.4L I4 - 21/31Honda Accord 3.0L V6 - 18/26Hyundai Sonata 2.4L I4 - 21/30Hyundai Sonata 3.3L V6 - 18/27Kia Optima 2.4L I4 - 21/31Kia Optima 2.7L V6 - 20/28Mazda 6 2.3L I4 - 21/28Mazda 6 3.0L V6 - 17/25Mitsubishi Galant 2.4L I4 - 20/27Mitsubishi Galant 3.8L V6 - 16/25Nissan Altima 2.5L I4 - 23/31Nissan Altima 3.5L V6 - 20/26Toyota Camry 2.4L I4 - 21/30Toyota Camry 3.5L V6 - 19/28I left out some models (this took awhile!) but for more info, check out fueleconomy.gov  SO cool, Post number 20 in room 2.0!! The last room had soo many posts and problems!! GREAT JOB PAT!But back on topic, Y is it that the ford fusion and mazda 6 use many of the same parts and the same engine blocks but their MPG isn\\'t the same? Maybe aerodynamics?I hope the next 6(26) gets the 3.5lv6, 6speed auto, and AWD across the line. I also hope the fusion gets these changes. Hopefully, Ford is working on better 4cyl engines so the Fusion can be higer in the MPG ranks! or Diesels... While somewhat on the subject of MPG, i cant wait until VW puts the new 2l diesel engine in the passat!! I\\'m really getting into this diesel thing!-Cj   Y is it that the ford fusion and mazda 6 use many of the same parts and the same engine blocks but their MPG isn\\'t the same? Maybe aerodynamics? It could be that (though it would seem to me the Mazda6 would then get the better rating). Rounding may exaggerate differences. If two cars are measured at 29.4 and 29.6 mpg, one gets a rating of 29 and the other 30.I think I have read that there are some differences in the tuning of the engines and maybe in the heads, also.  I hope the next 6(26) gets the 3.5lv6, 6speed auto, and AWD across the line.Oh I definitely hope not. The bigger V6 is great, but its one of the few midsizers with a manual transmission (although a 6 speed manual like the MazdaSpeed6 would be fine with me) and not everyone wants or needs the weight and fuel economy penalty associated with AWD.If you are looking for a powerful AWD midsized sedan, I would look at a Legacy GT.  I saw a report in my local paper yesterday that noted a Motor Trend story (not yet on their web site) about the new Mazda6. It said the styling would be daring, with the roof swept back behind the driver for a sleek look even if it takes away rear head room. Looking around the web, there is general consensus that tne new 6 will be considerably bigger (for more rear leg room) and more powerful than the current model, with the Ford 3.5L V6. I would like to see it get an economical I4 with decent power and a 6-speed stick in the low-end trim line.   It said the styling would be daring, with the roof swept back behind the driver for a sleek look even if it takes away rear head room. Looking around the web, there is general consensus that tne new 6 will be considerably bigger (for more rear leg room) Maybe I am not understanding this, but it doesn\\'t sound right. Tall people sitting in the back seat will have more leg room, and less head room. I guess they will have to slouch a lot huh? :confuse:  I am struggling with the trend to make everything bigger. The Civic is about the same size as my old Accord (although heavier), the Accord is bigger than the 80s Crown Vics. I don\\'t need a mile between the front and back seat, I just need room for a carseat or 2, and that is only occasionally.Even BMW did it, now they are talking about a 1-series that will be about as big as an E30.  I have been driving Accords for 16 years now. 12 years with the first one, and 4 years (with many more to come) on the second. The Accord, despite being a 5 year old design, competes or beats cars that are completely new designs. Some competitors have more hp, and some even have better fuel economy, but the Accord\\'s total package is hard to beat. The attention to detail, keeps the Accord at the top of the heap. Tight build quality, great ergonomics, smooth ride, confident handling, smooth drivetrains, and good power in I4 or V6 versions add up to a car that does everything very well. If you are looking to buy a midsize sedan, I highly recommend the Accord. I have to warn you that this car could spoil you, and you will not be able to consider another brand again.   the Accord is bigger than the 80s Crown Vics.Maybe inside, yeah. At 6\\'4\", my 2006 Accord is the smallest/most efficient new car I could comfortably drive. I hope they keep the efficiency and grow the interior room, personally. The Civic does have similar room inside with my 1996 Accord. Weighs about the same too (2,800 lbs or so).  I guess we\\'ll have to see the new Mazda6 to see what the rear seat accomodations are like, but what I\\'d expect is that, if they use a swept-back roofline but a longer wheelbase, they could mount the rear seat low (ala Civic or Prius) and still have enough head room--albeit maybe not class-leading headroom.  the Accord is bigger than the 80s Crown Vics.In what way?Not in Passenger Volume:2007 Accord = 103 ft3 1985 Crown Vic = 111 ft3But, yes these mid size cars are big enough, already.  I am struggling with the trend to make everything bigger.I think this is an American thing. We seem to be living longer, and growing larger. I am a few inches taller, and a few pounds heavier than my father. Most of my friends seem to be larger than their parents too. If you are one of us, you appreciate the interior space. If you don\\'t feel the need for more space, I still don\\'t see the problem. If you would be content will the space of say a 96 Accord, you can get that from the current Civic. The 96 Altima is probably about the same size as the current Sentra. As we Americans get larger and larger, our cars are growing with us.  not always. the 07 altima is a few inches smaller than the 06. But, it\\'s just a simple matter of affluence. bigger, in some cases, is better. a larger car offers more room and hence, more comfort. especially for people with a family. As people become wealthier, the larger and more expensive cars become affordable for them. Most people tend to buy as much car as they can afford.It was one of the primary reasons I bought my altima. The wife and kids fit in it better than the 4 door civic she drives. I still drive my 2 door coupe to and from work because of the better MPG, but for the family car, I wanted bigger.  Nobody I know of has mentioned this, but could Nissan be trying to differentiate the Altima and Maxima a little bit better with the size difference (Altima made smaller)?  I doubt it. although the altima is smaller this year, It isn\\'t by much. Just an inch or two. In contrast, it appears to me, that nissan isn\\'t trying to differentiate the two. A fully loaded 3.5sl altima isn\\'t that different from a max.  Nissan is differentiating the Altima from the Maxima in several ways:* Price: Altima starts around $20k, several thousand less than the Maxima.* Powertrains: Altima has I4, V6, and hybrid powertrains available; Maxima is V6 only.* Content: Altima is positioned as a family sedan, although a sporty one; Maxima is positioned as a near-luxury sedan, with a more upscale interior and features like the sky roof.* Models: Altima is available (soon) as a sedan and a coupe; Maxima is a sedan only.   Interestingly, with the refreshed Maxima and the new Altima, i\\'ve pointed out to my friends \"look, a new Altima\" by looking at the fascia, only to be mistaken that it the car I was seeing was actually a revised Maxima, so you may have a point jd10013.  not always. the 07 altima is a few inches smaller than the 06. The 07 Altima is shorter, but it is also wider. The few inches shorter probably didn\\'t cause the car to loose any leg room, but the few inches wider probably helped with hip room. Without checking the figures, I bet the interior volume increased, rather than decreased, despite the body dimensions.  I just read in my Dec. 2006 issue of Motor Trend about the poor amount of headroom for anyone over 6\\', as well as the backseat being \"skimpy for the class.\" The trunk is overly massive however, at 18 cu.ft.The previous Altima was noted for a nice large interior, IIRC.  Nah, the car has plenty of room. at least equal to others in its class. I\\'m not saying this as a nissan homer (which I am) but the \\'07 is by far the best, and most complete altima nissan has made. It\\'s probably still a notch below the accord, but I\\'d also put it slight bit better than the camry, and the mazda6. The rest, IMHO, are quite a few notches below those four.  I had the opportunity to compare the Altima and Versa side-by-side at my local auto show recently. When the driver\\'s seat was adjusted for my 5\\'10\" frame, the Versa had noticeably more legroom than the Altima. Part of that was because the Versa had lots of foot space under the driver\\'s seat, moreso than the Altima.Every review I\\'ve read on the new Altima notes its reduced rear legroom compared to the prior generation. Not that the legroom is unacceptable for a mid-sized sedan (not nearly as crasmped as the Mazda6 or Legacy, for example), but it\\'s no longer at or near the top of the class in that regard.  I guess we have a different concept of \"cramped\". My 6 foot son is able to sit behind 5\\'11\" me in my Mazda 6, without feeling \"cramped\".This is why these cars keep getting bigger and bigger. The perfectly adequate (to me) Mazda6 is called \"too small\" and \"cramped\". I read the same complaints about the Contour, which was a little tight, but the back seat was usable and at least set at a comfotable height. Those who criticized that car\\'s rear seat, apparently were unaware that Ford made the Taurus and Crown Vic for those wanting a more spacious back seat.  Everyone\\'s legs are different. I know for example that the Mazda6 has less rear leg room than my previous-gen Elantra, a compact car. I would not reject the Mazda6 only because of its rear leg space, as I think it\\'s adequate (barely) for my needs, but my point is that most mid-sized cars have more interior volume and rear-seat space than the Mazda6. Even the current-gen compact Elantra has more of both. When I pay for a mid-sized car, I\\'d like mid-sized room. Otherwise I may as well buy a compact and save the extra bucks.  Altima notes its reduced rear legroom compared to the prior generation.Yes, it is a little less, but fairly negligable. It was the rear headroom that was hit hardest because of the slopping roofline, though it will still comforably fit people under about 6\\'2. But the aim for the 07 redesign wasn\\'t to lead the class in leg, head, or overall room. It was to be the best handling front wheel drive sedan on the road. Wheather or not it sucseeded is pretty subjective, but with the near elimination of torque steer, fastest 0-60 time ect, its by far the best performing altima yet. And, deffintly equal to, if not better, than the competition.  I know for example that the Mazda6 has less rear leg room than my previous-gen ElantraNot according to measurements reported in CR and listed here on Edmunds. Both indicate that Elantra had 1.5 inches less rear leg room than the Mazda6 does.  bigger, in some cases, is better. a larger car offers more room and hence, more comfort.I don\\'t see the Space = Comfort thing. Grippy supportive seats, properly spaced accelerator, brake, and clutch, short to moderate throws on the shifter, and a relatively small diameter grippy wheel = driving comfort for me.I also accept that I am not a typical consumer. I really wish I was; I wish I didn\\'t care about how cars feel or driving dynamics and I could just get the Accord or Taurus or something and be done with it. I am sure eventually I will get old and have some 3 hour 30 mile each way commute like everyone else and I won\\'t care. Oh well.   I wish I didn\\'t care about how cars feel or driving dynamics and I could just get the Accord or Taurus or something and be done with it. Us Accord drivers do care about driving dynamics. Which is why we don\\'t drive Camrys or Buicks. Of course driving dynamics aren\\'t everything. I want to be comfortable, even on long trips. And \"Fun to drive\" is nice, on occasion, but how aggressive can you get with a family car, with the family in it? Since I don\\'t pull big G-forces around corners every day, I want a balance of handling and comfort.  Of course driving dynamics aren\\'t everything.I might disagree with that statement. This is how vehicles differentiate themselves.I want a balance of handling and comfort.I totally agree with this statement. That \"balance\" is very subjective. Vehicles like the E36 3-series had a great balance, it was very sporty and handled very well and absorbed bumps and expansion joints very nicely, and this was over 10 years ago.The amount of time this vehicle will have more than 1 occupant is mayyyybeee 20%. That one occupant is neither tall nor hefty. The commute is an easy 20-30 minute drive with light traffic. Almost every other vehicle I\\'ve had has been able to get me to school or work or both and back, and been an entertaining autocross or HPDE companion.As I said before, I realize I am not a typical consumer, but I do need 4 doors, 5 seatbelts, 3 pedals and room for a couple of car seats. Perhaps I should go down a size class and look there.  According to my experience actually sitting in both cars, I have more rear seat leg room in my \\'04 Elantra.The published measurements can be deceiving. They do not take into account seat height and contouring, and toe space. So one car may have, by the numbers, more rear seat leg room but not feel as spacious as another car with lower numbers.So I always do a \"sit test\" when shopping for cars, and don\\'t just depend on the numbers.   Almost every other vehicle I\\'ve had has been able to get me to school or work or both and back, and been an entertaining autocross or HPDE companion.No midsize car is designed for that. Not even a 6.As I said before, I realize I am not a typical consumer, but I do need 4 doors, 5 seatbelts, 3 pedals and room for a couple of car seats. Perhaps I should go down a size class and look there.Seems to me what you need is one of those off-road-rally type cars, not a midsize sedan. I\\'ve watched a few of those races. Don\\'t they use cars like the Mitsu Lancer, or a small Subaru? Something lighter, and more nimble than a Mazda 6.  the space=comfort thing is more for the passengers. As others have said, the altima, accord, camry, fussion, ect are family cars.But I know where your coming from. Its why I decided to keep my coupe instead of tradding it in when I bought my altima.   Sometimes I will drive somewhere 5-600 miles just because I enjoy driving. But the car has to be comfortable, and easy to drive. I drove to northern Arkansas (700 miles) to visit my sister once in a pickup truck. That was not enjoyable, at all. Never again, I couldn\\'t wait to get home. I need something easy to drive and comfortable. Considering I\\'ve had back surgery for two ruptured disks in my lower back, lumbar support is also a necessity.  I remember that you are very big on Honda and down on the Sonata. Have you driven an \\'07 Sonata? It seems to have everything you want in a car and more. If you haven\\'t tried it, you might be very pleasantly surprized. My brother got a new Sonata the end of Feb. He was amazed at the stability control and traction control on two different snowy days. He wasn\\'t sure what was happening, at first, just that the car did what he was intending it to do.  No, I have not driven a Sonata. I have driven Camrys, and from what I\\'ve heard the Sonata is patterned after the Camry, and has many of the same dynamics. I have driven a new Optima (don\\'t know how similar they are), and was not impressed with the driver\\'s seat (or much else). It reminded me of the thinly padded seat in my old Nissan Sentra work car. Honda has a reputation that I trust. I could spend my $$$ on it, knowing I would be satisfied. Hyundai is something I would be taking a chance on, and I am not a risk taker. As far as the snow thing, in south Louisiana we may get snow once every 20 years (I am 44 years old, and have seen snow here twice, and maybe an inch or two).  Of course the Buick LaCrosse qualifies. It certainly isn\\'t a luxury car, and GM placed it as the replacement for the Regal. Cost-wise, it\\'s right where the Accord and others are as well.Small car? No. Large? Not really. Luxury? Nope. Sporty? Gotta be kidding. That basically leaves 20-30K family sedan, which is what this group seems to be about.  One thing that drops the Maxima off my shopping list (but won\\'t matter to 95% of buyers) is no manual tranny option. The Altima can be had with a manual.  Good point. Another way Nissan differentiates between the Altima and Maxima.  Elroy,Autocross is typically a \"course\" configured with a bunch of traffic cones in a parking lot. Emphasis is much more on driver skill and car control than overall top speed, as cars rarely get above 2nd gear.HPDE stands for high performance driving event, which used to be called \"hot lapping days\" at local road courses. In California, this means Willow Springs (and \\'Streets), Buttonwillow, Laguna Seca, Sears Point, etc. The Contour with slightly upgraded brakes and R-compound tires was amazingly competitive in its class. Incidentally, the early 90s Accords do well in autocross type events, especially with a warmed over suspension.Anything off road will have a very different suspension, there might be some confusion between rally-cross (auto-cross in the mud) or true rally stage races and the on-pavement events.That said, stock road going versions of the WRX/STI and EVO (the Subie and Mitsu) are very popular at these events beginning in the late 90s when the Civic and Sentra started to lose their sport compact following. Like I said earlier, if BMW can have the ride/handling balance they had in 1992/3, why can\\'t other automakers figure out how to do that now?  Like I said earlier, if BMW can have the ride/handling balance they had in 1992/3, why can\\'t other automakers figure out how to do that now? Their job is not to figure that out. Their job is to build cars that consumers want to buy. When the top 3 selling vehicles (in 2006) are F-150, Siverado, and Camry and the top 8 include another truck, Corolla, and Impala...this does not lead one to believe that consumers are looking for BMW-like vehicles, does it?  Their job is to build cars that consumers want to buy.This is an interesting use of the word \"want.\" I think their task is to make vehicles people feel they \"need.\" I don\\'t want a new CamCord particularly, I want something fun to drive that can go around corners well and doesn\\'t physically beat me up on the freeway. I need a car with 4 doors, 5 seatbelts, and 3 pedals (well, okay the 3 pedals is a want, but I won\\'t buy an auto).Also, I would argue that their job isn\\'t to make cars people want, rather their job, especially to their shareholders, is to be profitable. BMW seems to be able to do that with a very low volume.   I guess I have to be more careful about closing those loopholes  . Let me put it this way...their job is to build cars that people will buy at a price that generates a profit.Is BMW low volume in Europe?Toyota seems to be very profitable at high volume and has the biggest selling mid-size car, despite the fact that you (or I) will not buy one.  Toyota seems to be very profitable at high volume and has the biggest selling mid-size car, despite the fact that you (or I) will not buy one. This is likely due to the fact that Toyota doesn\\'t try to sell \"clearance rack\" vehicles, which many automakers have been guilty of, less so recently. They build (arguably maybe, lately) high-quality cars for the most part, and don\\'t have to sell them at major discounts. People like high-quality, and apparently are willing to pay a little more for it. I imagine when Honda comes out with is new Accord, prices will be right back at sticker (as opposed to right now where people are getting real steals of $1,000-$1,500 below invoice since the current Accord is in its last few months of life). Honda also builds high(er) quality vehicles than much of its competition, and people are willing to pay more for it (and when the higher sale price outweighs the higher build price due to better quality, more profit is had).  Toyota seems to be very profitable at high volume and has the biggest selling mid-size car, despite the fact that you (or I) will not buy one.As Toyota exec said at NAIAS 2 years ago: the number one selling ice cream flavor in the US is vanilla. Big companies like Toyota design their vehicles to appeal to the broadest group. They are designed to not offend anyone and have a high feature content. They make relatively few models (the Honda 2 model 3 trim line is the master of this) and they will work for most of the people. Its the people that want something more interesting or exciting that don\\'t meet the criteria.Smaller companies like BMW design vehicles to appeal to those who do want something with a little more soul. An example is very few Toyotas are available with a manual transmission (and since its only ~8% of the market, Toyota doesn\\'t care), while almost every BMW is available with a manual transmission.BMW is low volume relative to other manufacturers (VW, Peugeot, Renault) even in Europe. They are also very profitable.  Honda also builds high(er) quality vehicles than much of its competition, and people are willing to pay more for it (and when the higher sale price outweighs the higher build price due to better quality, more profit is had).This is the perception at this point, anyway.  I think it\\'s not really quality that sells the Camry (remember, we are only discussing mid-size cars here  ), instead I beleive it is more about \"reliability\". The perception of many is that if you buy a Camry, it will require very few or no repairs.  Take a look at the Car and Driver comparison. 2x not just once the Fusion beat out the Camry and Accord. Once on the East Coast and once on the West Coast. READ the comparison. These are everyday people NOT Ford employees like some like to spread misinformation. Also, some say, the Fusion has AWD, not fair.. So is the Camry/Accord having stability control fair? Read the article these are Like Vehicles, and are all V6\\'s too before that excuses pops up.. Word is spreading folks, consumers are taking notice of other brands of vehicles. Frankly, I won\\'t spend the extra $$ for a perceived reliability/quality advantage.  It\\'s not just perception. Fords (and GM for that matter) ALWAYS finish at or near last in reliability surveys. US automakers nearly abandoned their passenger cars back in the 90\\'s and focused all their money, research, and time on SUV\\'s. They let top selling cars like the taurus rot on the vine never thinking or caring that the SUV craze would someday come to an end. And now, they find themselves 10yrs behind japan in automotive technology and design.  I\\'m going to tackle several replies in one post, so bear with me...In automotive technology they are somewhat behind the curve (less efficency and less power from the engine in the Fusion vs. that in the Accord). They are not so behind as to be ridiculed too harshly, however (Ok, the 4.0L in the Explorer and Mustang is a rough old dog compared with the sixes of THIS century) but the Fusion is perfectly adequate and is competitive.In reliability, Ford\\'s Fusion is doing quite well. Unfortunately that doesn\\'t translate across the line, however (my parents are shopping for a second car, possibly a convertible, or maybe an SUV - the Explorer and the Mustang were both unable to be recommended by CR because of poor relibaility). The Fusion however, is well above average according to CR.For some in this forum, it seems that you are more defensive of your choice than you have to be. Nothing in here has to get personal, and because one person drives a Nissan and another drives a Toyota, it doesn\\'t mean that the driver of one thinks the buyer of the other is stupid, so quit implying that. Quality IS perception, scape. I \"perceive\" the knobs, buttons, materials, and design to all be of higher quality, with better motion to things like blinker stalks, HVAC, and stereo, in my Accord than in the Fusion. You perceive it differently. If it\\'s not perception, I\\'d love to see the quantitative facts proving different. Otherwise, it is subjective perception.  Fords (and GM for that matter) ALWAYS finish at or near last in reliability surveys. Actually, the Euro brands are typically in that spot, but thanks for proving the case.   Fusion is a good car, however in my opinion the Accord is still better, for the following reasons:Reliability: not a landslide, Fusion appears to be \"above average\" according to most sources so far, however Accord is tops. This isn\\'t perception, Accord reliability and longevity is well documented, and although Fusion is being received well, it is an unknown, and Fords of the past have been so-so (I won\\'t buy another one after my 2004).Resale value: I know many people intend to keep their cars longer than the early (1-5) years where depreciation matters most, but cars can be stolen or totaled, and value counts. I suspect the difference between values of used Accords and used Fusions will typically be more than the difference in purchase prices when new. Even really old Accords command serious money; I sold a 10-year old Accord with 140,000 miles for $4,000. Try that with a Ford.Interior: Accord interior is more attractive and comfortable (to me). All of the controls feel much more sophisticated and pleasing to operate.Refinement (especially engine and trasmission): big advantage for the Accord.I drive a 2007 Accord 4-cylinder with a manual, and have been very impressed so far at 3,000 miles total. I don\\'t miss having a V6 at all, it is a quick car at about 7.5 seconds to 60. That\\'s not far off from a Fusion V6 (and I have tested this myself by driving both cars, plus last weekend when a Mazda6 V6 Auto tried to beat me from a red light to get into my lane). Great mileage too, just got back from a business trip and pulled 34mpg at 80mph with the AC on.  Yeah leave it to me, I got a sub-par Accord :lemon: and the greatest Ford Contour ever made lol   LOLIt happens! Not every car will hold up to its reputation, and you proved it!Actually, I never heard of the Contour being particularly good OR bad, to be honest.  there is an interesting graphic in this year\\'s CR 07 automotive issue, a line chart comparing the reliability (problems per 100 vehicles) of all brands over longer periods of time - out to 10 years. Ford, while middle of the pack, does do better than GM/Chrysler. The top 3? Toyota/Honda/Nissan in that order - by substantial margins. While it does appear that Ford can build better cars in Mexico than they can in this country, the jury is still out on things like the Fusion, it just hasn\\'t been around long enough yet and unlike those \\'Japanese 3\\' Ford doesn\\'t have the same sort of history producing quality vehicles that those mfgrs. do. Agree with you on the technology \\'lag\\', slow sales and lack of sophistication perhaps 2 reasons why some of these American branded cars are doing better.  Now I can\\'t speak for a Contour, but I did have a 1998 Mazda 626 ES-V6 for a number of years. I don\\'t think the Contour and the 626 were as similiar as the Fusion and Mazda6 are, but they had a lot in common. The 626 was an great car, in performance (V6/manual), comfort (leather, moonroof) and long-term reliability (over 100k miles no problems).I\\'d have bought a stick-shift V6 Mazda6, if only I wasn\\'t so scared of reliability and resale.Question for discussion: Why is the Fusion consistently ranked as substantially more reliable than its Mazda6 counterpart?  I\\'ve come to the conclusion (after reading this forum for a while) that each person\\'s idea of a \"Great Car\" can be as different as his/her favorite food. For some, an automatic transmission car, can have no \"Soul\". Others believe that if a car does not handle like a sports car, it\\'s boring. I would submit to you that even Buick owners can feel as passionate about their car, as you do. I enjoy driving as much (or more than) the next guy, and I don\\'t have to be shifting it manually, or going around corners with my hair (what little there is) on fire. Constantly shifting in heavy traffic, and being pounded by a stiff suspension, is not my idea of enjoying the ride. BMW did not corner the market on \"Soul\". Many Accord owners feel as (or more) passionate about their cars, as BMW owners do, believe it or not. Luckily different car makers make different cars, so we can all find the one we like best.   I don\\'t think the Contour and the 626 were as similiar as the Fusion and Mazda6 are, but they had a lot in common. Mechanically you are totally correct, the Contour and the current get Fusion/Mazda6 have very few if any shared parts. I just meant the Mazda6 is Ford\\'s \"sporty\" midsized sedan.I\\'d have bought a stick-shift V6 Mazda6, if only I wasn\\'t so scared of reliability and resale.Everyone has concerns that are very real to them that affect buying decisions. It sounds like you are very happy with your current ride, so who cares, right? I have yet to have a horrible experience with any vehicle, but I maintain them to a very high level of service. I typically own a car from about its 2nd or 3rd to 10th bday, so I actually like cars with poor resale value :P  I didn\\'t mean to make it sound like I was attacking other decisions on what makes something great for them. My buddy has a Geo Prism that he thinks is the greatest car ever because it was such a good deal. That makes the car great to him. Also, I definitely realize, like I\\'ve said, I\\'m not a typical consumer. Its all about what meets the wants and needs of the buyer.People feeling pasionate about cars, any car, is why we are here. That doesn\\'t necessarly imply or mandate that the car has a soul of its own, it is, as you say, about enjoying the ride.   The fusion is deffinitly a step forward for ford, and was designed to try and recapture some of the lost market share. We\\'ll have to wait a couple years to see if it pans out. But the reason, as I said before, is simple. Ford simply neglected the passenger car market in favor of trucks and SUV\\'s And it worked great. Back when SUV/truck sales exceeded car sales, Ford made a killing. And, they still dominate in those categories. The problem for them the last couple years is gas. with the price staying consistently above $2.00, people are returning to cars. And Ford has some catching up to do. And while ford was letting their best selling cars like the taurus and escort die a slow painful death, the big three asian manufactures were making their cars better and better. Ford was content to let them have that and focus on the much more profitable SUV/truck market. Ditto for GM.and another part of the problem is Hundai and Kia. Even when toyota/honda/nissan began to pass ford/gm in quality and reliability, the US automakers always had them in price. You could always save several thousand buying domestic. But with hundai/kia, the pricing advantage dissapeared. I doubt hundai/kia sales cut into toyota/honda/nissan much. Most of their sales probably came from the domestic three.

To each his or her own!Loren  The Ford Fusion was rated the most reliable mid-size for 2006.  By who? prosource1Reliability is important, but there are other qualities to consider (ride, quality, ergonomics, and power, just to name a few). My truck is reliable (for the most part), but I still don\\'t like driving it that much.  By...?  What the best car choice is for any individual varies depending upon what that person finds important.For instance, I\\'ve always liked how a Honda Accord drives but have never included an Accord in my final list when sedan shopping? Why? The back seat room just doesn\\'t compare well against competitors. This back seat deficit spans several generations of Accords. The Accord is the perfect car for lots of people. It\\'s just not the right choice for me.I think the lack of back seat room was also the biggest problem for Ford\\'s Contour. It didn\\'t have Honda\\'s reputation for reliability or quality to make-up for the lack of rear seat legroom.There are a lot of other preferences or priorities that can influence an individual\\'s choice. The local dealer matters. Toyota manufacturing may be great, but if the local Toyota dealer is terrible (like mine), a great Toyota is a bad choice. No car is good enough to make up for a bad dealer experience.I wish people would be more nuanced in their critiques. Resale value and reliability are not the only priorities that people balance when spending money. Repeating ad nauseum well-known strengths and never exploring other vices or virtues is a disservice to people looking for reasons to differentiate between the spectrum of choices available in the marketplace. Further, the statistical variations in \"quality\" or \"reliability\" are often far smaller than the perceptions. A market that failures to acknowledge real improvements sends very inconsistent messages to manufacturers.  I\\'ll agree, the \"compact\" Accords of 1997 and previous (I have a 1996, and the back seat is about like today\\'s Civic) had a small back seat. Have you tried a recent Accord? I think you\\'ll find it very competitive to other cars in its class (Altima, Camry, 6).I have a 2006 as well as a 1996 Accord, so I can compare both. I\\'ll agree that back seat room isn\\'t plentiful in the older models, but in 1998 it gained 3 inches of rear legroom, and more with the 2003 redesign. In 1997 and before, it was a \"compact\" car, but it moved up into \"midsize\" in 1998.Just something you may consider if you haven\\'t looked at Accord lately, look again.  Me too, my 2000 Accord wasn\\'t that great, it had it issues...   Visit this site. Camry owners around the net are starting to question the V6 auto MPG posted by Toyota.. And here is a site that did some research..http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/calculatorSelectEngine.jsp?year=2007&make=Toyota&- model=Camry  Some of you that have been around have seen reliability data posted in the last sedan comparison room. Shall we go back and start posting it again?  The back seat room just doesn\\'t compare well against competitors. What competitors? Please explain.No car is good enough to make up for a bad dealer experience.Dealer experience means little to me, because I don\\'t go there (only to buy maintenance parts). I wish people would be more nuanced in their critiques.So what nuances would you like to comment on? Maybe you should take your own advise here.Further, the statistical variations in \"quality\" or \"reliability\" are often far smaller than the perceptions.Read what you wrote here. I don\\'t think you meant what you said. :confuse:   Almost every other vehicle I\\'ve had has been able to get me to school or work or both and back, and been an entertaining autocross or HPDE companion.No midsize car is designed for that. Not even a 6. actually the 6 has done quite well in the World Challenge Touring Car Championship over the last few years. granted it\\'s a souped up version with many aftermarket parts, but it does show how good of chassis the 6 has. And keep in mind, the 6 is the only midsize sedan in this group that has been chosen as Consumer\\'s Digest Most Sporty Cars of 2007. I know several people who autocross their 6 who do quite well in their class. But even if they rank poorly, the 6 is fun to drive, and on top of that an autocross course will always make you a better driver since you will better understand the limits of your car. Perhaps this why the 6, despite it\\'s being one of the oldest designs in this segment, continues to be rated highly by writers who find driving enjoyable/ fun and more than just a way to get from A to B. As Edmunds wrote in their summary of why they chose the Mazda 6 as the Editor\\'s most desired sedan under $25k for 2007, \"...the 6 offers comfort, capability and class for a surprisingly affordable price. Fun to drive, with smooth power delivery from the automatic, the 6 features a slick-shifting manual transmission if you so choose. Design is simple and tasteful inside and out.\" If you are a person who likes to occasionally take turns faster than most others or like to find gaps in traffic to get ahead of it, you will enjoy the Mazda 6\\'s great handling characteristics.  Scape2, I know you like your Fusion, and I am happy for you. Give the Camry a rest, please. You don\\'t have to buy one, if you don\\'t want to. zzzzoom6, the Mazda 6 sounds like your kind of car. I am 44 years old, and don\\'t drive my car like it\\'s a toy. \"Fun\" is not what I\\'m looking for. Just an enjoyable drive. I\\'m kind of the middle ground here (too old for the 6, and too young for a Buick). The Accord is perfectly in the middle, just how I like it.  No, I posted some earlier, thanks.  Wait a minute. This is supposed to be a comparison room right? Someone posted MPG figures for the V6 Camry, touting that if the V6 offers great MPG than why not have all this HP right? I am questioning the MPG figures touted by Toyota, so are others around the net. This site just proves why people are questioning the High MPG numbers that the manufacturer says the car is supposed to get. Why give it a rest? It it because its a Camry it should not be questioned? :confuse:  Actually, I think I\\'d be quite happy with the Accord (much happier, I think, with the next gen accord). In fact it was second or third on my list of cars I would have bought. But it was the the flexibility of a hatchback the sealed the deal on the 6. I\\'ve had 2 Accords in the past and liked them a lot, especially the coupe where I learned how handy a hatchback can be while still looking good. I especially like Honda\\'s center console and manual tranny - my favorites in this class. Really, I could make a very strong case for the Accord. But when it came down to signing the dotted line, I had a stronger case for the Mazda based on my wants and needs. btw - from a suspension/ ride viewpoint, I don\\'t think the Accord is in the middle of this group. I\\'d rate it in the top 3 for firmest suspension in this group (granted none of these cars have a really \"firm\" suspension...they\\'re family cars after all; but some are firmer than others).  For fun, go to MSN reliability data and compare a 2003 Focus to a 2003 Civic. What a surprise! But if you asked anyone, they would say the Focus is unrelaible and the Civic is reliable.. Why? Check other makes/models as well, what a surprise.. :shades:  Why give it a rest? It it because its a Camry it should not be questioned?No, but it would be a bit different if we hadn\\'t all gone down this road before in the last room, that got shut down for its redundant arguing.Why do you constantly imply that the Camry and Accord are on some pillar of greatness, while you tout yourself as a martyr buying a \"lowly Ford Fusion?\"I\\'ve already said it once today, but I\\'ll say it again... All Honda and Toyota owners do not think that Ford owners bought a sub-par vehicle, just one that didn\\'t meet their needs as well, which, last I checked, is what you did. You wanted a fun car, with a V6, great styling, and a very reasonable price. The Fusion certainly delivers on that. I wanted a fun car, with great economy, and the best interior for my budget. For me, the Accord delivers.Do I cry \"look at me, i took a chance on poor old Honda\" though? Nah, I\\'m too busy driving! I also don\\'t sarcastically berate other car manufacturers, like you constantly do to Honda, and especially Toyota. Please give it a rest before this forum gets out of control AGAIN and gets shut down AGAIN.  Or go to Consumer Reports and compare a CURRENT Pilot to a CURRENT Explorer. You\\'ll find the Explorer couldn\\'t be recommended because of poor reliability, while the Pilot is recommended.This means nothing in this board however, just like you bringing up a 5 year old economy car that isn\\'t even made anymore. I ask, why?The Fusion and Accord are both highly rated, which are the only Fords and Hondas that should be in this discussion.  Doesn\\'t the EPA do the mileage estimates? Not Toyota. Frankly, I trust my own mileage, rather than EPA\\'s estimates (actual mileage may vary). I find EPA estimates on the Accord kind of low, on the V6 anyway.  I think in the 90s, Honda had the best FWD manual transmission in the business. I think the current Accord is highly competitive although perhaps not class-leading. A short throw shift kit like Subaru offers would help the feel a lot.Also in the olden days of yore (the mid 90s :P ) it was pretty easy to pick up aftermarket suspension components for Hondas that firmed them up quite a bit (shocks, sway bar links, and bushings) could button things down while not dramatically affecting ride quality, slaming the thing to the ground, or most importantly, knocking me out of stock classes.Toyota has TRD, Subaru has STI, even Chrysler has DirectConnection, but Honda lacks an in-house aftermarket performance supplier. These places allow one to add performance without affecting warranty, etc.  Honda lacks an in-house aftermarket performance supplier.While not being a full line, they do offer the \"A-Spec\" upgrades. Just thought I\\'d mention that. I think the current Accord is highly competitive although perhaps not class-leading.For the current Accord to be near the top of the pack five years after being introduced (and with all other cars except the Mazda 6 being redesigned since then) I\\'d say Honda has performed an amazing feat. I must say, some of use feel it is still at the top of the pack (those that bought one obviously  as well as the latest tests of the Accord, placing it ahead of the Optima, Camry, Altima, Sebring, and Aura.This is the most recent post in the Accord Prices paid forum:Earlier this month I purchased a 2007 Honda Accord SEDAN (not the coupe) EX-L V-6 Automatic Transmission with Navigation for $25,061.76 (NOT INCLUDING TAX AND TAGS). That is a $30,000 car for $25,000. If you like the Accord in its current iteration, now is the time to get a steal. This price is $5,000 below sticker, and fairly typical on the forum, opposed to some people who imply that \"Honda dealers don\\'t deal.\" It just isn\\'t true, they do!  I think the current Accord is highly competitive although perhaps not class-leading. Sorry, I should clarify. I meant with regard to its manual transmission.As far as A-spec, its a start, but TRD offers a supercharger for a Camry for crying out loud.  Ford simply neglected the passenger car market in favor of trucks and SUV\\'s... I think you have reversed cause and effect. The consumer did not want to buy cars, they wanted to buy SUVs and trucks. Ford produced vehicles to meet that demand. The F-150 is still the biggest selling vehicle in the US and the Siverado is second.What happened to new cars that Ford did come out with? In 1995 the Contour (a smallish midsize car, imo) was introduced and it never did sell well in the US, a new version of it is still going as the Mondeo elsewhere. Getting back to current mid-size cars, in the recnet past I\\'ve read some complaints here on edmunds and elsewhere along the lines of \"why doesn\\'t Ford bring the new Mondeo to the US?\" Well, my understanding is that car starts at about $27K in Europe, does anyone really think this would sell here at anything close to that price? I don\\'t...they could maybe try to sell it, in very limited numbers, as a Lincoln, replacing the Fusion sibling.  from a suspension/ ride viewpoint, I don\\'t think the Accord is in the middle of this group. I\\'d rate it in the top 3 for firmest suspension in this groupJust curious who you would put as the third one in that group? In addition to the 6, I liked the handling/ride of the Fusion, but did not drive Altima or Accord enough to really make a good comparison.I did not drive the Accord enough to really know if I would like it, I suspect I would. The only negative I noticed was the steering was too light. I did not give it serious consideration, because I really don\\'t like the appearance and then on top of that the price would have been much higher than my Mazda6. It\\'s a wonderful thing when the car you like the best also has one of the lowest selling prices in the group :-).  this would be from that Ford commissioned study of vehicle reliabilities?   jeffyscott- you have to admit, that in the SUV euphoria of the later 90s none of the \\'Detroit 3\\' did anything to develop anything in the car end of things. Even the Fusion/6 while they are decent designs are plagued by antiquated and non-competitive drivetrains. The GM entrants? - historically and still largely plagued by what version of a pushrod V6 you really don\\'t want. And the Sebring? - enough said.  Your efforts to encorage some civility in this forum and preclude another shutdown are laudable and it would be nice if they were taken to heart. I`m not optimistic however given the strongly held views and biases that are so prevalent and the emotions that seem to inevitably get out of conrol. It would be so nice to actually comment on and compare cars by some metric ( build quality; material quality;conveniece features;comfort features; ergonomics ; handling: drivability; acceleration; exterior style; or whatever!! But I fear this is a pipe dream- SIGH .  Micro, take heart, I think with the exception of a few, most of us are discussing metrics. I think we are struggling to define and quantify those metrics, with the majority of posters providing good insight on what benchmarks they use to define those metrics.With the exception of a few \"Toyota good/Toyota Bad/Ford Good/Ford Bad\" type posts, I think we are on a good path. I know have a lot of insight in to what drives Elroy\\'s, Graduates, and ZZZMazda6\\'s purchase decisions and how they evaluate their vehicles.I think its important to realize that different folks expect different things from vehicles, so what is good for one might not be good for another.  you have to admit, that in the SUV euphoria of the later 90s none of the \\'Detroit 3\\' did anything to develop anything in the car end of things.I think that is an exxageration, at least in terms of Ford (reference the Contour). And the point is this is a result of consumer preferences, Ford and GM are not the cause of the SUV craze...the american public (and CAFE) are.As to \"antiquated and non-competitive drivetrains\", I do not agree with that with regard to Fusion/Mazda6. I don\\'t see being behind in the excessive horsepower bragging rights contest as a real world performance issue...it\\'s a marketing issue. I think you have a valid point on the GM pushrod V6, but that should not be classified with the current Ford V6. The 2.3L 4 cyl first came out in 2000, that is not antiquated. I don\\'t know enough about whatever Sebring is using to comment. Anyway, I think Ford/Mazda has updated these engines over time and they do put 5 and 6 speed automatics in the Fusion/6. I don\\'t know about the V6 versions, but in the 4 cylinder midsizes Sonata, Sebring, the GM entrants, and Subaru Legacy all are still using a 4 speed auto, as was Altima prior to the CVT.  Micro, take heart, I think with the exception of a few, most of us are discussing metrics.Yes and now if we can also convince those who are discussing manufacturers and the history of SUVs/trucks, we\\'d be completely back on track.   I don\\'t know enough about whatever Sebring is using to comment. I think the Sebring uses the the 2.4 \"world engine\" that was made by DCX, Hyundai and Mitsubishi for Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance (GEMA). Its got VVT and all the buzzwords. It comes as a 1.8,2.0, and 2.4. Production began in 2005.Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance  I think its important to realize that different folks expect different things from vehicles, so what is good for one might not be good for anotherA very nicely put observation ! Its unfortunate that much of the discussion reverts to a sometimes irrational defense of a prior purchasing decision and escalates into a pissing contest !  and escalates into a pissing contest !I\\'m all for pissing. eh hmm I mean...eh...I\\'m gonna go for now   some of you are trying to be helpful, but the best way to help is to post in the ways you are wishing that others would post and just ignore those who are not. If someone is way out there, feel free to drop me an email to get me here sooner than I might be otherwise.Continuing the conversation about what others should be doing isn\\'t really moving us in the right direction.Thanks for your help with this.  The 6 cyl Sonata has had a 5 speed automatic (with \"shiftronic\") since the 2006 model year.I, too, don\\'t know about the other models you mentioned.  So for the Sonata at least the trans on the V6 is off the \"antiquated and non-competitive\" list, but the 4 speed trans on the 4 cylinder remains. And according to what was posted above the Sebring 4 cylinder engine is also off the list, but the associated 4 speed trans still remains.   I\\'d put the 6, accord, and altima as having the least amount of body roll when turning and having firmer suspensions than others. the sonata, legacy and fusion are pretty close in suspension firmness to those that I\\'ve mentioned, though body roll in the sonata seemed much higher than the others. strange since I thought the suspension was pretty firm but well dampened unless you hit something like a highway expansion joint.  And according to what was posted above the Sebring 4 cylinder engine is also off the list, but the associated 4 speed trans still remains.If I were a betting man, I would say the Sebring is likely to go CVT with the smaller motors and keep the 6 speed auto for the V6.  When looking for a new car, I did test drive the Fusion, and found it to be pretty good in handling. The Sonata seems to not have the same abilities in cornering, and the suspension from time to time thumps, like it has bottomed out. I ended up with the Accord SEV6, which has the 17\" wheels. Great handling, a little firm with those lower profile 17\" rims on the V6 model, but not too harsh. That said, my Dad prefers his 2000 Camry softer ride, so it ain\\'t for everyone. The i4 Accords, with 16\" wheels may have a tad bit more softness to the ride. The double wishbone suspension works like a champ for handling. And the SEV6 comes with the stability control standard.The Fusion, and Sonata are good cars, but with the Accord SE package, and current discounting going on for Hondas (check more than one dealership) it was just so much more of a deal overall than I could get on other cars tested. The Accord is now at a low price to buy, and has the resale value, and overall refinement. While the interior of the Fusion, Sonata and others like the Aura are OK, the Accord to me just seems one notch above. Same goes for the Honda engines. Smooooooth! When pushed, they make some sweet engine sounds, and do not sound at all like rattly old four bangers and V6 of days-gone-bye American engines. Attention to detail points go to Honda. Fusion is still using a rod to prop up the hood -- what\\'s up with that? The Fusion was fun enough to drive, and the Sonata has some good room inside, but seemed less interesting - more like an Impala. The Aura XR is one more exciting car to drive. I would say it comes closer to Honda / Camry for total points. It is sporty, a little more narrow, but overall pretty comfy. Aura XR and Accord were the too best overall rides I found. The Altima was another one I test drove, but it seemed not as quiet, had that different feel of the CVT transmission, I do not care for, and a strangely place emergency foot brake. Altima does have a nice look and some interesting gadgetry, like the push button start / stop button. I guess that is a good thing??If I lived in snow country, I would at least test drive a Legacy. I would have done a quick test run in a Legacy sedan, but none were on the local dealerships lot. Seems they sell more other types of Subarus.Did not test drive the new Camry. Too worried about the first year run cars possible defects. And the interior looked a bit misaligned, and/or something just not right about the overall appearance of several areas on the interior. The exterior is OK, with the funny nose up front as one sore spot. Camry typically doesn\\'t excite one for handling, though my Dad\\'s car, the 2000 Camry, is not bad. I was looking for a bit more snappy handling. :shades: Loren  \"Even the Fusion/6 while they are decent designs are plagued by antiquated and non-competitive drivetrains. \"I thought we were not supposed to bash in here? The drivetrains of the Fusion are anything but antiquated. It has a 6spd transmission. Double wishbone suspension, A 24v v6 Dual overheadcam engine that does have VVT. The Duratec is not \"outdated\" Granted it doesn\\'t offer an \"autoshift\" function. But if you would read other chats. 90 percent of people use \"D\" \"R\" and \"P\" 99% of the time. Now offers AWD also! I\\'ll give you the HP advantage when comparing the Accord/Camry/Altima V6\\'s. I know a Fusion will out handle a Camry hands down. And is even with the Accord. I have not driven a new Altima yet.  The Sebring, IMHO, is just too awkward looking to sell well. The Dodge Avenger looks a bit better. Overall, I doubt that there is enough to love about these two cars for there to be any larger number of sales for those two combined. The Avenger does have that \"cute factor\" of being a miniature Charger.Loren  Isn\\'t that 6 sp. the transmission developed between Ford and GM for all the new cars? And if so, why did Ford not go with the paddle shifter like on the Aura XR? Guess it is the cost. You are right, the Fusion is not antiquated, though the V6 is to replaced with the 3.5 some day.I have the Accord, which is a 5 sp, and has a D3 which holds the three lower gear. I like that, though the paddle shift on the XR is not a bad idea. Doesn\\'t the Ford, like the Honda have some sort of shift logic with the automatic? I think the Fusion 6 sp. should work just fine.Loren  Am I to respond to someone in this Forum? I simply posted a site showing differnet MPG for the Toyota Camry. This is called bashing. Some says the Fusion/Milan drivetrains are \"antiquated\". I respond showing otherwise. How then do we discuss?? or confront?? or respond in this forum?? :confuse:  Why do you feel the need to respond, contradict, or confront? I think its silly to assert that a Fusion is as good as an Accord. That\\'s my opinion. I test drove a V6 Fusion twice and tried to like it. But having owned both the Accord and a Camry its a stretch to call the Fusion in the same game.It ain\\'t. Go ahead and confront.  You wrote: If I lived in snow country, I would at least test drive a Legacy. I would have done a quick test run in a Legacy sedan, but none were on the local dealerships lot. Seems they sell more other types of Subarus.  - I\\'ve kept an eye on the Legacys because I like the car. I live in New England so the base car is the Special Edition. Good thing too, I need to have the power seat and the power moonroof. They\\'re already talking about the 2008\\'s coming in, which is probably why there are so few out there. The dealerships that thought to stock up will probably be able to sell them for more because the supply is so low on 2007\\'s.  Ford and GM are not the cause of the SUV crazeI never meant to imply they were. but when it hit, they focused entirely on it, to the detriment of their passenger car line. And, I\\'m not saying it was a bad business move either. Heck, Ford and GM made a killing durring that time. What I am saying is, it a lot of the reason ford and GM have the problems now that they do. It\\'s not to say they won\\'t be alright in the end, just that their years of neglect in the passenger car market has left them with some catching up to do. It\\'s made big news lately that toyota passed ford in sales, and will soon pass GM. Well, they did that in the passenger car market years, and years, and years ago. And Ford/GM allowed it to happen.But anyway, I do know a lot of mechanics who think the fusion might be the turn arround car for ford. So long as they keep improving on it, and don\\'t give up on it.  Why don\\'t we ALL drop the \"go ahead and confront\" attitude, okay?We\\'re here to discuss the positive and negative attributes of the cars in this class. We have GOT to keep in mind that the purpose of these discussions is to help people make buying decisions, not to somehow \"prove\" our own personal choice was the only one worth making.I think that there are many here who understand that and some who don\\'t. Let\\'s be crystal clear - those who can\\'t get a grip on that approach are very soon going to be watching from the sidelines.The confrontational attitudes must go.Thanks for your cooperation.  A 24v v6 Dual overheadcam engine that does have VVT.big deal, it is still a 15 year old design that is rough as a cob, and further sounds like something\\'s going to blow when and if you ask anything from it. A good illustration of why there is more to an engine that what we can read on a spec sheet and a genuine problem with this particular engine specifically noted in about every road test or consumer magazine that has looked at the thing over the last 10 years or so. I don\\'t consider this \\'bashing\\' at all, more an opinion (shared by others that know a lot more about this than I do) that I have that the Fusion/6, in this case, need better engines if they truly are to be regarded as comparable to the Camcordimas or even the Sonatas currently available - gimmicks like AWD and sponsored comparos notwithstanding. GM is finally starting to weed out all their multiple pushrod V6s, the new 3.6 a reasonable engine in the Aura (and the next Malibu), why not Ford? Take this all personally if you must, but that is not the intention here.  \"A 24v v6 Dual overheadcam engine that does have VVT.-- big deal, it is still a 15 year old design that is rough as a cob, and further sounds like something\\'s going to blow when and if you ask anything from it.\"I agree about the Fusion/Mazda6 engine, that Duratec 30 has been around forever and although it has been updated, basically it has stayed the same when it comes to NVH and general feel/refinement.I had a 2.5L V6 in the old 626 which was sort of related to the Duratec 25 from the Contour, just worked over by Mazda. This was 1998, and this V6 had 24 valves with DOHC, and although it didn\\'t have VVT it did have a dual stage intake manifold (cool stuff). Redline wasn\\'t until 7,000 RPMs and it was smooth and quiet all the way there, even after it had 100,000 miles. I wanted a replacement for that 626. When I drove the Fusion and Mazda6, and floored that 3.0, I felt like I was dogging it. The \"high RPM experience\" was nothing like in my old Mazda.Why can\\'t Ford make an engine that willingly revs up that high, and does so in a manner that makes you want to do it again? (Besides the Mustang GT, which we aren\\'t talking about...)  too many people form their opinions based on magazine comparisons. they do provide a yardstick, but they don\\'t always result in the same conclusion.i don\\'t mind some engine noise. wind noise bothers me more.if driven smoothly, those \\'rough\\' and \\'old tech\\' engines can deliver some very good gas mileage.don\\'t drive a 911, it may be a little rough. :P  Most journalists state that the Accord 4-cylinder is among the best in the world, it is like a BMW inline 6 in that it feels stronger than it\\'s specs suggest, makes them rethink the need for a V6, etc, etc...The Toyota 2.4L 4-cylinder, although just as powerful on paper, feels significantly slower, to me.The Fusion/Mazda6 2.3L is another step down. I noticed a big difference when driving a manual Fusion SE. Slow to rev, and not very powerful at high revs.Haven\\'t driven the Sonata 4 or the Nissan 2.5- I\\'d especially like to drive the Altima 4-cylinder now that it has a 6-speed manual!  RE: Accord discounts. I don\\'t know what they are presently. We bought an \\'07 Sonata SE w/XM in the end of February for $16,651 + doc fe and TTL for $4300 under invoice, or $6089 under MSRP. (Price included $2500 rebate) How much are the Accords being discounted from invoice or MSRP?  Isn\\'t that 6 sp. the transmission developed between Ford and GM for all the new cars? And if so, why did Ford not go with the paddle shifter like on the Aura XR? Guess it is the cost.To be brief, no. The 6-speed tranny in the Fusion is sourced from Aisin or Jatco, I can\\'t remember which one it is. From what I\\'ve read it would only take a software tweak to allow for the manumatic functionality in that tranny but Ford left it out for their own reasons. I personally don\\'t care for the manumatics myself as I\\'d rather have a stick. The lack of a stick with the V6 in the Fusion alone will keep me from ever buying one. IMO the lack of manumatic in the Fusion probably displeases the same amount of people as the lack of a stick does. My dad has an \\'06 Zephyr and didn\\'t even notice that there were no lower gears, aside from the \"L\", until I pointed it out. He doesn\\'t care. He just loves the car extra gears or not.  i have a focus with a 2.3 and 5 speed. i bought it because i read it was more powerful than the 2.0. i had no idea how much more that is. maybe in a fusion, it is muted somewhat.  agree about the Fusion/Mazda6 engine, that Duratec 30 has been around forever and although it has been updated, basically it has stayed the same when it comes to NVH and general feel/refinement. Its funny that 10 years constitutes forever nowadays. It was introduced in \\'96. The Vulcan 3L has been around forever (well at least since the Taurus of \\'86). By comparison, the K-family of engines (K24 is in the Accord) has been around since about 2000 or so, and the B-series it replaced had been around since about 1990 or so.I had a 2.5L V6 in the old 626 which was sort of related to the Duratec 25 from the Contour, just worked over by Mazda. Actually, the Duratec 2.5l in the Contour (introduced in \\'94) was totally unrelated to the Mazda 626/MX6/Ford Probe engine. The MPV shared the same block as the Contour but used different intervals.In the mid/late 90s, Mazda got the AJ with VVT, but I think that was only in the minivan until they 3.0 duratec went in the Mazda6.  Which one is it? Is the Accord less or more Expensive than a Fusion/Sonata? Every article/review/price comparison I have ever read or seen, or even car ads on Saturday/Sunday show Honda Accords to be prices at lease $2 - 3,000 more than a comparable Fusion/Sonata? :confuse:  I made what I thought was an innocent comment otherwise praising the Honda Accord but ruling it out for a relatively small backseat. I apparently offended at least one Honda fan and was challenged to prove it.I could answer that perceived size is enough to settle it for any consumer that values rear seat leg room in a midsize sedan. Most consumers don\\'t get out the tape measure. But to be fair and contribute to the discussion I went back and looked up the data with the midsize sedans I am actually considering (with one five door included because it was on my list). The cars are a pretty good cross section of mainline 2007 midsize sedans: Impala, Malibu MAXX (the five-door), Camry, Sedona, Fusion and Accord.I looked at reported rear leg room, rear hip room, rear shoulder room, and rear head room. In every circumstance but one (the Malibu\\'s rear hip room), the Accord was the smallest dimension or tied for the smallest dimension. I totaled the four measures for some rough measure of total differences. The Accord was smallest with the Fusion slightly larger. The Sedona and Impala were significantly larger. The Camry was in the middle. The MAXX does well for four passengers because it has great legroom and headroom on a narrower chassis. This pretty much parallels my perceptions. The Sedona and Impala were in fact my finalists partly because of interior space.Again, I love how Accords drive. The current Accord has a marvelously designed dash, both in function and aesthetics. It just doesn\\'t have a large back seat. It is driver focused (not necessarily bad, if that\\'s your priority). It is not as well disposed to transport three or four adults of 5\\' 10\" or taller in long distance comfort. To my senses the Accord may even feel smaller due to the shape of the roof and C pillar. The Fusion feels bigger to me than its actual dimensions revealed.I\\'ll restate my point. The best car varies based upon your priorities. As good as an Accord is (and I acknowledge it has many virtues), this one weakness is fatal given my priorities in buying a midsize sedan. I\\'m not saying anyone has to have the same priorities, but given the number of Sedonas and Impalas I see, I suspect I have company.I\\'d guess there are also other, similar, differentiating criteria beyond just resale value and reliability or perceived quality. I\\'d like to hear about other points of differentiation off the well beaten path of these three.Thanks. This is the heart of the automobile market. These cars serve a wide audience with vastly different mixes of priorities. So what tips the balance for you in the details of design?  The Accord and Fusion have the same size engine (3.0 liter V6). The Fusion engine is \"dual\" overhead cam with VVT. The Accord engine is \"single\" overhead cam with Vtec. The Accord V6 engine amazingly has 20 more hp, and runs smoother and quieter. So the Fusion engine should at least have better fuel economy, but sadly it doesn\\'t. Engine design, therefore, must be more important than the number of camshafts. The Duratec 30 is not outdated, or antiquated, so what\\'s the problem?  $25k for Accord EX-V6s with Navigation, overpriced?I guess we\\'re all allowed an opinion!  The Duratec\\'s actual design, and preproduction versions, were done by Porsche. Porsche sold the design to Ford. I would like to know the background of \"why\" Porsche sold the design. My daughter has a 2000 Mercury Sable LS Premium with the 3.0L Duratec, and it\\'s not as smooth as one would expect, and much noisier than any Japanese or Korean OHC V6.  I\\'ll start by stating for the record: I like this discussion, respect all posters, and love all cars. Well, at least 1/3 is true. I like this discussion.My dollar vote, all things considered, is for the midsize from Marysville Ohio. The design has been around since 03 which may be outdated to some, but certainly is still competitive in 07. I can\\'t wait to see what the 08 will add to this competitive market. Bottom line: many good choices, but for my buck, Marysville won.I apologize in advance for having offended or challenged anybody with this post. (NO SOUP FOR YOU!!)  Scape, you can\\'t even go by the newspaper ads, most of them have enough small print to fill a phone book. They\\'re designed to attract attention and maybe catch unsavy buyers. You have to check an internet price or do a personal quote to find out the real street price. My recent expeiences say that internet pricing is the way to go. Forget MSRP or dealership ads, find out what the car really costs.  Once again PERCEPTION. Someone in the last sedan room posted 0-60 numbers and 45 - 60 numbers for the 4cyl Fusion vs Camry vs Accord and the numbers showed different. The 4cyl Fusion if I remember was .1 second slower 0 - 60 .. Perception.Searching through the last sedan room, I didn\\'t find the post you mentioned, that had numbers showing a Fusion 4-cylinder was .1 second slower 0-60 than an Accord 4-cyl.I did find a post that referenced these numbers from Consumer Reports:Honda Accord sedan - I4 2.4L (166 hp) 5A + ABS 7.91 16.22 90.80Honda Accord sedan EX - V6 3.0L (244 hp) 5A + ABS 7.80 15.88 93.70 Ford Fusion SEL V6 - 3.0L DOHC (221 hp) 6A + ABS 7.47 15.78 92.30 Ford Fusion SEL - I4 2.3L (160 hp) 5A + ABS 9.36 17.27 82.50 Anyways, not that the actual numbers matter all that much, you keep keying in on PERCEPTION... Well, since I dove a couple of Fusions before I bought my Accord, and I perceived that A) they were much slower, and  flooring the cars was not fun, as the engines were rough and harsh... I felt that was significant.It\\'s not so much the age of the Duratec 30 that is an issue. It is that harshness at high RPMs has been a criticism for many years and Ford hasn\\'t found a way to fix that. Why can\\'t Ford make a V6 for a midsizer that has a high RPM and is smooth and refined such that it makes you want to open it up?  I got about $1,600 off sticker. I hear of much larger discounts. Could be why I got a pretty good trade-in for my PT Cruiser. I would expect somewhere around $1,600 to possibly as much as $2,000 or more off on the SEV6, which is a great pkg. There are claims of $4,000 or more off, but it is hard to believe. I was pleased to see over $1,000 off on a Honda, as discounts are tight compared to other cars. Resale on Honda Accords is outstanding. At least here in California, they are as good as gold. At around $22,000 say for discounted Accord SEV6, I think it is a very good deal. So you got a Sonata SE, I assume V6, for $16,651 ??? Sounds like those desperate days of deep discounting which GM did some time ago. Is Hyundai in trouble? I did see some $5K off on Mazda6, but the sticker price would only reduce to around $22k, as they all seemed loaded.Loren  I have a Ford Focus ST with the 2.3 5-speed. That extra power makes me grin every time I drive it. It is so much fun in a relatively inexpensive car. It is transformational power. The 2.0 liter Focus doesn\\'t feel like the same car. I love cars, but none of my bigger or more expensive cars have ever given me so much bang for the buck in driving enjoyment.  Accord V6, with automatic, 0-60 6.6 seconds, with sweet Honda engine singing all the way. The Aura XR 3.6 V6 DOHC is also a fine sounding and revving engine.  :shades: Loren  Wish the XR were available when I bought my 01 LW300 (which is long gone and I took a bath). What a difference!! Still happy with my midsize from Marysville.  Does the \" L \" chose from 2 or 3 lower gear selections? The Fusion automatic may work just fine for most all occasions.A stick can be fun, but not around town. I prefer a stick on a sports car, preferably RWD. For FWD, from now on, I will stick with automatics. My Accord has the D3 selection for gears, and that seems to work for those times in town you wish for only three gear shifts, or on the twisty roads when you do not want a taller gear, or changes going on as much during corners. It has some sort of grade logic to the automatic too, which helps. I will wait for a sports car, with RWD, to get back into clutching again. Never owned a car with Tiptronic, so I have no idea how good or bad it would be, other than to say, I would likely miss the clutch and stick fun. :shades: Loren  Are you talking net-net price, as in to buy and trade-in value? If so, they are likely to be about even, or more costly for the Fusion and Sonata. And are they the same car. Will they both look as good and drive as good five years down the road? Does the Fusion come with Stability Control? It is hard to put a finger on the actual price. You could use Intellichoice website, which I used for the price when I went to the Honda dealership. My guess is that Sonata may deep discount the most, though Ford has to be pretty desperate by now, and may match Hyundai. But then again, not all the same features.Loren  Ford has Duratec derivatives that do exactly that - wind to 6500 with gas turbine smoothness, have big fat torque curves, and make you want to do it again and again. They\\'re the 2.5/3.0 liter engines used by Jaguar. These are beefed internally, have VVT, solid lifters, triple stage mainfolding, and are high compression. They make enough suds to get a heavy AWD X Type automatic to 60 in 7.1 seconds and give it a top speed of 150 MPH (in Europe). US versions are electronically limited to 121 top end.Regards:OldCEM  Ford has Duratec derivatives that do exactly that - wind to 6500 with gas turbine smoothness, have big fat torque curves, and make you want to do it again and again. Do these engines (or derivatives) make the Fusion engine better? Not in the least. :confuse:  Accord V6, with automatic, 0-60 6.6 seconds, with sweet Honda engine singing all the way.Its tough to beat a Honda engine. Add in all the ergonomics and tactile Honda feel with a huge dose of reliability and its tough to beat even a 5-6 year old designed Accord.All the other cars in this class have redone their versions recently (maybe not the Mazda) and Honda can still outdo them. When the 08 Accord arrives Honda will, once again, set a new standard that all others will be compared to.  GM is finally starting to weed out all their multiple pushrod V6s, the new 3.6 a reasonable engine in the Aura (and the next Malibu), why not Ford?Mr. Captain2 - Is the 24v V6 DOHC w/VVT in the Fusion/Mazda6 a \"pushrod\" engine?  3.0L Duratec, and it\\'s not as smooth as one would expect, and much noisier than any Japanese or Korean OHC V6. My point exactly, and not a reason to \\'bash\\' Ford (or Mazda) products, more to point out that those particular cars could be improved so much with some heart transplants. Maybe the new DT 3.5 will help with the problem, but I\\'m not sure that it will acutally find its way under Fusion hoods. Putting the engine in a lower volume high priced Lincoln is one thing, getting it into the Fusion/Milan/6 may be more than Ford can handle from a production capacity standpoint.  I didn\\'t say it was, the GM comment meant to point out that they have started to get rid of many of those old 50s vintage pushrods in favor of that new 3.6 which is all those things you seem to value. Keep in mind that the Honda V6, is still SOHC, and is unarguably vastly superior (in terms of HP and refinement) than the DT3.0. IT IS NOT all about the number of valves or cams you have, VVT etc - there is more to it than that, it\\'s called refinement.  >refinement. Exactly what are the things that cause refinement? What parts in the motor have to be there?  Its a balanced, rotating assembly. They all make some noise. What is a big difference is the amount of research that goes into insulating the driver from these vibrations.Even the older Hondas have very advanced, active engine mounts designed to dampen the vibration of the engine and mute sounds from the engine compartment (of course these fail over time and are somewhat costly to replace). Additionally, the exhaust note can be engineered as well. Cars like the Miata had extensive research put into optimizing the exhaust note.I don\\'t understand why Ford doesn\\'t sweat the details a little more with respect to NVH and all of these complaints will go away. Improved motor mounts and some additional insulation should solve the problem.Its funny though, I don\\'t mind some mechanical noise. I think that is one of the reasons I like the Subaru so much. I feel part of the driving experience as opposed to isolated from it.  keeping this on topic, and comparing my wife\\'s Altima VQ 3.5 then to the DT in the Fusion or any other Ford so saddled and disregarding the HP/torque differences. The Altima will rev freely and quickly right up to redline so much so that you almost have to be careful not to bounce off the rev limiter - the Fusion/6, well, you end up just kinda gritting your teeth as the engine strains to meet your demands, the engine is much louder and feels strained. I\\'m relatively sure it is a function of engine design and balance and engineering expertise, is probably going to need overhead cams, and some sort of method to keep an engine operating at peak efficiences in the higher rev ranges - otherwise known as VVTi (Honda/Nissan/GM 3.6/Hyundai) different than just VVT or CVVTi (Toyota). In essence, the DT has the basic ingredients, but somehow the cake was burned coming out of the oven. I think it is a shame that when Ford, in this case, was making money hand over fist back in the late 90\\'s, that they didn\\'t spend any of it on developing a competitive V6.  I\\'m relatively sure it is a function of engine design and balance and engineering expertise, is probably going to need overhead cams,The DT 3.0 is an overhead cam motor. While I think you have the right idea of improving breathing at high RPM, I think your mental model of how variable valve timing technologies work is a little skewed.The i-VTEC in the Accord operates only on the intake. There is a low and high RPM mode, and some component in the rollers allows for additional variation (which is different then the double cam version which allows the cam to operate 25 degrees out of phase). This second system is similar to Toyota\\'s VVTL-I which controls both lift and duration. The Porsche system (vario-cam) I believe primarily affects cam timing with respect to when the valves open, but not the lift and duration. I am ohly familiar with the earlier versions of Vario-cam so its very possible and likely they have modified their system as well.  The Altima will rev freely and quickly right up to redline so much so that you almost have to be careful not to bounce off the rev limiter - the Fusion/6, well, you end up just kinda gritting your teeth as the engine strains to meet your demands, the engine is much louder and feels strained.I will not put down the VQ in any way, shape or form, since I agree it\\'s a great engine, but the V6 in my 6, IMO, may be louder (due to less sound-deadening), but it\\'s NEVER felt \"strained\" to me, whether it\\'s on the open highway, or passing on a two-lane. Drop it a gear, hit the gas, and it goes, just as well as the VQ.In terms of refinement, both the VQ and DT don\\'t come close to Honda though...  I didn\\'t say it was, the GM comment meant to point out that they have started to get rid of many of those old 50s vintage pushrods in favor of that new 3.6 which is all those things you seem to value. Keep in mind that the Honda V6, is still SOHC, and is unarguably vastly superior (in terms of HP and refinement) than the DT3.0. IT IS NOT all about the number of valves or cams you have, VVT etc - there is more to it than that, it\\'s called refinement. Okay, just checking as in the past some on that other discussion seemed to confuse the old Vulcan V6 with the Duratec. I guess I somewhat misunderstood your point as I got the impression you were saying the DT3.0 should be grouped with 1950s pushrods. And actually, I am not real concerned about the number of valves. etc., etc...Anyway, I\\'m driving the 4 cyl Ford/Mazda engine. It seems fine to me, sounds good to me at all times and I have not felt there is any problem with reving the engine to redline. The one minor thing I have noticed is I feel some vibration in the steering wheel when stopped in \"D\"...I\\'ll find out when I go for my first oil change if this is normal or not. I don\\'t remember feeling this on my test drives, but that does not necessarily mean it was not there.  Car mags frequently suggest that one vehicle is \"more or less refined\"than another ! Now posters easily suggest that one engine is \"more or less refined\" than another . What exactly are we trying to describe when using this phrase to compare engines ? is it willingness to rev; NVH ( noise, vibration, harshness ); something else ?? Who`s willing to take a stab at defining this a bit better ?  While I agree with the most of what you are saying, I can\\'t help but wonder if you aren\\'t using the name Sedona, when you possibly mean the Sonata. :confuse:  Refined = it has \"honda\" or \"toyota\" label on it.   Actually, it\\'s a question that deserves some serious debate. What are the qualities of a vehicle in this class that any of you would define as \"refined\"? Indeed that is a term that is freely bandied about - let\\'s quantify it in tangible terms. The badging itself has nothing to do with it. IOW, define the characteristic itself - not the badge.  Very interesting thread. Good question as to what Refined actually means, if anything. IMHO when a mag. road tester says refined he is saying there have been improvement made over the years it has been in production. These improvements make the car, engine, trans, A/C unit or whatever, more efficient, quieter, smoother, closer fit, etc. Whatever, it means it meets the consumers desires better than last year.So refined means better, more useful, cheaper...That\\'s my opinion (at this time and I reserve the right to change my opinion in the future :shades: )  Oh, I would agree that it needs to be defined by those who use it...it\\'s just that my impression has been that the bandying has mostly amounted to my tongue-in-cheek definition.  One of the things I really liked about the older Accord (don\\'t have enough experience with the newer ones to comment) was the tactile feel of the buttons and knobs. Every control had a positive engagement and damped feedback.I contrast this to the Contour, which had less satisfying controls which had hard clicks, although it too, had very positive engagement. The function was there, it just didn\\'t feel as good. I also liked how easy to use the audio systems were in both of those cars.The controls on the Legacy feel very Honda-like, with that damped engagement feeling. It doesn\\'t have the control layout of the older Honda though, and I have to look down activate some features in the Subie (this might be because I don\\'t drive it as much).I think I can summarize refinement for me as the perception of quality in the things I touch when I\\'m in the car, so that is why I tend to concentrate on switches and controls.I don\\'t mind a bit of drivetrain noise, I like knowing there is an engine up there, so that\\'s not a big issue with me, nor do I need the interior cabin to be a library or mortuary.  I\\'m happy to offer my take on the qualities that make an engine refined or not.Using my Honda 2.4L inline 4-cylinder as an example of what I consider to be refined... Its as smooth at redline as at 1,000 rpm. Hold the RPMs anywhere in between and it always sounds and feels like it is meant for just that purpose; no vibration, and the tone from the engine and exhaust is nothing but pleasing. It never even gives you the impression that you are working it harder than it wants to. Going to high RPMs is sort of like switching from \"Low\" to \"High\" on my favorite 240-mph electric leafblower, in that it feels like just another setting available for normal use; no drama involved, just a louder \"whoosh\" and more performance when needed. Throttle it up and it lightly growls, then just sings... and you want to do it again. It is a great motor especially considering its in an inexpensive, practical sedan.Now, a motor that is not refined has none of the above qualities. In fact, in many ways it will be opposite. It may be perfectly acceptable under normal conditions, but push it and the sounds are harsh and displeasing, and/or you can almost feel the motor is out of balance, thrashing or vibrating. It doesn\\'t feel like it was made to rev that high. These engines make you feel guilty when you take them to redline, like you are damaging the motor based on how it sounds or feels through the controls. Floor it once, and you\\'ll think \"I don\\'t need to do that again unless I have to.\" The impression is that the engine is tearing itself apart to get at those high revs.When driving that DT30 Fusion, I enjoyed the performance, and please don\\'t think I am \"bashing\" or \"hating,\" but I wanted to lift off the throttle well before redline. It did not feel nearly as \"refined.\" This, to me, takes away some of the enjoyment of putting an internal combustion engine through its paces.  To me refined refers not to previous iterations of that make. I use it in comparison to other vehicles. If I think car A is more refined than car B, the sum of its qualities is better than it\\'s competitor. A lot of it will be subjective (interior and exterior appearance, the feel of the controls, handling, etc). Some of it isn\\'t (acceleration, noise, etc). It\\'s really how good a end product it is as a whole from the smallest detail on up.Do the door handles flex when you pull on them? Does the cup holder block the shifter? Does the steering wheel block the instrument cluster? Does the steering communicate to the driver what the car is actually doing? Do potholes make you wonder if parts of your car are falling off?  I love this.You say \"that the Honda V6, is still SOHC, and is unarguably vastly superior (in terms of HP and refinement) than the DT3.0\"You say that with a tone, to me anyway, that the Honda V6 is a superior power plant than, everything? I know that is not what you say, just the way it sounded when I reread it. That is a fine opinion and I am not saying you said anything wrong or that can be argued. You believe strongly in the, quality?, refinement?, efficiency?, superiority?, of the Honda engine(s).I have owned I4\\'s Turbo I4\\'s, I6\\'s V6\\'s H6\\'s, V8\\'s V10\\'s OHV, SOHC, DOHC, 2v/c, 4v/c, 1.2L, 2.L, 2.6L, 3.0L, 3.6L, 5.0L 5.3L, 5.7, 6.2L, and 8L cars/trucks.They all had superior something to something else and performed their assigned tasks very well for a long time (except for the aluminum Vega engine).So what is your opinion comparing the Honda V6 toCadillac (GM) 3.6 DOHC VVT V6 (DI 300 H-P version)?Lexus IS 3.5 DOHC VVT V6 (306 H-P)?How about the Audi new Diesel engines?  don\\'t know if it \\'skewed\\' or not, but not too many years ago we would put grind cams in our engines that effectively would hold intake valves open longer and in a slightly earlier part of the piston stroke, this would allow the engine to suck some more gas (improving breathing), in the process producing more HP and obviously improving \\'efficiency. The downside, of course, that loping idle becuase the engine would be less efficient at low rpms. So now we have VVT which is effectively a cam shift that occurs at higher engine speeds that does effectively the same type of thing except that it can also be \\'programmed\\' to occur as deemed necessary by engine loads, fuel octanes etc. - (the Honda VTEC, I believe) The Toyota system takes it quite a bit further, allowing for continuous adjustment on both the intake and exhaust sides again in response to computer readings - allowing for not only some HP, but also effectively \\'flattening\\' out of the torque curve, as well as improved emissions. (CVVTi in their lingo). The DT 3.0 if I\\'m not mistaken, is mechanical shift only on the intake side and does nothing about lift duration. If this suppostion is correct, don\\'t know if this could conceivably be why the engine is so reticent to rev and/or is relatively HP challenged. You sound like a man that could answer that?  Does the \" L \" chose from 2 or 3 lower gear selections?I\\'m not entirely sure but I recall someone posting that the manual states just that. When in \"L\" the tranny decides which gear is best, between 2 or 3 gears, given gas pedal placement, speed, etc. Someone who has actually used it could maybe let us all know how that works? A stick can be fun, but not around town. I prefer a stick on a sports car, preferably RWD. For FWD, from now on, I will stick with automatics.I\\'m the opposite for the most part. Cars we\\'ve owned with sticks include a \\'96 Civic EX, \\'98 ZX2, \\'04 Mazda6 S, and currently an \\'06 Mustang GT. The only one I hated driving in city traffic, which I do on a daily basis, was the Civic because it had zero low end power. As long as the car has some power and I don\\'t have to rev it up to move a few feet I\\'m happy. The 6 was FWD and an absolute blast to drive. FWIW I did test drive the Mazda6 i with a stick and the V6 with the manumatic. The i was like the Civic to me and the manumatic was useless because it shifted too early IMO. Plus there was the whole bored left foot sydrome associtated with it.   Honda continues to build about the best smaller engines on the market but what I was doing was comparing one of the best to perhaps one of the worst. In response to an argument that seemed to imply that that DT in question must be a good or current engine simply because it has 24 valves or multiple OHCs, and/or a rudimentary valve timing system. Those specific engines you mention, the Toyota 3.5, the GM 3.6 are fine examples or the state of the art and in that respect are \\'better\\' (if better, is defined as more current technologically) than the design that Honda is currently using. You forgot BTW the VW 3.6, the MB 3.5 and about every BMW inline 6 ever produced. Point taken, you can point to a whole bunch of engines over the years (the GM 3.8 and more V8s than you can count?) that has served their purposes well, but there remains a vast difference in how a Honda/Nissan/Toyota/Hyundai engine feels and sounds relative to that DT we were talking about) that is not exactly related to how much power each happen to put out.PS I fully expect that it\\'ll be Honda that shortly comes out with some engine superior in almost all respects even to the Toyota 2GR-FSE you mentioned.  When driving that DT30 Fusion, I enjoyed the performance, and please don\\'t think I am \"bashing\" or \"hating,\" but I wanted to lift off the throttle well before redline.Did you drive the 2.3L I4? If so, did you have the same impression of that engine?  When driving that DT30 Fusion, I enjoyed the performance, and please don\\'t think I am \"bashing\" or \"hating,\" but I wanted to lift off the throttle well before redline. It did not feel nearly as \"refined.\" This, to me, takes away some of the enjoyment of putting an internal combustion engine through its paces.Thank you, exactly what I\\'m talking about, with many of the other cars in this group, you don\\'t have the time to \"want to lift off the throttle\"  Did you drive the 2.3L I4? If so, did you have the same impression of that engine?Yes I have driven the 2.3L I4: normally aspirated in a 2006 Fusion SE manual, and then turbocharged and direct-injected in a 2006 Mazdaspeed Mazda6. In normally aspirated form, I noticed a slight \"buzziness\" to the sound, not entirely displeasing because it reminded me of the 2.2L I4 I had in my first car, a 1991 Mazda 626. Also, when accelerating through the gears, I\\'d let off the gas completely and push in the clutch, and the RPMs would always jump up by 500. The manual shift knob was huge, and the lever action wasn\\'t very precise (not unlike my 1998 626 ES-V6). As I mentioned before, the Ford/Mazda 2.3L (at least in the midsizers) feels a notch slower than the Camry 2.4L, which is a notch (or two) below the Honda 2.4L. Performance/acceleration numbers seem to bear this out. I\\'m sure it\\'s more fun in a Mazda3 or Focus. Bottom line, I wouldn\\'t call this motor \"unrefined,\" it was quite happy to buzz along. I just wanted more grunt from my 4-banger.In turbo form, the motor was a real hoot. Tons of torque, but power started to drop off above about 4,800 RPM. I liked it very much, and would have purchased it, but even heavily discounted to around $24,000 it was a little more than I wanted to spend, even before I figured up the insurance!  Yes, the SE is a v-6. Our price was $16651 + $189 doc fee plus ttl (6% sales tax) OTD 18,189.This was from a high volume dealer about 100 miles away. The local dealer was only discounting the car $500 and had a $210 higher doc fee and throws in $500 advertising for good measure. The dealer we bought from had an internet price of $1800 below INVOICE. There was a general $1,000 rebate and another $1,000 rebate if financed through Hyundai Finance (5.9% for 60 months)We also qualified for the owner loyalty rebate of $500. Our price for the car, before doc + ttl, was $4300 under invoice or $5429 below MSRP. The resale value game is a shell game. Trade-in value or retail value of a used car? I just saw Enterprise rent-a-car offering a comparably equipped \\'06 Sonata with 14,692 miles for $17,999 and they say, \"blue book retail value\" of $20,690. Enterprise is a \"no haggle\" price.  Thank you, exactly what I\\'m talking about, with many of the other cars in this group, you don\\'t have the time to \"want to lift off the throttle\" Now, I certainly don\\'t think the Fusion is slow when you get the V6. The DT30 may not like to rev high, but that 6-speed automatic is pretty good for a slushbox, and it makes up for it (I\\'ve always like Aisin-built trannys, had one in a Cherokee that was bulletproof). Once out of first gear, the transmission kept the motor on the boil. As I mentioned, it just didn\\'t seem very \"refined\" (see previous definition) when doing so. I guess what I\\'m trying to say is, I\\'d prefer that it be smoother as opposed to more eager to rev, because overall not that slow of a car. 7.2 seconds? Most V6\\'s these days are quicker. The Mazda6 with the same motor and equipped with a manual isn\\'t quicker because it only has 5 speeds versus 6 in the Auto. Some of the faster four cylinders in this class (Accord, Altima) can keep up when equipped with manuals. Decent performance.Can\\'t really use much more than that around here. My wife wants a new Mustang GT. I drove one for a couple of days last year. This was the drill: gas it in first to get going good, short-shift, give it some gas in second. You\\'re now going 10-15 mph over the speed limit. Shift to 5th.  Otherwise, I\\'d get in a lot of trouble. Insurance was too high on it to begin with.  The parallel you draw to reground cams with lumpy idles is a pretty good analogy to the high end cam profiles. It basically improves high end breathing, but does so without affect the low end torque and drivablilty.The original VTEC of the early 90s was variable cam timing, while later versions also affected lift (there is a component on the roller). I believe they can now do duration as well (i-vtec). Toyota skipped the early versions and showed up late with timing, duration and lift.Remarkably, the next leap might be GM with getting rid of the cam altogether.Again, the parallel to the lumpy cams is also seen in the aftermarket as a number of companies make \"vtec controllers\" that vary the rpms where they activate, etc.  The Mazda6 with the same motor and equipped with a manual isn\\'t quicker because it only has 5 speeds versus 6 in the Auto. Have any 0-60 times to back that up?I\\'ve driven the manual (my personal ride) and auto-equipped (test drives) V6-model 6\\'s, and I can tell you firsthand, the manual will beat it out of the gate every time, as long as the person behind the wheel knows how to properly operate three-pedaled cars. The auto is a 6-speed simply for better fuel economy (actually better than the manual on the highway, IIRC, according to the EPA.)  Most V6\\'s these days are quicker. The Mazda6 with the same motor and equipped with a manual isn\\'t quicker because it only has 5 speeds versus 6 in the Auto.The number of gears isn\\'t the issue, its the final drive ratio and the individual gear ratios, as well as top speed in gears. Manual transmission cars that are geared super short are slower because they have to be in 3rd to hit 60, while some of the taller cars can do 60 in 2nd. The time to shift is a factor here (I know don\\'t get started on DSGs and what not, take it to the manual trans forum).  I didn\\'t say the Fusion or the 6 were slow, acceleration is a function of HP and at 200+ HP they both will be reasonably quick although slower than most of the other V6 cars in this group. If the Fusion, for example, is going to get to 60 in 7 seconds, it\\'s more about how it feels and sounds when you ask it to really do it. Manuals will almost always be quicker and more economical than autos simply because there are less mechanical losses. More speeds in the tranny is fashionable right now but is more likely to improve FE than improve acceleration, it kinda depends on how the gear ratios are matched to the operating characteristics of the engine and how wide the engine\\'s torque curve is. The bigger Avalon 5 speed is every bit as quick as the 6 speed Camry and the FE ratings are also the same, somewhat a testimony to the flexibility of the engine they now share.  how about -refined = a car that is a pleasure to push a little orunrefined = a car that \\'screams\\' in protest when you do.Yes, the better V6s are generally found with those labels on it you don\\'t like or maybe you would consider taking a new Aura XR out on a test drive.   how about -refined = a car that is a pleasure to push a littleorunrefined = a car that \\'screams\\' in protest when you do. By push do you mean push the gas? Or is there some element of how it corners in there too? Does interior accommodations play any role in that?  yes that\\'s exactly what I mean, and certainly \\'refinement\\' issues extend beyond the engine compartment and into places like vehicle balance, braking systems and suspension designs - that last one being a place where the Fusion and the 6 both do very well.  Refined = Improvement of form or function, through redesigning, retooling, or reconfigureing.Unrefined = Crude, rough, unsatisfying, not pleasing.  Unrefined = Crude, rough, unsatisfying, not pleasing. Displeasing or unsatisfying is a subjective connotation. I think the Accord felt more \"refined\" than the Legacy but wasn\\'t as fun to drive. The Subie shakes when you turn it on (not like a vibration but you can feel the torque of the starter as the car kicks over) and it makes engine noises when you floor it or rev it.The Honda\\'s handling is also \"more refined\" in that it pretty much understeers no matter what. The Subie will under or oversteer depending on where your foot is.  I left the BMW/MB/Audi/Opel/etc. off because of availability or price. No point in comparing the power train in a $45-75K cart with those in the $20K arena.I have been watching the American LeMans Series and am stunned by the performance and dominance of the Audi TDI. A turbo-diesel is blowing the rest of the field off the courses. Maybe next decade we will all be driving Diesel/Hybrids.  Have any 0-60 times to back that up? ...I can tell you firsthand, the manual will beat it out of the gate every time\"mz6greyghost and lilengineerboy,Fusion V6 6A is just over 7 seconds to 60, correct? I\\'d assume the Mazda6 V6 6A would be pretty much the same (basically same chassis, motor and transmission, roughly the same weight). Now the Mazda6 V6 5M doesn\\'t break into the 6\\'s does it? I\\'ve always read they are in the low 7\\'s.I found this on Consumer Guide, regarding the 2006 models: \"The i versions are acceptably peppy with manual transmission, sluggish with automatic. V6s lively, but need high rpm for maximum punch. Test manual s sedan did 7.5 sec 0-60 mph.\" Even if you can flog one barely under 7, that\\'s still not really much faster than the 6A at just over 7. We\\'re talking 10ths of a second.I could be wrong. My 1998 626 ES-V6 was good for 7.2 0-60. It only had 170hp (by the old standards) but was light by todays standards and geared very, very low (5th gear at 80mph was 4,000 RPM!). I miss that car... The Mazda6 added horsepower, but also several hundred pounds, and isn\\'t geared that low.  Now the Mazda6 V6 5M doesn\\'t break into the 6\\'s does it? I\\'ve always read they are in the low 7\\'s. It used to when the V6 produced 220 HP. C&D clocked their long term V6 MTX at 6.4 seconds. The latest iteration of the 6 with V6 has fewer horses than those of the first year or two though. I don\\'t know what the current time is to 60 with the slightly de-powered engine.  I\\'ve heard that it\\'s not so much \"de-powered\" as just using different metrics to measure power - specifically using SAE standards. To those who keep calling the Mazda 6 engine \"antiquated\", \"rough\", and \"thrashy\", perhaps the less-exagerated way of putting it is \"not as smooth\" or \"not as quiet\" or \"not as efficient\" as some other engines in this class. Remember, this engine/car continues to garner awards like most desired by editors of Edmunds in 2007, sportiest car by consumers digest in 2007, and one of the most desireable cars in Esquire magazine for 2006. Given these awards, it can\\'t be as bad as you describe... As an analogy, since the Accord is slightly behind the Sonata in JD Powers reliablity reports, perhaps you\\'d say the Accord is junk? I\\'d say that this is also an exageration that doesn\\'t stand to reason. Ok, the 6\\'s engine isn\\'t the best, the newest, the quietest, the most efficient, or even the most desireable... but it\\'s still a good enough engine that propels the Mazda 6 to garner a great deal of respect by many auto journalists (who arguably are some of the most passionate people when it comes to cars...after all they have dedicated their livelihoods to that passion!). As a sidenote, I\\'ve spent quite a bit of time with the Subaru boxter engine. With a turbo, that thing makes the legacy exhilarating. But since it\\'s relatively quiet on the inside, it hides how clackity that engine is. Perhaps because the older 6\\'s (I think the 06\\'s and newer are a bit quieter than my 05) didn\\'t have as much sound deadening material as the legacy, it makes the duratec sound less refined than others because you can hear more of it. Personally, I find reving the 6\\'s engine up quite rewarding and not at all objectionable... so to each, their own. As to the 2.3 engine that the 6 has, Motor trend described that engine as follows: \"Mazda\\'s four-cylinder version of the 6--the i--is a willing partner on these curvy roads: a free-revving 2.3-liter, 160-horsepower inline-four joined to a snicky five-speed manual and a driver-focused cockpit, all wrapped in far-spicier-than-vanilla bodywork.... Like its Camry and Accord competitors, the 6i is no rocket off the line, but once the tach tops 3000 rpm, the DOHC powerplant comes on strong, delivering an enthusiastic pull. The standard five-speed manual is one of the most positive shifters around, though we long for another cog. And, yes, you can heel/toe downshift in this family car.The 6 is a joy on curvy roads, quickly taking a set with minimal understeer and negligible bump steer--not something you expect to find in the four-cylinder midsize-sedan category. Mazda thoughtfully includes grippy and supportive bucket seats in the open-feeling interior, which is designed with large, strategically placed knobs, dials, and switches.\"So yeah, the 6\\'s engines aren\\'t class leaders. But they don\\'t deserve to be dogged either. In the end, they are solid components that don\\'t detract from those who value a vehicle that is both comfortable and fun.  I have often read about how the MZ6 has \"only\" 220 hp. My how times have changed. When the Taurus SHO came out in 1989 it had 220 hp and was lauded as an extremely fast sedan; 140 mph top speed. Now almost any sedan can be had with more than 220 hp. Where are we using all this extra horsepower? With gas prices being where they are, it would seem that increased gas mileage would be more important than winning the hp wars.  Yes, they apparently have. The version used in the Fusion and the Mazda 6 makes more horses and torque than the earlier 3.0 liter version of the engine used in the Ford Escape when it initially hit the market. My daughter had one. I\\'ve also ridden in one of the new ford vehicles with the 3.5 Duratec. Performance seemed quite good, and, I noticed no undue NHV when the owner got on it a bit. Do you honestly think that Ford\\'s Premier Automotive Group, Mazda, and domestic Ford aren\\'t sharing engineering info on ways to improve their offerings to the marketplace?Regards:OldCEM  The thing is, many of the high-horsepower cars are getting some of the best mileage estimates (compare the Altima 4-cylinder to the rest of the 4-cylinder class, it has best economy AND acceleration.) The Camry V6 is the same way.Awkwardly however, the vehicles that are lower on power also seem to offer less fuel economy, with the exception of the GM 3.5L pushrod, which does quite well for an engine of its size economywise, although power is only modest.  Very well said. Although we ended up buying an \\'06 5 speed accord, we thought the Mazda was a really nice car, and would have been happy to own one.  There are other exceptions as well. Chrysler\\'s 2.7 and 3.5 V6 engines get exceptional fuel economy as well. I\\'ve owned both sizes and used them for business travel. My last two, both Sebring 2.7 sedans, consistently got 30 - 32 MPG running 75 on interstates. I also have owned a Dodge intrepid 2.7 and a Chrysler LHS with the 3.5 - both got exceptional mileage for as big as they were. I\\'ve also owned 2 Accords, both 4 bangers with manuals, and, neither of them delivered the fuel economy that the Chryslers do. My all - time fuel economy champ remains a 1975 Oldsmobile Starfire with a 3.8 V6 with a two barrel and a 3 speed automatic. The car consistently gave me 38+ MPG. Think [non-permissible content removed] cars are reliable - the Olds went over 250K, and, didn\\'t die until a guy ran a red light and totaled it.Regards:OldCEM  Do you honestly think that Ford\\'s Premier Automotive Group, Mazda, and domestic Ford aren\\'t sharing engineering info on ways to improve their offerings to the marketplace? When will these improvements be realized in the Fusion? When the competition is yet another two or three steps ahead of them.I\\'ve also ridden in one of the new ford vehicles with the 3.5 Duratec. Performance seemed quite good, and, I noticed no undue NHV when the owner got on it a bit.How does the performance of the 3.5 Duratec make the 3.0 Duratec better?  Odd that you got poor mileage in your Accords. I get 38-40 MPG on strictly highway in my 2006 Accord, and that\\'s with an automatic at 70 MPH. The old one, a 1996, will return 31 MPG at that speed, with A/C. Not bad for a 4-speed that turns 2,800 RPM at 70 MPH.We have had to Chryslers, one with a 2.4L 4-cyl (Sebring) and one with the 2.7L. Both cars had transmission issues (refusing to back up on many occasions), and the second one (2.4L) had suspension issues that confused the dealer for 4 months. A horrible creaking/groaning that they heard but could never find. My family traded the car with 35k miles, since the warrany was about to expire and we knew we\\'d be upside down in repair bills soon after that occurred. I remember the 2.4L was pathetically powered for that car, with something between 11 and 12 seconds to 60 MPH. The Sebring convertible is a HEAVY car. I can\\'t say I remember the mileage they returned (these were some years ago).And yes, I think \"[non-permissible content removed] cars\" as you call them are reliable as a whole. My other daily driver is a 1996 Accord LX with 172,000 miles on it. Hasn\\'t left me stranded a day in its life (which started in my family in November of 1995). Pretty reliable to me. So was my granddad\\'s 260k mile Civic which he sold for $1,000. Not saying other cars aren\\'t reliable though, just that our \"[non-permissible content removed] cars\" have been the epitomy of reliable transportation, and that I\\'ve seen no evidence that tells me my Accord should be any different.  My other daily driver is a 1996 Accord LX with 172,000 miles on it. Hasn\\'t left me stranded a day in its life (which started in my family in November of 1995)Yeah we got a raw deal. The Accord displaced the previous record holder (\\'83 Reliant) for most times on a hook, and it still doesn\\'t have the miles yours does.The new \"world\" 2.4 seems pretty cool, the Hyundai/Mitsu/DC motor looks cool. I would hardly consider that domestic though, being a Japanese company, a Korean company, and a German company.  Thanks for your impressions of the 2.3, benderofbows. I did not really drive the Mazda6 with Ford\\'s V6 enough to form much of an impression of it. If you had put the 2.3 in the \"unrefined\" category, then I\\'d have had to discount your impression of the V6, since I am happy with the 4 (I would not mind more torque off the line, of course).The ford V6 I have driven is the old 3.8L, in our Windstar. Now that engine really makes you worry when it revs. OTOH, these \"antiquated\" pushrod engines seem to generate lots of low end torque...225 ft-lbs at only 3000 rpm in that 3.8L, which is also satisfying in its own way.  had the experience to drive a new ML320 CDI recently, close to 5000 lbs of SUV. No diesel clatter or other associated ill behavior and the thing \\'felt\\' quick, and indeed is considering the vehicle weight. A rather unusual amount of compression braking though when you let off the gas. Owner was reporting high 20s mpg in strictly big city driving. Remarkable drivetrain that is now available in a mid size \\'E\\', expensive as it may be. Honda is reportedly also working on a \\'clean\\' diesel, but I agree the diesel and/or the diesel hybrid may be where we are heading.  as being illustrated by many of these new V6s - with the increased efficiencies (HP) also comes the increased FE. The two seem to go together. The Toyota 2GR-FS, which I have argued is the most advanced in this group, was originally rated at 280HP (pre the 06 SAE changes) - added 500cc of displacement, some torque, about 80 HP, and a coupla three mpg. From Toyota\\'s standpoint, if they can produce something that wins both the HP and FE \\'wars\\' they would be foolish not to - because both SELL. Besides which, for those folks that put a high priority on FE, the 4 bangers and the hybrids are available. A can\\'t lose situation for the auto buyer?  but was light by todays standards and geared very, very low (5th gear at 80mph was 4,000 RPM!). the weight would be the thing - but 4000 rpm for 80? 4 banger territory these days and would be actually be high for any of the V6s in this group. My 2GR Toyota with a 5 speed auto is at 2700 for 80 mph and would suggest to you that some of those \\'old\\' 3.8s are turning even less than that.  \" I get 38-40 MPG on strictly highway in my 2006 Accord, and that\\'s with an automatic at 70 MPH.\"Wow... that\\'s more than what I get. What\\'s the key? Weather? Tires? The way you drive?Enjoy the great mileage   The key word there is \"Strictly\" highway. That means, I fill up at a gas station along the interstate (my usual trips put me on I-65), and fill up within a couple of miles of getting off the interstate. Once I hit my steady speed (70-75 MPG typically), I usually go the ENTIRE trip without ever summoning a downshift, so revs stay at a constant 2,400 or so. These trips were in cooler months with no A/C as well, and never more than two of us in the car. A/C seems to knock 1 MPG off of my regular numbers.So, conditions were very conducive to excellent mileage. My typical mileage on my regular route is 29-30 MPG, with 14 miles of interstate, 12 miles of two-lane/four-lane streets. Conservative acceleration is common (rarely topping 3,500 RPM except when I want a grin ). My dad had a car similar to mine (a 2005 version of the same car), and drove much more aggressively, and in return, averaged about 5 MPG less than I would get on trips. He is constantly summoning a downshift to pass or accelerate, though. Driving style is HUGE in mileage.I\\'m planning a trip to Oklahoma again soon, and will report on the mileage I get on that 1,500 mile trip. It\\'ll be hot (May) and the car will be loaded.  \"The ford V6 I have driven is the old 3.8L, in our Windstar.

It had 140 HP, same as the 3.slow as someone called it, but its torque was wonderful--it never sounded or felt strained, simply jumped ahead whenever I needed the extra go. Just proves that because time goes by, things don\\'t automatically improve. Ford dropped its availability in the redesigned \\'96-forward Taurus and made do with two 3.slows--they both had to scream and rev for even the least increase in speed because they had no torque available. No wonder Taurus became the King of Rentals from then on...  I\\'ve heard that it\\'s not so much \"de-powered\" as just using different metrics to measure power - specifically using SAE standards.That could very well be the case too. It would certainly explain why C&D has not done a performance test on the 6 since 2004 IMO. Why re-test if nothing really changed?  There has been much debate surrounding this topic. NVH-wise, I believe some of the engines in this class have performed very well in terms dB. Off the top of my head, and based on my experiences, I would say the 3.3L from Hyundai is probably one the quietest, if not the, out of the V6 engines in this class. Toyota\\'s 3.5L and Honda\\'s 3.0L is not far behind in terms of dB.  \"To those who keep calling the Mazda 6 engine \"antiquated\", \"rough\", and \"thrashy\", perhaps the less-exaggerated way of putting it is \"not as smooth\" or \"not as quiet\" or \"not as efficient\" as some other engines in this class...

But they don\\'t deserve to be dogged either.\"zzzoom6,Excellent post about the Mazda6.I apologize if I came across as exaggerating or dogging the Ford/Mazda 3.0L, that was not my intent. I was merely comparing, and yes you are correct in that instead of saying \"rough\" and \"thrashy\" as compared to ___, one can say \"less smooth\" etc. I\\'ve owned two Mazdas, a 1991 626 and a 1998 626 V6, both very good cars (and both stick shifts). I haven\\'t driven the Mazda6 \"s\" 5-speed manual because, as I mentioned, all the performance numbers which I had seen for it (low-7 seconds manual, about 8 seconds 5A, mid-7 seconds 6A) were not too different manual versus 6-speed auto. When shopping I drove Fusion 2.3L 5M, Fusion 3.0L 6A, and Mazdaspeed6. If I had known mid-6 second runs were possible with the 3.0L 5M, I\\'d have definitely tried one before buying the Accord 2.4L 5M. The Accord feels quick to me but certainly not sub-7 quick. It can and has outrun Mazda6 \"s\" 6-speed automatics. (That\\'s the only disagreement I have with your post, my Accord 4-cyl is considerably faster than the Mazda6/Fusion 2.3L, at mid-7 seconds versus low-9 seconds to 60).I was just focusing on one area: trying to define engine refinement and giving examples. Of course this is just one small factor to evaluate! I agree that the 6 is an excellent car with many class-leading qualities. I\\'d love to have the clean, well-designed and attractive \"5th-door\" hatchback in my Accord, not to mention the 6\\'s handling. Also, I will be thrilled if my Accord has the reliability record of my old 1998 626: over 100,000 miles with only scheduled maintenance and wear item replacements. When it comes right down to it, all else equal, I\\'d take better performance for slightly less \"refinement.\" I chose the Accord mostly for value (purchase price and resale), its blend of refinement and performance/handling, and record of reliability. But as you said, to each his own, and I\\'m happy. Would I also be happy with a 6? Of course.I assume you have a 6? Want to trade cars for a weekend?   That\\'d be fun actually! Seems most of my friends have gravitated toward SUV\\'s rather than cars, so I haven\\'t spent a whole lot of time in an Accord since I test drove them over a year ago. Honda continues to improve their cars, and considering the high level they\\'ve been at for quite some time, that says a lot about their commitment to excellence. I only hope that in the long run, my Mazda 6 holds up as well as my previous accords. 16 months so far, and I have had no major problems (had a rattle fixed and a blown speaker replaced under warranty). But if all continues to go well, I\\'m sure I will have this car for several more years. your posts have been quite civil and described well so no worries about hard feelings.  Let me step in, if I may, since I\\'m also a 6 owner (S sedan, 5-speed manual). I haven\\'t driven the Mazda6 \"s\" 5-speed manual because, as I mentioned, all the performance numbers which I had seen for it (low-7 seconds manual, about 8 seconds 5A, mid-7 seconds 6A) were not too different manual versus 6-speed auto. When shopping I drove Fusion 2.3L 5M, Fusion 3.0L 6A, and Mazdaspeed6.I bet you wouldn\\'t have paid much more (if any) if you bought the MazdaSpeed 6 compared to your Accord, since they\\'re practically giving them away.If I had known mid-6 second runs were possible with the 3.0L 5M, I\\'d have definitely tried one before buying the Accord 2.4L 5M.You\\'re right, it\\'s no barn-burner, but mid-6-second 0-60 is almost the norm for the V6 with 5-speed. The low-end punch is lacking a little IMO, but over 3000 RPM, it really moves. Dropping a gear to pass on the highway is almost TOO easy, and fun BTW!(That\\'s the only disagreement I have with your post, my Accord 4-cyl is considerably faster than the Mazda6/Fusion 2.3L, at mid-7 seconds versus low-9 seconds to 60).A slight correction. The low-9 seconds to 60 MPH that you refer to is for the Mazda 6 with the 2.3L and automatic. With the manual, I believe you\\'re looking at mid- to high-7s, same as the V6 with automatic.When it comes right down to it, all else equal, I\\'d take better performance for slightly less \"refinement.\" ... Would I also be happy with a 6? Of course.I like how you think.  I bought my 6 in \\'04, after repeatedly test-driving it, an Accord coupe (V6, 5-speed manual), an Altima 3.5SE (V6, 5-speed manual), and a Legacy GT (limited with manual). In the end, each had it\\'s flaws, but the 6 won me over on the not-so-bad V6 power, excellent handling, great styling and an inexpensive price. The Accord was smooth, powerful, and styled nicely, but the 2-door is impractical for me, and at the time, the only V6, 5-speed manual combo from the factory was the coupe (but yes, I know it\\'s available on the 4-door now.) The Altima wasn\\'t bad. Excellent power with the V6, but the body-roll while cornering almost gave me motion-sickness. The torque-steer was terrible, especially during cornering, and the interior was cheap-looking and cheap-feeling to me. Apparently, the \\'08s have fixed all that, but I haven\\'t driven one yet.The Legacy had AWD, but you can feel it\\'s extra weight from the instant you hit the gas. The 4-cyl was okay, but I know I\\'d get terrible gas mileage with the AWD. And I could never get comfortable in the driver\\'s seat, no matter what position I tried.I assume you have a 6? Want to trade cars for a weekend?I do. And no, sorry!   4000 rpm for 80? 4 banger territory these days and would be actually be high for any of the V6s in this group. My 2GR Toyota with a 5 speed auto is at 2700 for 80 mph and would suggest to you that some of those \\'old\\' 3.8s are turning even less than that.I forgot to mention, that motor was a screamer! Redline was 7,000 RPM, but it would readily and willingly surpass that- I was a couple of hundred RPMs into it by accident a few times and the rev limiter never interfered, and this one time...My wife will KILL me if she ever sees this, but... When driving a stick she used to get nervous and try to do everything too fast, even though I taught her it doesn\\'t matter how slow you operate the clutch and gear shifter, always better to take your time.One late, late night she was driving it and merging onto an empty highway. She ran it out pretty high in first gear, shifted very quick to second and ran it out to make the jump into 3rd... and instead, went right back into first and dropped the clutch. Talk about a motor \"screaming\" !!! I couldn\\'t see exactly from the passenger seat but it was WAAAAAY in the red, over 7,500 RPMs. I can still hear the sound. Maybe the limiter finally stepped in and saved my butt that time, lol.But everything was fine, no ill effects. It had almost 100,000 miles on it at that point, too. It\\'s still ticking along somewhere I\\'m sure, the last time I spoke to the guy I sold it to he had no complaints. Take that 3.8 above 7,500 and see what happens!  I bet you wouldn\\'t have paid much more (if any) if you bought the MazdaSpeed 6 compared to your Accord, since they\\'re practically giving them away.Yea I thought about that, they had the one I drove marked at $23,000 and that was last year. That\\'s only a few grand more than my Accord was. But, insurance and speeding tickets would have been much, much more I can\\'t restrain myself well. It\\'s more fun for me to run my Accord 4-cylinder hard than it was for me to drive that 2005 Mustang GT (which I had from a local dealer for two days when the wife wanted to upgrade) because of having to refrain from taking advantage of the power. You could floor it in one gear and that was it, fun was over or you\\'re looking at a BIG TIME ticket or accident. Oh, and this is a little off topic but speaking of engine refinement, the Mustang story reminded me... my wife currently drives a 2004 Mustang with the 3.9L V6, and it makes the DT30 seem like a BMW six.  I can\\'t restrain myself well. It\\'s more fun for me to run my Accord 4-cylinder hard than it was for me to drive that 2005 Mustang GT (which I had from a local dealer for two days when the wife wanted to upgrade) because of having to refrain from taking advantage of the power. You could floor it in one gear and that was it, fun was over or you\\'re looking at a BIG TIME ticket or accident. LOL!!! I\\'m having that very problem right now. Coming from a Mazda6 S with a stick I was used to being able to floor it for 2 or 3 gears when merging onto a highway (Yes from a stop because the drivers around here can\\'t merge for anything :sick: ) and I\\'d still be at a reasonably safe speed. With my current Mustang GT I\\'m doing 80 before I\\'m even at redline in 2nd gear. It\\'s really hard getting used to that sensation but boy is it fun! I just make sure the coast is really clear before doing that. Otherwise I \"granny\" it.   sorry I guess I misunderstood what you were calling \\'low\\'. But, in any case, I find it hard to believe that any V6 especially one with a Ford label, would run out past 7000 rpm. If so, it certainly can\\'t be related to the 3.0 DT. The 2GR Toyota has a 6500 redline, the tranny will hold right to redline with any sort of encouragement, so much so, that you find yourself bouncing off the rev limiter simply because it (the rev increase) is so transparent and quick. As far as that 3.8 at 7500 - can you say schrapnel?   a 2004 Mustang with the 3.9L V6, and it makes the DT30 seem like a BMW sixthe curse of the pushrod???.  Isn\\'t the 04 Mustang V6 the 3.8? We have the 3.8 in my wife\\'s 2000 Windstar. My lawnmower or weedwacker (take your pick) are smoother than that Ford 3.8.  The thing is, many of the high-horsepower cars are getting some of the best mileage estimates (compare the Altima 4-cylinder to the rest of the 4-cylinder class, it has best economy AND acceleration.) thats the cvt doing that. I would look for it to show up in more cars over the years because of that. It takes a couple hundred miles to get used to it, but once you do, its quite an amazing bit of technology.  Isn\\'t the 04 Mustang V6 the 3.8?My niece has an 04 Mustang convertible V6. That is one pitiful engine. I know it\\'s larger displacement than my 03 V6 Accord (3.0). The performance is sad, for a sports car.  Hey thegraduate,I\\'ve noticed that my 2006 Accord SE 4 auto. has gotten better mpg. I bought the car last June new and it has about 12,000 miles. Starting at about 7,000 miles the car consistently rewarded me with over 30 miles to the gallon (Over 33 miles on one trip to Monterey, CA and going over 450 miles before the light came on). I use the car primarily on the freeway with trips about 70 miles or so. At times in some streches, its stop and go on the freeway and speed no higher than 25.As far as the new, 2008 Accord, the vtec.net site had some good information about the 4s and 6s (albeit perhaps highly speculative). I don\\'t think Honda will increase the hp of the 4 by that much though - usually its 10. Look for a boost in fuel economy and additional safety items.  The 4 banger accords gave me less than expected mileage because I live in the mountains. I had to constantly downshift to maintain interstate speeds, especially if I was carrying passengers and luggage.Never said the Chryslers were reliable - my last 2 have been terrible, but, they do get great gas mileage.My experience with Japanese cars - my first Accord was great, the second was a lemon. Two of my kids bought Civics, and, with much interstate driving, the engines in both were pretty much shot by 90K. My other kid has tried a Toyota MR2, a Nissan Sentra, and a Hyundai Excel. The MR2 and the Sentra were money pits, but, the Hyundai went 146K with minimal repairs. Do I think Toyotas and Hondas are reliable - Sure, but, I\\'ve also gotten similar reliabilty out of most of the Ford, GM, and Chrysler cars I\\'ve owned. IMO I think Ford and GM have gotten much better of late, and, Chrysler seems to have gotten worse.Regards:OldCem  The 4 banger accords gave me less than expected mileage because I live in the mountains. I had to constantly downshift to maintain interstate speeds, especially if I was carrying passengers and luggage. Ah, that makes perfect sense. Hondas aren\\'t known well for low-end torque for good reason; until lately, they simply didn\\'t have much of it. Top end power was plentiful in most models, but below 3,000 RPM, not a whole lot would typically go on. This is true in my 1996 Accord (although my 2006 is plenty torquey with peak torque a good deal lower than the older models as well). You probably get the best mileage out of high-torque, lower hp engines in your conditions. In mine, the Honda balance works much better.  Easiest way for Ford to make up ground with the competition is to do exactly what Chrysler did with its midsize - stuff the 3.5 in it coupled to a 6 speed tranny, and, make the two smaller engines available as lower cost options. I\\'ve not driven a 3.0 Fusion yet, so I don\\'t know if its supposed NHV problems are real or not. Plan to drive one as soon as I start shopping for a replacement for my business driver Sebring.Regards:OldCEM  Not sure how interstate driving renders an engine \"shot\". But my neighbor had an MR2 that he put 180,000+ miles on it, rarely had any work done to it, redlined the hell out of it, and when he sold it it ran so smooth that you couldn\\'t tell the engine was even running when it idled.My colleague\\'s Hyundai Excel was a POS. A joke. My Ford experiences have been disappointing. I\\'ve gone Japanese for many years now and have never been disappointed.  My colleague\\'s Hyundai Excel was a POS. A joke. Relevance? The Excel was a subcompact, last sold in the U.S. in 1994.  Relevance? actually a whole lot of relevance - despite the Sonata being a much better car by all measures, experiences like this underline the reputation issues that Hyundai still faces - and therefore effects not only the price that these vehicles command but also the resale values later. On the other side of the coin, Toyota and Honda, in particular, will continue to enjoy the honeymoon they have been on for years, even in the event that their cars prove to be unremarkable.  \"Toyota and Honda, in particular, will continue to enjoy the honeymoon they have been on for years, even in the event that their cars prove to be unremarkable.\"The fact the Honda cars are unremarkable is interesting due to the fact Honda keeps beating the competition with old designs to new designs. If Hondas\\' cars are unremarkable it makes Hyundais\\' cars non-existent.   in the event that their cars prove to be unremarkable.is what I said, the last thing that I would tell you that even in its current form - that the Accord is \\'unremarkable\\', the point was that if by some magical wave of the wand, the Honda became even an \\'average\\' car, the preception that it is still among the best will last long after thereafter. Same thng applies, incidentally to the Camry, IMO.  I have been so impressed by my two Accords (for 16 years), that I will keep buying them, until one fails to meet expectations. Many others will do the same, I suspect. Frankly no other car company has a chance, until an Accord fails me. When I find what I want, I don\\'t keep looking.  stuff the 3.5 in it coupled to a 6 speed tranny, and, make the two smaller engines available as lower cost optionsI think Ford\\'s PR dept. would tell you that this is exactly what they are going to do - the beancounters are the ones that may have a problem with it...  if it ain\\'t broke, why should you fix it! I think your attitude is shared with many many Accord owners, and not something that you will find too much amongst Malibu owners, for example.  stick with what works. Its the same reason i stick with the nissans. 3 of them so far, 380,000 miles (and the altima only has 1500) and never been left on the side of the road, or not made it somewhere because a car wouldn\\'t start.And as for the civic\\'s that somebody said were dieing at 90k, did you ever change the oil or maintain them? Though I prefer my nissan\\'s, I\\'ve got to give Honda credit. They do build one heck of car. the 2002 civic my wife drives has 110,000 on it, and has never needed anything but schedulded timing belt change somewhere around 100k. and it runs perfect  stick with what works. Its the same reason i stick with the nissans. 3 of them so far, 380,000 miles (and the altima only has 1500) and never been left on the side of the road, or not made it somewhere because a car wouldn\\'t start.Congrats on your good fortune. I find that the SR20 would pop a head gasket around 95-105k and the transmissions would start popping out of 5th gear somewhere in that time frame too. In its day, that was a great motor. I know the 2.5l had some issues early on but those seem to be resolved, and if the VQ didn\\'t require premium unleaded, that great 6 would be on my list as well.  Just to set the record straight. Both Civics were used by my kids to run back and forth to college. Both were serviced every 3K miles using Castrol GTX. Both of them were burning excessive amounts of oil by the time 90K rolled around and needed their valve trains rebuilt. One of them developed a crack in its exhaust manifold orignating from the Ox. sensor fitting as well. The dealer wanted $1000 to fix it. One good thing - they did have decent resale value when I dumped them.Regards:OldCEM  Relevance? actually a whole lot of relevance - despite the Sonata being a much better car by all measures, experiences like this underline the reputation issues that Hyundai still faces... From Post #1:Let\\'s see if we can start off with some ground rules so that it is abundantly clear what this topic is about. Well, duh, it\\'s about midsize sedans. But here is what it is not about: * manufacturers issues... Based on that, I comsider Hyundai\\'s reputation based on late \\'80s-early \\'90s subcompact to be irrelevent to this discussion. People who haven\\'t had their heads in the sand since the mid-\\'90s realize that the Sonata is very competitive in the mid-sized class, in both capabilities and reliability.  The 2.5 and 3.0 Duratec derivatives that I\\'ve owned both redlined at 6500 as well, and, would get there quite quickly. My Chrysler 2.7 redlines at 6500 also, but, is not happy.Regards:OldCEM  Very simple - Interstate driving here in the mountains where I live means a Civic 4 banger with automatic spends its life at high RPM an excessive amount of time, because that\\'s where its power band is. The engines simply wore out.Regards:OldCEM  Is there a \"4 banger\" you feel would have lasted longer, under these conditions? To kind of switch this to midsize sedans, I think Accord 4 bangers would have held up better.  You may want to check this outDashboard is so not Toyota  You may want to check this out ewwwww(3074), I think most of us have seen a camry; as one of the best selling cars, it\\'s hardly a secret. Even though it\\'s only been out for a year, they are everywhere...if you see the same thing over and over and over and over again, I think by default it becomes a bit boring despite having an amusingly large bulbous nose. And btw...it seems you\\'re picturing a car that is not even available here...the taillights on your pic are completely wrong for US models. Why show us something that is not available here? yawn, those pics make me tired. Time to go to bed...  As you can tell from the URL in the background of the last shot, those photos were taken in China. I think with most modern cars, a properly maintained vehicle will last far beyond 100K miles, regardless of brand. Preventive maintenance is the key, not only with oil changes, but everything else.  Camry: 42,000Accord: 36,000Altima: 27,000Prius: 19,000Fusion: 16,000Malibu: 14,000G6: 12,000Sonata: 11,000At this point, it seems unlikely that any car in the near future is going to unseat the Camry, especially with the Subaru factory in Indiana gearing up to produce 100,000 more a year (but I do wonder if Toyota really can sell more than 500,000 of this car a year). The Accord is a solid but distant second, and the Altima is a solid but distant third. The big surprises to me at this point are two: The Prius is now #4, and saw sales increase by 130% over the previous year. The second surprise is how far down the list the Sonata is, and even more shocking is that sales are down 40% from last year\\'s pace.  The Accord could easily overtake the Camry when the all-new Accord debuts later this year. The current model is five years old; the Camry was recently redesigned. Also, the Camry\\'s numbers include a large number of sales to fleets; almost all the Accord\\'s numbers are to individuals. The limitation with the Accord will be production, as you noted.Hyundai has deliberately cut back on Sonata sales to fleets this year, so that is part of the reason for the dropoff from last year, when many Sonatas went into fleets. Also, incentives have been lower so far this year than last year, when they were $3000 total for most of the year on V6 models.The Prius has had incentives for the first time recently, and $3.00+ a gallon gas doesn\\'t hurt Prius sales either.Malibu numbers should pick up later this year also, when the all-new and improved Malibu comes out.  I know this is superficial, but I\\'ve gotten used to if there is a half-moon cut-out for a chrome exhaust tip on one side, then there ought to be a matching one on the other side, or the exhaust should just be hidden. I know this is a 2.0 engined car, so it\\'s not going to have duals. I know the Altima 2.5-3.5 don\\'t have real duals, but I like the way they finally made nice-looking dual chrome tips in the rear valance instead of playing around like they did so many years with a little cut-out on one side with two pipes turned down and so on. That\\'s one of the things that I found strange on the Mazdaspeed 3--here\\'s this high performance car with a half-moon cut out on one side with a big chrome tip in the rear, just begging to be balanced with one on the other side.  The people who bought the 2.5 Altima may not be as excited about the dual exhaust outlets, if they ever have to have the exhaust system replaced (added expense). I see no real reason to have the dual outlets on V6 engines, except for \"looks\". Not so long ago, even V8 cars had single exhaust. I do agree, it looks cool though. I wonder how much more the 07 2.5 Altima exhaust cost, than the 06 system did.  Exhaust systems are all stainless these days aren\\'t they? They last a really long time...the life of the vehicle in many (most?) cases. I like the dual look on my 4 cyl Mazda6. This only adds one small muffler and a bit of pipe, not a big deal, if it ever needs replacing. I have found that exhaust system work is a lot cheaper if you find a place that will weld in new parts, rather than going to Midas, et. al. and having them sell you an entire new system, because that is all they are set up to do.  The muffler on my old Accord lasted about 5 years. The factory muffler was $220 (not including installation). If I would have to replace two of them, I would have been looking at double that $440. Of course, if you don\\'t keep the car that long, it becomes the next guy\\'s problem. But it will cost more, sooner or later, for whoever has to change it.  The exhaust systems on my Lesabres have lasted 10 years and were doing fine on the one car I did trade.  The exhaust system on my Accord bought new in Nov. 1995 is still on there today, 172,000 miles later.I could count on one hand the number of times it has been driven in snow, however, so salt/rust isn\\'t a problem.  My old Accord had never been driven in snow either, but the muffler had a hole in it, and the pipe going to the muffler also had a hole (where it goes over the suspension). That\\'s why I decided to buy the factory muffler, it included the pipe going to the muffler, and was an easy bolt-on. They don\\'t all last forever. The truck (96 chevy) I drive to work has dual exhaust too, and the exhaust is shot. It will have to be changed soon. I may just go with single this time. Maybe both are a result of short distance driving. The moisture stays in the exhaust pipe, and eventually rusts it out from the inside.  172k miles grad. Wow! That exhaust has to have a hole in it somewhere.  my nissan 200sx has original exhaust on it. thats 150k miles over 9 years. its driven in rain and snow ever year.  I doubt it would be easy. the 2008 model will undoubtly cost more, and those 1500-2000 dollar rebates everybody here says honda is offering will dissapear. $2000 rebates have got to be helping prop the sales up a bit.  If all mufflers lasted that long, Midas (among others) would be out of business. I hear a lot of cars pass my house every day, and many of them need a new muffler.  Why? I just wanna show you guys a Japan version of Camry. They have better cars that the US does. It is relatively sporty, don\\'t you think? I don\\'t understand why the US version of Japanese cars are always worse except the engine size  Friends, mufflers and exhaust pipes rust from the inside out. Driving in rain or snow has no more affect than driving exclusively in a desert.  That\\'s why I think repeated short distance drives are the reason my exhaust didn\\'t last very long (5-6 years).  Elroy, I agree. Those short trips don\\'t allow the exhaust to heat up sufficiently to \"burn off\" the moisture in the exhaust gas.  Yes, short trips and the resultant moisture in the exhaust system, is what kills mufflers, cats, and all exhaust parts. It\\'s also not very good on engines.The factory muffler was $220 - ouch. I stopped buying exhaust parts, or systems, at the dealer a long time ago. I found a source of truly OEM parts - made by exactly the same vendor that supplies to Honda, etc. - but, at a fraction of the cost. I recently replaced my entire exhaust system from the exhaust manifold to the exhaust time, including the cat, for less than $300. Of course, I did the dirty work myself, and labor is a significant part of exhaust work.  well, mine has lasted that long, and it is the longest i\\'ve ever kept a muffler on a car. My inspection sticker expires this month, so I\\'ll let you know if it passes. I\\'ll also be watching my rear brakes. They\\'re original too. I figured they\\'d need replacing last year, but they didn\\'t.But, the short distance thing may explain it. 80% of that cars miliage is to and from work. thats about 25 miles each way with hardly any lights or stop signs and little (if any) traffic. about 22 of those 25 miles are 60mph crusing.  Camry: 42,000 Accord: 36,000 Altima: 27,000 Prius: 19,000 Fusion: 16,000 Malibu: 14,000 G6: 12,000 Sonata: 11,000 Wow. Only 11,000 Sonatas sold in March!? Where are all the pundits from 6 months ago that were predicting the Sonata would sell huge and move way up this list?What amazes me is the Accord can still sell 36,000 units with a wheezing design and style. Unbelievable market acceptance. When the 08 Accord debuts - watch out.  Wow. Only 11,000 Sonatas sold in March!? Where are all the pundits from 6 months ago that were predicting the Sonata would sell huge and move way up this list?I was thinking the same thing. Where are they now? One car does not make a reputation, it seems.  That\\'s why I think repeated short distance drives are the reason my exhaust didn\\'t last very long (5-6 years).Hondas are the only cars I\\'ve been responsible for where I had to replace an exhaust system.Its not a killer expense, its not going to make me love one brand and hate another, but its interesting.  What amazes me is the Accord can still sell 36,000 units with a wheezing design and style. Unbelievable market acceptance. When the 08 Accord debuts - watch out. might have something to do with huge rebates you can get on them. If they can maintain their 17% or so increases selling at sticker..............then that will be something. and toyota might have to watch out.and, I wouldn\\'t call the design or style wheezing. I think the current sales may be a testament to how ahead of its time the last redesign was.  The cat, or any other part of the exhaust, was never changed in 12 years, and 140k miles. Only the parts farthest from the heat of the engine, where the moisture took longer to evaporate. The metal termites are having a feast on my Chevy truck exhaust, because I drive less than one mile to and from work twice a day. But I\\'m not exactly going to drive around town for 5 more miles (burning more gas), to save my exhaust.  I\\'m inclined to agree with you. I think the larger Accord 4 holds up better. I\\'ve owned 4 other 4 cylinder cars that held up better here than the Civics did. Three of them were Ford Escorts, the other was a German built Ford Fiesta.Regards:OldCEM  I cannot find the post. Someone said the Honda Accord 5spd I4 was considerbly faster than the 5spd I4 Fusion? Car and Driver posts a 0-60 of 8.1 seconds for the Fusion I4 5spd. What is it for the Accord? The lowest I find is a 8.0 for a Honda Accord 5spd I4. Now really much difference?? :confuse:  What about Milan sales?  I don\\'t believe in sales numbers. Because McDonalds sells more burgers than Wendys does that make McDonalds a better burger? Nope.Case in point the Car and Driver shootout between Camry/Accord/Fusion. I hope Fusion/Milan sales stay down. I would much rather see Ford continue to build a quality car at a great value and maintain the quality.  172k miles grad. Wow! That exhaust has to have a hole in it somewhere. Well, since short trips have a harmful effect on the muffler, the fact that the car ran 35 mile trips, twice a day, five days a week, for 6 years (and 115k miles of its life), probably has something to do with it. The car doesn\\'t sound any different than it did when I got it. I can put the car running on youtube one day (after finals! i\\'m swamped with school right now!) so you can hear it. If it has any holes, they aren\\'t affecting the \"muffling\" effect!   I don\\'t believe in sales numbers. Because McDonalds sells more burgers than Wendys does that make McDonalds a better burger? Nope. Nope, it just means it offers what people value most. Better is subjective. A better car for you was definitely not a better car for me, and vice versa.  Because McDonalds sells more burgers than Wendys does that make McDonalds a better burger? Nope.Mcdonalds sells more burgers than Wendy\\'s because they are CHEAPER. Can you guess why less Fusions are sold than Accords? They\\'re not cheaper, so there must be another reason. Hint: BECAUSE THEY ARE BETTER.. I hope Fusion/Milan sales stay down.You don\\'t have to hope for it. It will happen anyway.Case in point the Car and Driver shootout between Camry/Accord/Fusion.Hahahaha, that\\'s funny. Name a company who didn\\'t win a comparison they paid for.  Case in point the Car and Driver shootout between Camry/Accord/Fusion. In the magazine articles I\\'ve read (the real thing, not the commercials), the aging Accord beat out the Fusion. The Fusion scored well, but the Accord simply scored better (on things like interior finish, engine performance, engine NVH).  What is the point of this forum?Praise \"Honda\" and do bashing & mocking \"Hyundai\"same old same old. I think it is time to close again.People never learn from mistake. :mad:  thats because the accord is a better car than the fussion, period. The accord, however, is going to run you 3k+ more to buy. and that will probably increase quite a bit when the 2008 accords show up. And I doubt its ever going to change. Ford is just more concerned about their trucks than anything else. You never find outdated engines or technology in them. They\\'re constantly investing time, money, and engineering skill on improving the F seris truck, and as a result, are by far the best truck you can buy.But when it comes to cars, ford just isn\\'t as concerned. At least not in north america. If it hadn\\'t been for the run up in gas prices, and the resulting double digit decreases in truck/suv sales, ford would still be a comfortable #2 in the auto industry.  As has been mentioned, miles are not really much of a factor in exhaust system life. Time and short trips are the bigger factors, I would think the climate can have an effect too, as it takes longer to heat everything up in cold weather.Are there differences in the quality of exhaust systems? We had an \\'89 Voyager, the exhaust system was still good at the end of the vehicles life (12 years) and we do have winter here in WI. Kids have \\'95 and \\'96 Contours. The \\'95 had one pipe replaced and the \\'96 had the resonator replaced.In contrast a \\'91 Nissan Sentra we used to have, needed a lot of exhaust system work done to it over time. Reminded me of the old days, when a new exhaust system every 3 years seemed typical.I have assumed that by now, these midsize cars have all stainless exhaust. Is this a correct assumption...does anyone know od exceptions to that? Also are there perhaps differences in the quality of the stainless steel used?  Who was it? I cannot find the post. Someone said the Honda Accord 5spd I4 was considerbly faster than the 5spd I4 Fusion? Car and Driver posts a 0-60 of 8.1 seconds for the Fusion I4 5spd. What is it for the Accord? The lowest I find is a 8.0 for a Honda Accord 5spd I4. Now really much difference?? It was me. Someone pointed out that I mistakenly posted the time for an automatic Fusion 4-cyl, at 9.36 seconds according to Consumer Reports. Mainly I was going on my experience of actually test driving both cars.Car and Driver just confirmed my feeling that a 4-cylinder manual Accord runs zero to sixty in 7.5 seconds, winning 6th place in what they call \"The quickest cars of 2007: less than $20,000.\" That would put it 0.6 seconds faster than a similiar Fusion (which didn\\'t make the top 10).http://www.caranddriver.com/features/12848/2007-honda-accord.html\"If a pro athlete made it onto the all-star squad 21 times, you&#146;d either call him Your Holiness or on steroids. In the last quarter-century, the Honda Accord has qualified for 10Best honors in all but four years, yet it&#146;s never landed on that list by dint of force.Instead, the Accord earns accolades for being relentlessly agile and fluid. It offers a cushy ride but never wallows. Its steering is light but insistently transmits little e-mails informing of road texture and available grip. The 166-horse i-VTEC four delivers right-now throttle response and squirts to its redline like a spaniel fetching a mallard. The clutch is nearly frictionless&#151;no problem holding it through an entire red light. And the shifter is easy to read&#151;slick and positive, such that you make heel-and-toe downshifts not because you have to but because Mr. Honda figured you might want to.After sampling decades&#146; worth of Accords, we&#146;ll just fall back on all the hackneyed descriptors: Solid. Dependable. An ergonomic all-star. Voted most likely to hold its value.Of course, we weren&#146;t contemplating resale values when an Accord prevailed in a recent comparo earlier this year. We were just thinking about what we&#146;d most like to drive.\"  What is the point of this forum? Praise \"Honda\" and do bashing & mocking \"Hyundai\" Merely pointing out that the Sonata doesn\\'t sell like the Hyundai clubbers projected, and that the Accord still delivers huge sales, even with its dated design. Is that a bash? Its calling a spade a spade.Sorry I like Hondas(as do thousands of others). There\\'s a reason for my skew. I apologize.  I wonder how many people in this discussion (v1.0) beat up Hyundai for selling too many Sonatas to fleets, and now are beating them up because they have reduced sales to fleets in an attempt to raise transaction prices and improve resale values.Keep in mind also that with Santa Fes selling briskly, around 8500 last month (more than a 100% increase over last year), Sonata production for the North American market (in the Alabama plant) is gated at about 25,000 per month less Santa Fe production. So that puts a limit of about 16,000 on Sonatas per month, less if Hyundai increases Santa Fe production to meet growing demand. The Sonata will not come close to outselling the likes of Accord, Camry, and Altima in the forseeable future; there simply aren\\'t enough Sonatas available. Maybe Hyundai could ship some from the ROK if needed, but it appears they are working on increasing transaction prices and per-unit profit than on maxing out production.If the Sonata is an inferior car because it sells \"only\" 11,000 per month in the U.S., I guess that makes low-volume cars like the Mazda6 and Legacy really bad!   Mcdonalds sells more burgers than Wendy\\'s because they are CHEAPER. Can you guess why less Fusions are sold than Accords? They\\'re not cheaper, so there must be another reason. Hint: BECAUSE THEY ARE BETTER.Sorry Elroy, but that\\'s bad logic. I\\'ve been in many industries where the inferior and more expensive product outsold the better, less expensive product. Sometimes it\\'s marketing, sometimes it\\'s past experience/reputation (which has little to do with what\\'s available now), and sometimes it\\'s just name recognition. I\\'m not arguing that the Fusion is \"better\" than the Accord, or vice versa. But higher sales numbers do not equal \"better.\" I would also suggest that you are no more of an expert of what \"better\" is than I when it comes to cars for other people. Consumers are pretty funny, if you ask me. Often times consumers go into a store without doing any research or even knowing what characteristics are important to them. Sometimes consumers focus on one characteristic without conisdering other important ones. All this is just saying that just because someone buys something, it does not necessarily mean that what they bought was the \"best\" choice for them. The process of buying a car is complicated and tiring which many people find very stressful. Under these conditions, it\\'s no wonder why someone may buy something that is not ideal. If people were completely logical and clear thinking, there would be no need for salespeople...  Backy - this is the car that was supposed to fire a shot over the bow of the CamCordTima and make em shiver in their boots. Sure that Sonata\\'s a good car, but 11,000 units?! How many units did the older design Sonata sell in a March?  it\\'s no wonder why someone may buy something that is not ideal.Its goes both ways. Some buy Ford because its the only dealer in their little town. What - defaulting to a Honda is somehow a BAD thing? Honda\\'s reputation garners many sales. That reputation didn\\'t just fall into their lap.  What - defaulting to a Honda is somehow a BAD thing? Honda\\'s reputation garners many sales. That reputation didn\\'t just fall into their lap.sorry, but did I say it was a bad thing? and where did you get in your mind that I didn\\'t like Honda or that their reputation wasn\\'t deserved? I\\'m just saying that higher sales #\\'s don\\'t equal \"better\" and that \"better\" isn\\'t so easy to define when there are many different characteristics that people value differently.  The Sonata was the car that, when introduced, bested the Camry in multiple comparos. (The Altima available at that time wasn\\'t deemed worthy to even participate in those comparos.) More than a shot over the bow of Toyota and Nissan, I\\'d say. And they have responded with better designs in the past year. And you may have noticed that since the \\'06 Sonata was introduced, huge discounts with Honda-to-dealer incentives have been available on Accords. Coincidence? Or maybe some people have figured out that an Accord isn\\'t worth $5000+ more than a Sonata, so Honda has had to adjust their market pricing to compensate.As for how many Gen 3 Sonatas were sold in prior Marches, in 2005 11,373 were sold (best ever for the Sonata up to that time) due in large part to huge close-out incentives right before the new Sonata was released; in March 2004, 8,736 were sold; in March 2003, 7550 were sold, and in March 2002 (the first year for the refreshed Gen 3 Sonata) 5725 were sold. So 11,000 is on the high end for monthly sales for the Sonata--as high as the best sales month ever for the prior generation.  And you may have noticed that since the \\'06 Sonata was introduced, huge discounts with Honda-to-dealer incentives have been available on Accords. Coincidence? Um, sorta. The Accord is now a five-year old design, and Honda typically offers some incentives just before a new design debuts.   I\\'m just saying that higher sales #\\'s don\\'t equal \"better\" I think, in this case, it does. Considering: The Accord costs more, yet sells more. I must not be the only one who thinks it\\'s better. Why are they paying more for it, if they don\\'t think it\\'s better? Are we all being fooled, or brainwashed? This is only MY opinion, and you are entitled to your own. Camry buyers can say the Camry is better, because it sells more, at a higher price, and I don\\'t have to agree with them. Opinions are like ***holes, everybody has one, and they all stink.   The 2006 Sonata was introduced to the U.S. two years ago, when the new-for-2003 Accord was mid-way through its third year. Does Honda typically offer huge discounts/incentives 2-1/2 years before a new design debuts? Not in my car-shopping experience they don\\'t--not if they don\\'t have to, anyway.  I don\\'t think Toyota and Honda are afraid of the Sonata, as many have claimed they would be. The Altima seems much more a force to be reckoned with. The \"Hyundai challenge\" is not much of a challenge.  glad we agree now...  So do you suppose then that Honda put big incentives on the Accord out of the goodness of their hearts? What cars are forcing them to do that? The Camry, which has few incentives? The Altima--ditto? The Aura--ditto? Surely they don\\'t fear the Malibu or G6--or do they...? Do you suppose it\\'s possible the big incentives on the Accord are because too many buyers are snapping up Sonatas and its cousin the Optima, so Honda had to do something to narrow the price gap?  So do you suppose then that Honda put big incentives on the Accord out of the goodness of their hearts? Perhaps because the design, while being five years old, is something people don\\'t want, because it will make their car \"the old model\" soon.  The fact that Honda has incentives on the Accord is no surprise given the fact that its five model years old. Also, they typically had incentives (not cash rebates) on the Accords towards the end of the model year, as did the previous version of the Camry, and the 2006 Sonata.Its a fact that the dated Accord continues to be at or near the top of this segment. The 2008 Accord retail prices are not expected to rise that much. perhaps less than 3%, or a few hundred dollars and standard content will increase. I would not go out any buy one right away when they are introduced because you will not likely receive a large discount. Perhaps, wait until mid to late December of 2007 to get a pretty significant discount. This segment of the market is too competitive. I bet you that many of those competitor cars have rebates/dealer incentives/special leases and finance rates on them come that time. Also, you can get a 2007 Camry CE or LE 4 in my locale for a rather signifcant savings off of MSRP. Why? Although the vehicle is selling well - its nearing the end of the model year and the market is too crowded.  So do you suppose then that Honda put big incentives on the Accord out of the goodness of their hearts? What cars are forcing them to do that? Because the 5 year \"old\" Accord is competing with a \"new\" Camry and a \"new\" Altima. The rest are inconsequential (don\\'t matter much).  I think most people don\\'t know about Hyundai. Many that do, just remember the negatives from the late \\'80\\'s. Probably over 90% of car buyers have never taken a close look at a Hyundai, never mind a test drive. I wouldn\\'t say there are being fooled or are brain washed but, perhaps, maybe foolish for not taking a close look at Hyundai (and other makes) to see what is available in the market now. Good luck with a brand helps build owner loyalty (heck, Hyundai often offers a loyalty rebate). Honda & Toyota have been building great cars for 20+/- years now. Hyundai started building great cars in \\'99 or 2000. It will take them a while to gain widespread acceptance. They are slowly attracting more attention and buyers. Counting myself, I know three Hyundai drivers who, following conventional wisdom, wouldn\\'t have looked at a Hyundai 3 years ago (actually one of them is picking up his new Azera Wednesday).  The competition has increased from the 1980\\'s when Accords used to sell at a price higher than MSRP in CT. Whether manufacturer to dealer or manufacturer to consumer, Honda has felt a need to offer incentives. And, as you said, they typically had incentives towards the end of the model year. Years ago they did not. I think rebates to the consumer are better for the consumer as he is sure to get the rebate. Incentives to the dealer are not \"always\" 100% passed along to the consumer.  If a manufacturer offers dealers a $1500 incentive but only $700 of the incentive reaches the consumer that could help the resale value, but the consumers would have been \"shorted\" $800 up front. Which would you rather have $800 today or $800 extra when you dispose of the car in a few years?  My god, the Accord is a good sedan but being the best or better than the Camry and Aura, I think not. Those beast\\'s are more buzzy than a Yellow Jacket flying around your ear. :surprise: I do believe the 08\\' Accord will be a good automobile. I however think the current Accord was passed up by the Camry, and the new Aura. I suppose if I was a buyer in this segment I\\'d go Aura. Rocky  Do you suppose it\\'s possible the big incentives on the Accord are because too many buyers are snapping up Sonatas and its cousin the Optima, so Honda had to do something to narrow the price gap?Yes - agreed. For a while there Accord sales were way off.  Agreed. Many forget to point out Hyundai has only been in the US for 20 years, while Toyota and Honda both have been around here for 50 years (Toyota 50+; Honda - just shy of 50 years). I hope many remember there was a time when both Toyota and Honda was, well, let\\'s just say, not as successful as they are today. They were in the same position as Hyundai about ten, fifteen years ago, but the difference, Hyundai is improving and changing the game at a much faster rate.  Exhaust systemsCount me in the group of Accord owners who have great luck with exhaust systems. My 95 EX I4 manual (that my son now drives) with 220k miles still has the original system, including the muffler. I\\'m sure it will go any day now.   There are pluses and minuses to either one - rebate or incentives. Rebates are taxable in CA and dealer incentives are not. Rather, rebates are used to offset the purchase price plus all add-ons, taxes, doc fees,license/registration, etc. figure, as are cash you contribute and/or trade-in. You have to be smart to get most/all of the dealer incentives - but the dedicated Prices Paid Forums really help. They are likely to pass on the entire dealer incentive amount - since there is a 3% holdback on a Honda.I remember Accords always being discounted here in CA since the late 1980s. So, I don\\'t share your experience as to paying above MSRP.  I think the Sonata is a nice looking car. I like the styling of it as much as the Accord. It looks to me like the visibility is a bit better from the inside of the Sonata, because the rear roof pillars aren\\'t as thick as they are on the Accord. Also, look at the features you get on even the base level Sonata--XM Radio (can\\'t get that on the Accord until you go to the exl), stability control (can\\'t get that unless you get the V6), etc.. I love xm radio (which I have as an aftermarket unit on my 02 Accord), and it seems like the advantages of stability control outweigh the disadvantages.And so far, the people who own the Sonata seem to like it. I\\'m just surprised that sales aren\\'t higher. Is it still the left over discrimination against cars in the late 80s and early 90s that weren\\'t that good?  They are paying more for the Accord because the media has beat it into thier heads that it is worth it when it is not.The Fusion is by far a better value, costing thousands less.A .5 second difference?? is a whole lot faster?? can you count to a 1/2 second???This room is turning into a joke. Once again the Honda fans get to bash away at the Fusion/Sonata or anyone else that differs on their opinion. I have threads taken off that are not near as bad as are posted on here! :mad:  This room is turning into a joke. Once again the Honda fans get to bash away at the Fusion/Sonata or anyone else that differs on their opinion. I have threads taken off that are not near as bad as are posted on here!Sounds like sour grapes to me. I don\\'t interpret it as bashing anything non-Honda, more like crowing cause the Accord is that good, even being a 6 year old model. Why take a chance on a Ford (weak reputation) or a Hyundai (unproven to the masses) when you can just buy an Accord and rest easy?  Let me clarify what I said earlier: these incentives and deals on the Accord didn\\'t just start appearing in the past few months, on 5-year-old Accords (design-wise). They have been around for about 2 years. Coinciding with the arrival of the \\'06 Sonata, the first truly competitive mid-sized offering from Hyundai. I don\\'t think it was a coincidence.It will be interesting to see what happens if Honda drops incentives on the 2008 Accords and dealers try to sell them at or near MSRP, especially if MSRP goes up. Then it will be back to a $5000-6000+ difference between the Sonata/Optima and the Accord, if Hyundai/Kia maintain current levels of incentives.  I suppose it won\\'t matter as the Accord, will sell like hot cakes. I wouldn\\'t be the least surprise if the Accord is the #1 car sold in America, in 2008. Rocky  Why take a chance on a Ford (weak reputation) or a Hyundai (unproven to the masses) when you can just buy an Accord and rest easy? In the case of the Sonata two reasons immediately come to mind; price and warranty. Then there\\'s the 5 year roadside service and features of each car.We just bought an \\'07 Sonata SE w/XM for $3357 LESS than Edmund\\'s TMV. What is the street price of a comparable ACCORD? We may be looking at a real price difference of $5,000 or more right now. If the comparable Honda is the LX V-6, Edmunds says the TMV is $24,282 and there is a $750 to dealer incentive. If 100% of the incentive is granted to the consumer, the TMV price would be $23,532. If I compare our actual Sonata purchase price to the TMV for the Accord, I\\'m looking at a savings of $6481 for the Sonata. Are Accords selling below TMV? If so, by how much?  I don\\'t think Sonata/Optima are likely to ever steal sales from Accord. They are much more likely to steal sales from cars with less loyal buyers (Galant, Malibu, Fusion, Sebring). To think that the 06 Sonata affected Accord incentives, is exaggeration, if not fantasy.  Just looking at your subject line......thanks for not going the personal route :sick: .  That wouldn\\'t surprise me, either. Few things do these days. However, the mid-sized market is a different than it was in the fall of 2002, when the current Accord design debuted. Back then, you had the Camry, Altima, and then-new Mazda6 as clear-cut front-runners in the class. The competition is much stiffer now, with new-for-2007 Camry and Altima still there; the Aura, Fusion, Legacy, and Milan; the Sonata and Optima; the Passat; and all-new Mazda6 and Malibu due for 2008. So if Honda tries pricing the Accord too high, there are lots of good alternatives for price-conscious buyers.  I try not to get personal. I deal with that way too much and I have many wounds to prove it. The 08\\' Accord, I think will indeed be a nice car. I like the pics I see as it finally has character. I being a former Acura TL, owner (a mistake) did like the product very much but hated the service. I however do think a SH-AWD Acura TL, would be a hit. It will need enough power to overcome the AWD problem if they aren\\'t going to make it a RWD car. I think it would be more popular as a SH-AWD car anyways but it\\'s going to have to come in with plenty of power and have the \"gadgetology\" to once again become a class leader. We will see.....This fall the best mid-size automobile even though I\\'s perfer the Holden grill is the RWD Pontiac G8. If they make a HSV version of this car like they do in Australia, their isn\\'t another non-lux car out on the market that will touch it\\'s handling and power. It\\'s basically a street legal race car in HSV trim. I however won\\'t expect to see a HSV for a year or two. Acura, right now has the best chance to meet the G8\\'s power. They better not under estimate the G8\\'s impact on their own sales. I still think Acura, would be best to Twin-Turbo their V6 to make the power. Like I said we will see as more and more sporty and luxury cars hit this segment. The new Mazda6 and Mazdaspeed 6 is coming. Of course we have the Spec. B Subie. The RWD Impala in 2009. How bout the 2010 Buick Velite Sedan ? I\\'m just saying it\\'s going to be a crowded field as more and more offerings hit the midsize segment. Rocky  backy, couldn\\'t agree with you more. I as I said in my last e-mail can\\'t believe how crowded this field will get. I guess I should of left out the 09\\' RWD Impala, as I forgot it will be considered a large car then. The malibu, will take the current Impala\\'s place. Rocky  these incentives and deals on the Accord didn\\'t just start appearing in the past few months, on 5-year-old Accords (design-wise). They have been around for about 2 years. Not according to Edmunds and other sources. There was no dealer incentive when I bought my Accord in March of 06. They started soon after, however,   Manufacturers only offer discounts for one reason, and one reason only. To sell more cars. There is a variety of reasons why they want to sell more cars, such as clearing space for new models, or reaching some sales goal ect. they don\\'t start handing out 1500 dollars to buyers just because the design is old. a $1500 rebate reduces the profit to almost nothing on a camry, altima, accord, or similar mid size sedan.the same will hold true if buying a car at the end of the year. If for example, you want an altima and they\\'re still selling 25-30% over last years numbers, good luck getting a rebate. If nissan can sell them without one, they aren\\'t going to offer one. ditto for any other car. If you want a rebate on a good selling car, you\\'ll have to wait till jan, or feb, of \\'08 when they will want all the 07 cars off the lot.  Sounds like sour grapes to me. I don\\'t interpret it as bashing anything non-Honda, more like crowing cause the Accord is that good, even being a 6 year old model. Why take a chance on a Ford (weak reputation) or a Hyundai (unproven to the masses) when you can just buy an Accord and rest easy?Considering this post blatantly breaks the guidelines established in the first post:Well, duh, it\\'s about midsize sedans. But here is what it is not about:# manufacturers issues# manufacturer vs. manufacturer...Then yes, Scape does have a valid point.  Not all of these incentives to dealers are public knowledge. Dealers can choose to pass them along to buyers or apply them to their profits. For example, if you look at Edmunds.com now for incentives on the Accord, what do you see? Awhile ago, Hyundai was offering manufacturer-to-dealer incentives on the Sonata, and these didn\\'t show up at Edmunds.com either.  1995 Dodge Stratus with 184,240 miles and the exhaust system is entirely original. It has been in Pa its entire life and has seen its share of road salt. It is a stainless steel system which is a great thing. Pa has an annual vehicle inspection and the exhaust is one of the things looked at so I can\\'t avoid repair if it is found to be leaking.  If you or scape2 or anyone else believes a post to be inappropriate, please email me your concerns. Since I host many discussions, please give me the name of the discussion along with the post numbers. And please give me your user name since I can\\'t tell that from your email address.You can always get my email address from my profile at the top of any discussion I host, but it\\'s not too hard: pat AT edmunds.com Thanks - I appreciate the assist, always!!   Backy - Where did you get your information about incentives on Accords appearing 2 years ago?I purchased my Accord in April 2006 and there were NO incentives at that time. To my knowledge, incentives on the Accord were only made available within the last 6 months or so.  $750 Incentives were put in place for a few months at the end of the Accord\\'s 2006 model year, IIRC.  Since this discussion frequently strays into a \"Honda equals a no-brainer choice that even an automotive dim-wit can buy without regret or fear\" sort of mindset I\\'ll give an opposing opinion. We bought our first ever Honda product, a 2006 Civic EX sedan automatic, in Nov 2005. It has had both rear shocks replaced at about 4K miles but the rear suspension noise that resulted from leaking shocks started on the drive home from the dealer @ 6 miles showing. It has had two (of about a dozen potential bulletins for the 06 Civic alone) service bulletins applied, both for abnormal noises. The second required replacement of the right upper motor mount. The interior plastics used are of terrible quality, particularly on the door trim where the door pull/arm rest is. It is a \"waffle\" pattern that scratches easily and irrevocably. The pattern in the cloth on the driver seat bolster has begun to disappear (as in wear off)and the fabric itself is bunching up on that same bolster. The car has excessive wind/road noise. On the other hand fuel economy is fairly good on the road and we have not had any driving issues except for the interior noise and the 5 speed auto that shifts out of 5th into 4th at the very thought of an incline not to mention a hill. I am not entirely happy with Honda and yes,I was one of those who went into this with that Honda = quality mindset. How did I get that? print media (all those golden articles in all those car and consumer magazines) and word of mouth (ask ANY Honda owner it never breaks). The car currently has 7,358 miles not a typo 7 thousand miles. I previously owned (and several in our family still own)Hyundai products which by comparison were and are trouble free at 10 to 20X the mileage of the Honda. I am a lone voice in the wilderness....  They are paying more for the Accord because the media has beat it into thier heads that it is worth it when it is not. The Fusion is by far a better value, costing thousands less. A .5 second difference?? is a whole lot faster?? can you count to a 1/2 second??? This room is turning into a joke. Once again the Honda fans get to bash away at the Fusion/Sonata or anyone else that differs on their opinion. I have threads taken off that are not near as bad as are posted on here! -Scape, I\\'ll further support my case by asking you to look more closely at the performance numbers. In the Car & Driver article I referenced \"The Quickest Cars of 2007: Less than $20,000,\" they clock the Accord 0-60 in 7.5 seconds. In the same article, the Mazda3 s, being smaller/lighter than the Fusion but having the saving engine, beats the Accord to 60 by 0.2 seconds.However, look at the \"street start\" 5-60 mph numbers. In my opinion, this is a good measure of an engines\\' usable torque and makes a big difference in throttle response around town or in traffic. The Mazda3 s, although faster than the Accord 0-60, is SLOWER than the Accord from 5-60 by 0.8 seconds! (Accord 7.9 versus Mazda3 8.7 5-60 mph).The 5-60 time of the Accord is only 0.1 second off from the faster, more powerful, 6-speed manual Altima! I think that\\'s noteworthy.According to C&D, the Fusions \"street start\" time is 9.0 seconds, or over a second slower than the Accord. That is a difference you can really feel when driving both cars. AGAIN, does that mean I am \"bashing away\" at the Fusion? No! Most people don\\'t care too much how quick their car will respond to throttle inputs. I\\'m just here to talk and compare midsize sedans. Can we do that? You are right, the Fusion is a great value, of course the resale value is less so it roughly evens out.  because the media has beat it into thier heads that it is worth it when it is not. The Fusion is by far a better value, costing thousands less. The media has somehow determined what an Accord is worth??!! Give me a break and the American autobuyer a little credit! Economics 101- it is the buyers that determine the worth of anything not scape2 and certainly not captain2. In this case it is several hundred thousand of buyers that determine what the Camcord and the Fusion is worth both now and later. Economics 102 - \\'value\\' can have little to do with initial price.  Since this discussion frequently strays into a \"Honda equals a no-brainer choice that even an automotive dim-wit can buy without regret or fear\" sort of mindset I\\'ll give an opposing opinionNo, your not the only one who feels that way. I know a civic is not an accord, but i was so unimpressed with my civic i never even seriously considered the accord when i made my last purchase. I pretty much was picking between the camry and altima. And to be fair, the civic runs great (although I do have to fork out the $$$ for the timing belt change that I never have to with chained nissans) but the interior is just so cheap, and poorly constructed that I wasn\\'t even going to take a chance with the accord. I still can\\'t believe the mid level trim came with a tape player instead of cd. But the problems you described are spot on. the damn texture to the plastics, inaddition to the scratching problem) are a pain in the [non-permissible content removed] to keep clean. and the cloth on the door pannel fell off durring year two. just a cheap glue holding it on.And as I said, I know the accord is of much higher quality than both the civic and competition in its class. The catch, though, is the price. Out of all the midsize sedans out there, the accord is always the most expensive......and usally several thousand more. Sure, they\\'re rebating the hell out of \\'em now, and sales are way up. But, I\\'d be willing to bet when the 08\\'s show up, the price rises, and the rebates dissapear; you won\\'t get one off the lot for less than 23-24k. For any who doubt, look at the civic. redisgned in 06, much better, nicer car, and much more expensive. At my local honda dealer, the base models are starting at about 18,300. as a result, its the most expensive compact in market, and sales (so far this year) are down about 15%  It is a circular argument. The media ALWAYS says that Honda is golden in all manner of ways and the American auto shopper sees, reads, believes and buys the NEW Honda (much like I did) thus keeping resale up because the media says Honda is golden and the perspective USED car buyer also sees, reads, believes, and wants..you guessed it..a used Honda. How do you think this determined \"worth\" comes about? It starts with good press. If you think the media (consumer and auto test magazines stating Honda is GOOD)don\\'t have any effect on the \"worth\" of a used Accord/Civic etc. or conversely any relatively negative comments about a Ford product have a \"less than positive\" effect on the resale of that Ford product you are incorrect. It is a game of perception initiated by the media. The car itself may..or may not...be so golden in the end but perception is king...  and using the Honda as a reference - there are VALID statistical studies that the new (or used) Honda is likely to be a less troublesome car than any Ford ever thought of being. Reference: the CR 07 Auto issue. BTW if and when Honda makes a car that does not live up to expectations, that \\'perception\\' honeymoon you are talking about will become a 20 year marriage, prices will go down, as will scape\\'s \\'value\\'.I believe, that in general, the Fusion is viewed pretty favorably, perhaps the \\'best\\' Ford product out there, which is definitely a relative consideration. Again, IMPO, I might look at it seriously once they can improve their engines and stop supporting the Mexican economy. Until then, it\\'ll likely be the new Altima 3.5/CVT or possibly the new (09?)Accord (if it is as \\'developed\\' as I think it will be) in my driveway.  In terms of Honda, let\\'s try to stick to the Accord here. The Civic isn\\'t in this class and Honda as a manufacturer is not the subject. Thanks.  According to C&D, the Fusions \"street start\" time is 9.0 seconds, or over a second slower than the Accord. That is a difference you can really feel when driving both cars.This 9.0 sec time from 5-60 for 4 cyl manual transmission Fusion lacks credibility, since CR got 9.5 sec for 0-60 in a 4 cyl automatic (march 2006). And they do their test by just stomping on the gas pedal.  there are VALID statistical studies that the new (or used) Honda is likely to be a less troublesome car than any Ford ever thought of being. Reference: the CR 07 Auto issue. To return this to the midsize sedan topic, what valid statistical conclusion have you come to based on comparing the Fusion to the Accord in the magazine you reference? (I have not seen the issue.)  (although I do have to fork out the $$$ for the timing belt change that I never have to with chained nissans) And since we ARE talking about Accords here and not Civics, readers would want to know that the I4 Accords have timing chains, not belts. :shades:  wish I knew how to post the chart - a line graph showing problems/100 vehicles on the y axis and vehicle age (up to 10 years) on the x axis. So, therefore, an ascending graph as the vehicle ages - Toyota/Honda/Nissan showing about half the number of problems thru the years than the \\'US\\' mfgrs- apparently based on several hundred thousand responses to their questionnaires over the years. The Fusion, incidentally, has been doing pretty well, but hasn\\'t been around long enough to be able to tell if it will continue to show good results over the long term or will become more like the \\'usual\\' Ford. Same sort of situation right now for Hyundai and the new Sonata BTW, because history does not support that mfgr. making cars to the same sort of levels that the \\'Japan 3\\' has. 5 years from now, who knows, we may find out that the 05 Fusion is exactly what scape says it is - it may be the first \\'bulletproof\\' Ford ever made.  \"Manufacturers only offer discounts for one reason, and one reason only. To sell more cars. \"I see Honda is now offering low interest rates? Why? if their cars are selling so well? :confuse:  The fifth year of one car is the fifth year of another. People become more insecure when a car is only months away from making theirs the old, obsolete model. Toyota did the same thing, Nissan did the same thing, and Ford doesn\\'t dare ask sticker for many of its models, last I looked, including the Fusion (that had at least a thousand in rebate cash).  The media plays a huge role in perception as to what a car is worth to the consumer. If we are told over and over and over again that an Accord/Camry is the \"best\" then yes people will fork out more $$ for it. It is going to take the consumer some time to realize Honda or Toyota do make good cars. But they are not worth the extra premium price. However, lets look again at the Car and Driver comparison of the 3 vehicles. What some here fail to see is this is a comparison done by consumers, not one person like a review by a magazine that needs to keep its sales up. The mag is going to take the easy route with the sedan that is selling the most vehicles. These test hosted by Car and Driver and yes, paid by Ford were everyday people like you and I. Unlike a bias review from one \"expert\" that must keep the masses happy to keep sales of the magazine up. This comparison test is very significant.For me, the Fusion was by far the better value, better car than a like optioned Camry or Accord. It handles like its on rails. As far as road noise it matches the Accord/Camry in Db levels. Granted, you romp on the gas and it does get a little noisier than an Accord or Camry.  I point to the actual reviews from consumers above that actually own these vehicles. Experts are a dime a dozen. The consumer is master. Fusion 9.2, Accord 9.1, Camry 8.7??.I don\\'t see how you can discount actual consumers who buy and own these vehicles. And, the Accord/Camry has 3x as many reviews as the Fusion!!    For me, the Accord was the much better value. The 4-cylinder engine is far peppier-feeling than the Fusion\\'s was, especially at low-mid revs, where the Fusion came up weak-kneed. Couple better power with higher fuel economy, and the powertrain sold me on the Accord. The Fusion being noisier with a 90s-blocky interior put it on the backburner for me as well. The Fusion handled nicely, but not enough to overcome the bumpier ride for my butt that it provided. Different strokes...  Wow. 38 reviews. 1 tenth of a point. I\\'m sold.To paraphrase something I\\'ve heard... \"can you really count 1 tenth?\"  So the short answer to \"what valid statistical conclusion have you come to based on comparing the Fusion to the Accord in the magazine you reference?\" is... None.Here are some numbers for 4 cylinder automatics...edmunds expected total maintenance and repair costs for 5 years/75,000 miles:Fusion SE = $4229Accord SE = $4098Camry SE = $5233Altima S = $3039Looks to me like Camry is the one to worry about, not the Fusion. Why does it cost so much more to maintain a Camry? And so much less for the Altima?  As I just mentioned a couple of hours ago, we need to stick to the vehicles themselves. Some posts have been removed.  This 9.0 sec time from 5-60 for 4 cyl manual transmission Fusion lacks credibility, since CR got 9.5 sec for 0-60 in a 4 cyl automatic (march 2006). And they do their test by just stomping on the gas pedal. Huh? I was citing times from C&D... Car and Driver. They are very accurate, and I doubt CR just \"stomps on the gas.\" Remember, \"street start\" or 5-60 times are almost always slower than 0-60 times for the exact same car. This is because they are conducted from a rolling start which uses 2nd gear. It is desinged to measure the torque or low end (low RPM) power an engine has, kind of like the 50-70 mph tests conducted in a vehicles top gear.  targettuning, please check your email.  OK then our 1995 dodge Stratus at 185,000 miles has great perceived quality. The engine is quiet, uses no oil,starts instantly in all weather. The interior is not worn at all, the plastic pieces aren\\'t scratched up. All controls click satisfyingly. It drives great..only one problem Chrysler makes lousy cars. But in reality they don\\'t??  \"These test hosted by Car and Driver and yes, paid by Ford were everyday people like you and I. Unlike a bias review from one \"expert\" that must keep the masses happy to keep sales of the magazine up. This comparison test is very significant.\"The \\'comparison test\\' was a Ford advertisment as clearly specified. It was a paid advertisment, pure and simple. I wonder if you had felt its significance if the Accord had won it.  \"The consumer is master.\"Exactly. That\\'s why Accords sell more than Fusions.  Honda has been offering incentives and low APRs to sell more cars, expecially with the redesign coming up. So what\\'s the question?  \"It is going to take the consumer some time to realize Honda or Toyota do make good cars. But they are not worth the extra premium price\"Opinion, not fact, as stated by your post.  Huh? I was citing times from C&D... Car and Driver. I was aware of that. Point was the two sets of numbers did not make sense to me. But, I was not aware that the test you refer to is based on being in second gear at 5 mph.Seems like that 5-60 test result could also depend on the 2nd gear ratio. The car with the lower ratio in second would have an advantage, provided a shift to 3rd is not required.95% of people are buying automatics anyway, so all the tests of manual transmission equipped vehicles should not impact their decision.  I have followed Town Hall closely for over 7 years, and keep up with the \"prices paid\" discussions. I recall discussions of big discounts/incentives under invoice on Accords going back a couple of years. Here is an example from May 2005, mentioning a $900 \"bonus\" (a rebate by any other name would smell as sweet...):willie8, \"Honda Accord: Prices Paid & Buying Experience\" #7911, 29 May 2005 5:51 amIf you look at the prices from that time, you\\'ll see many way under invoice. I doubt Honda dealers would do that unless they had some incentives/rebates from the manufacturer. Unfortunately, not all Honda dealers choose to pass these incentives along to customers--which apparently happened in your case.  I thought 5-60 \"street start\" acceleration was just to reduce the effects of a controlled launch. It is simply \"standing on the gas\" from a rolling start. I don\\'t know about this \"second gear\" business, it may well be true, but it\\'s not the impression I was under from years of C&D subscriptions.  Looks to me like Camry is the one to worry about, not the Fusion. Why does it cost so much more to maintain a Camry? And so much less for the Altima? Honestly, I wouldn\\'t pay any attention to those at all. The reason the camry is so high is because they are probably the most honest. the reverse would be true for nissan. The cost of ownership is one of them most minupulated figures out there. To get a lower number, the manufacturer will simply push back the maintanence intervals. for instance, how many people have bought cars where the owners manual says to change the oil every 7500 miles? and to cover their butts, they add that line that if you drive under more severe conditions (never defined though) that you should bump up time/milage intervals.  and to cover their butts, they add that line that if you drive under more severe conditions (never defined though) that you should bump up time/milage intervals. Actually, my owner\\'s manual states the criteria for \"severe conditions.\" They include extreme temperatures (and actually state the numbers they count as extreme, I just don\\'t have the manual in front of me!), dusty conditions, etc...I have an Accord, by the way.  To get a lower number, the manufacturer will simply push back the maintanence intervalshuh?- scheduled maintanence is a miniscule portion of the cost of owing any car. The important numbers would be what it costs to buy vs. what is worth when you are done with it. Fuel and insurance costs won\\'t make a really large difference either.  had the Accord won it - then Ford didn\\'t do a very good job \\'selling\\' and \\'paying\\' - did they/  Looks to me like Camry is the one to worry about, not the Fusion. Why does it cost so much more to maintain a Camry? And so much less for the Altima?That $1000 difference is purely the transmision if it goes south. Toyota\\'s fancy mega-speed computer controlled transmissions are hellishly expensive to repair. Of course, the costs for the manual version(s)... Whole other story.The Accord VP with stick was by far the best of the bduget sedans that I test drove. This car was built in Japan(one of only 2 or 3 specific Honda Civic/Accord models) with the same gearbox and engine that they use over there. And it was lovely.The same thing happens if you get a Mercedes with manual and the smaller engine. This is the exact combo they offer in Germany and it\\'s a joy to drive. The big engine slushomatik is crap they churn out for rental companies and it shows.  http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/pricing/best-worst-in-car-reliability-10- 05/how-they-age/0704_how-they-age.htmthis would be that \\'None\\'  Sorry, don\\'t see anything there that leads to a valid statistical conclusion with regard to the Fusion or the Accord...which is what I had asked you about.  backy - I purchased my Accord about 1 year ago for $800 under invoice (trunk tray, wheel locks included). At the time, that was a good price for the car.Now that the $750 mfg. to dealer incentive is in effect, it is common to see deals of $1500 (or more) under invoice posted in the Priced Paid forum.Since you follow the forum closely, I\\'m sure you would agree that the prices paid (relative to invoice) have definitely gone down since this $750 incentive went into effect (by $500-$1000 over the last year or so, according to recent posts).  I don\\'t know that I do. If you look at the prices posted about 2 years ago, there are some great deals there. But it\\'s very possible that incentives have increased recently as the current Accord nears the end of its life. That doesn\\'t change the fact that there were significant incentives in place 2 years ago. And IMO the price competition from cars like the Sonata and now the Optima are the main reason why Honda has to offer big incentives to move cars that the automotive press routinely proclaims as \"best in class.\"  I think the PP & BE board has been a really terrific addition to our Forums. I guess it\\'s been up and running for a number of years now and I know it\\'s been a great help to many, many members - myself included.But I do think it\\'s important for those of us who rely on the exact numbers being posted to be aware that you can\\'t always know the total deal. Something I wish folks would question more closely when people post what look like great deals is the trade-in details, i.e., was there a trade-in, what vehicle was it, in what (fairly assessed) condition and what allowance did you get for it?The reason I say that is because it\\'s not the least bit unusual for a dealership to undervalue the trade-in for the specific purpose of lowering the stated purchase price.Another thing to wonder about is the total amount of \"document fees\" - some dealerships will ink a deal that looks great when you\\'re looking at what they say they are selling you the car for, but then when you go to drive away, you find that there are additional fees up one side and down the other.I don\\'t want to turn this into a debate over the posts on that board, but I do want to caution that there may be more than meets the eye to some of these deals that seem so deeply discounted - no MATTER what car we\\'re talking about. I guess I\\'m suggesting a \"trust, but verify\" approach.  Which is a pretty good idea in most areas of life! :P  Note that Edmunds says those maintenance costs include both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. I doubt the number of oil changes is going account for a difference of this magnitude over 5 years. Unless Camry requires an oil change every month or something. I don\\'t buy the unsupported speculation that Toyota is more \"honest\". Warranty Direct, in their defintion of terms, happens to mention that: Toyota, for example, has a high average cost of repair but quite a good index rating - which means that the car fails infrequently but when it does you will be in for a larger than average bill. This is from UK data, but perhaps this explains some of the high Camry costs?  then either you didn\\'t understand what I said in #334 or maybe just didn\\'t want to believe it?AGAIN\"and using the Honda as a reference - there are VALID statistical studies that the new (or used) Honda is likely to be a less troublesome car than any Ford ever thought of being. Reference: the CR 07 Auto issue\"and later\"the Fusion is viewed pretty favorably, perhaps the \\'best\\' Ford product out there, which is definitely a relative consideration.\" I guess these statistics, which tell us that an 8 yr old Honda will report an average of 55 problems/100 vehicles as opposed to 110 for a Ford, mean nothing? Magically I guess the American consumer is supposed to line up to buy a Fusion based on 18 months of some decent reliability conveniently ignoring past histories, when the Accord has been that way for 20 years or so? Or maybe we should really believe those ridiculous TV commercials?to quote the article and survey:\"American manufacturers still have not closed the gap between them and the Asians. Ford has been, and continues to be the most reliable among the domestic manufacturers for older vehicles\"  backy - don\\'t bite on this one - really doubt that Honda gives a damn about what Sonatas or Optimas sell for. Camrys or Altimas, perhaps.  Those interested in how TCO scores are figured should read About True Cost to Own to see what the deal is.  There are problems with looking at things simply in terms of the number of generic \"problems per 100 vehicles\". Just one is that the assumption that 55 vs. 110 really means much of any significance.There are other problems with CR red circle data and their data collection methods. There are problems with assuming that because manufacturer X has a better stat than mfr Y, this means every model from X is better than every model from mfr Y.  There are problems with assuming that because manufacturer X has a better stat than mfr Y, this means every model from X is better than every model from mfr Y.Exactly. And that is one important reason that in this particular discussion on the Sedans board we\\'re going to talk about the actual midsize sedans instead of the manufacturers.I appreciate everyone\\'s cooperation on this. If you are going to post here, please make it about one (or more) of the vehicles listed at the top or about any other vehicle(s) in this class.  They are paying more for the Accord because the media has beat it into thier heads that it is worth it when it is not. Wow scape2, how many times have you said this? (100 or more). Talk about beating something into people\\'s heads. When I bought my first Accord in 91, I had no subscription to any car magazine, and had not read any. I rode to work in a friend\\'s 81 Accord (130 miles round trip). The car had little power, but I could tell the car had very solid construction, and I was very surprised by how well the suspension worked, for such a light car. He was always telling me how great the car was. I decided to try the 92 Accord. I drove that car for 12 years, and 140k miles. I learned in that time why so many people have \"I love my Honda\" stickers and lisence plate frames on their cars. When I decided to buy a new car, it was going to be an Accord, and the \"MEDIA\" had absolutely nothing to do with it. The ACCORD, had everything to do with it. The \"media\" did not make the Accord a great car. Honda did.  to not make this personal, please. You don\\'t have to try to beat your perspective into someone else\\'s head - it ain\\'t a-gonna work anyway, as all of you veterans of the original discussion have surely learned by now. :P Let\\'s just try to keep our comments on the vehicles themselves and acknowledge - or least allow for - the fact that others may happen to have differing views to which they are as entitled as we are to ours. That is actually a good thing, because it is what contributes to the overwhelming number of choices we have in this class.   And there are those of us who know how to sift out the posts with unclear pricing info and focus on those that are clear about the details: MSRP, discounts, rebates, fees, any trade-in etc.  Well, I didn\\'t say there weren\\'t. My only intention was to point out some pitfalls that can be encountered without digging into some of the posts there. Perhaps anyone making a post referencing some particular deal could tell us those things - or provide direct links so we can see for ourselves (the one link I see that you have provided recently here says nothing one way or another about a trade-in) - because without those details, the whole picture is hard to bring into focus. That was my only point.This is not about you, by any means. I was just making some general observations about things that some people get tangled up in. If you took it personally, I apologize.  What this forum needs is some sarcasm :P What I am reading here is that people think there is some sort of conspiracy behind the public perception that Accord and Camry are of the highest quality... as if Accords and Camrys really aren\\'t made better and worth more than the average car? That people just think that way because that is what \"the media\" tells them?Why does \"the media\" portray them as being of the highest quality? What motive would \"the media\" have to do so if they didn\\'t think it was true? What reasons could they have had to ever start praising them after they were introduced and further improved through the years?Is it a conspiracy? Or could it be that all of the independent media outlets, and the buying public, have mostly arrived at the same conclusions for a reason? Where did the \"perception\" begin, and why?Could it have been the journalists? Did the majority of independent media outlets all come together and agree to get their stories straight, to falsely represent Honda and Toyota? Why? For what purpose?Could it be Honda and Toyota? Do they convince the public that their cars are better soley through advertising, marketing, PR, etc? Doubtful, every manufacturer tries to do that.The public themselves? For years, Honda and Toyota drivers have habitually lied to their friends, family and co-workers, and on surveys such as JD Power, about how great their cars are? And drivers of other makes have been lying as well, making up stories of how mediocre or bad their cars are? Or is it just that Honda and Toyota have had a better record for many years?Regardless, the perception isn\\'t going away anytime soon. I think Accord and Camry earned it. They now have some tough competition, and while that says alot for the competitors it doesn\\'t take anything away from Accord or Camry. Plus, I don\\'t buy any of these \"initial quality\" reports. That is the thing about long-term reliability and future resale values... only time will tell if they\\'ve lost their edge.  Here is an example from May 2005I believe that this is the point people were trying to make. The date on the example you provide is from May 05, which puts it into the end of model year category. The Accord has received incentives during those times but not earlier in the model year... at least in general.  I used that date because I was replying to a question about pricing from two years ago. I didn\\'t realize May is considered \"end of model year\", but maybe that is how Honda considers it. I always thought of \"end of model year\" being in the fall, through the end of the year.So I guess those who want a deal on an Accord had better move fast... since Honda apparently doesn\\'t care about what Sonatas, Optimas etc. are priced at, only Camrys and Altimas, and those have few incentives now, when the new Accords arrive the incentives will go \"poof!\".  Please, Please read this whole comparison. The event was paid for by Ford but Hosted by Car and Driver a non bias mediator. I can completly understand if Ford had paid these people or they were all Ford employees. The Accord did not win, the Fusion did. The Fusion was chosen by the consumer not an \"expert\". This goes to show ya! Don\\'t always believe what you read...   The data also doesn\\'t tell you that the vehicle with half the problems may cost four times as much to repair. That\\'s been my experience with some of these vehicles that are statistically more reliable.Regards:OldCEM  \"had the Accord won it - then Ford didn\\'t do a very good job \\'selling\\' and \\'paying\\' - did they/ \"Statements like these mean nothing.. Ford didn\\'t pay anyone. Face it, the Accord is over priced and overrated when compared to a Fusion. Read this comparison, watch the video. I know I am driving a very well manufactured and quality vehicle. After 13,500 miles I have no squeaks, no rattles, no problems. I know 13,500 miles is nothing. But all my past Fords have also been reliable and well built. The Fusion is as solid as the day I bought it. Heck, my average mileage keeps going up! I am now at 23.9 for my average MPG!   You honestly feel the media has nothing to do with how the consumer views a manufacturer or a vehicle??  Well lets see why the media would not want to tick off the owners of the number 1 and 2 seller. Ever heard of sales, money?? The media does not want to upset the masses. Sales of there mags would go down, hate mail would fly! Time, in time as consumers do buy Fusions/Milans, Optima/Sonata whichever these folks will see that paying the extra $3,000 - 5,000 for a like optioned Camry/Accord was not worth it. This is why the comparison test that Ford hosted and Car and Driver put on is so important. These are actual consumers that chose the Fusion, not the media.. get it now? :shades:  Ford didn\\'t pay anyone. You are contradicting what you said just two posts ago, when you said Ford paid for the entire event. Ford paid for the whole \"SETUP\" including the people running the comparison. If that\\'s not bias, what is?  What I said was, the \"media\" had absolutely nothing to do with ME buying an Accord (or the second one, 12 years later). Sure, the \"media\" had me convinced that my Accord was so good for 12 years, that I bought a second. Yea, right.  If the media doesn\\'t want to tick off the owners of the number 1 and 2 sellers--which are the Camry and Accord in this class--why does C/D consistently rank the Camry at or near the bottom of the pack in its comparos? Shoot, they put even the \"lowly\" Optima ahead of the Camry in their most recent comparo of mid-sized cars. I can see that hate mail flying now!   I too loved the 1977 Accord I owned. She went about 170K before blowing her engine. I then bought a brand new 1991 Accord - expecting the same kind of reliability. I swapped it for a Dodge at 20K miles because it was constantly in the shop, and, was a bottomless money pit.Regards:OldCEM  Everything I\\'ve read about that \"test\" has made me very skeptical. Ford paying, the way the questions were asked, the fact that the Fusion was AWD and the Camry and Accord were FWD, etc. I would say the same thing about an ad that Honda or Toyota paid for if their car won.I agree that the ads (and it IS an advertisement) worked and bully for Ford. I\\'m all for more competition in this segment as the differences narrow... it only helps the consumer.Personally, any kind of advertising doesn\\'t hold a candle to my own experiences with a vehicle. And to be perfectly clear, if Accords and Camrys were perfect, there would hardly be any Fusions, Sonatas, etc. sold at all. :shades:  There were a lot of things that led up to a \\'93 Accord purchase. In the 90s, before Honda peaked, they made tight, fun to drive cars. I liked the visibility, I liked the low hood line, and the manual transmission was the cream of the crop of FWD in the early 90s (although the clutch sucked from day 1). The media acentuated all of these items. The reliablity of the car has been fine, although not as stellar as others experience. It was basically easy to work on (with the exception of front brakes), and returned good fuel economy. The current Accord I just find totally unexciting. As I reflect on it, as a strategy, it makes a lot of sense. Build a car that 20/30 somethings want...redesign it a few years later for what 40 somethings want...redesign it a few years later for what 50 somethings want, etc.My issue is that I am not in the demographic for it anymore; I must be too young. I don\\'t see myself replacing the Accord with another Accord. Its okay I don\\'t see them hurting for buyers.   I then bought a brand new 1991 Accord - expecting the same kind of reliability. I swapped it for a Dodge at 20K miles because it was constantly in the shop, and, was a bottomless money pit.That\\'s strange, because my 92 Accord (basicly the same car, minus the automatic seatbelts and sport shift switch) was never in the shop. If I would have had problems with it, I certainly wouldn\\'t have bought another one in 03.with the exception of front brakesI am in no way a machanic, and I changed the brake pads myself (once), with the help of the service manual. No problem.  The current Accord I just find totally unexciting. As I reflect on it, as a strategy, it makes a lot of sense. Build a car that 20/30 somethings want...redesign it a few years later for what 40 somethings want...redesign it a few years later for what 50 somethings want, etc. My issue is that I am not in the demographic for it anymore; I must be too young. I don\\'t see myself replacing the Accord with another Accord. Its okay I don\\'t see them hurting for buyers. As a soon-to-be 20-something, I\\'m not offended by your post, but I do respectfully disagree with you. I have a 1996 LX Accord, and a 2006 EX Accord (one was a hand-me-down that I learned to drive in, one was in return for a scholarship I earned from the parents). I think that the driving dynamics in the Accord aren\\'t that much different than they used to be, except my new car has much better grip/roadholding. My new Accord also has an advanced engine (i-VTEC) with zingy top-end power and a great exhaust note. The interior is also beautifully designed (controls seem to have design flair on top of just having ergonomic excellence). My old car (1996) has a very VERY bland interior, a basic SOHC engine, a back seat that makes six-footers cringe, and a design that is classy if not necessarily sporty.I don\\'t necessarily think Honda is a whole-lot different, but I think it has changed for the better in the places where it is (back seat, interior design, engine technology/economy/power).  I am in no way a mechanic, and I changed the brake pads myself (once), with the help of the service manual. No problem. Its cool you were wrenching on your ride. Changing disc pads is a good start, its usually pulling the wheels and then 1 or 2 bolts to get the pads out of the calipers.The issue comes with pulling the rotors to be turned, or replacing the rotors. The rotor is effectively pressed onto the hub, requiring a considerable amount of disassembly to replace.My guess is you didn\\'t replace or turn the rotors as specified in the manual (its not a super big deal, I have done that in the past as well with other vehicles- it just leads to accelerated pad wear and increases the likelihood of chatter, squeal, and uneven braking)  As a soon-to-be 20-something, I\\'m not offended by your post, but I do respectfully disagree with you. Sorry, you are right, I should\\'ve phrased that better, that wasn\\'t my point or my intent. I was more talking about a target demographic and while I\\'m glad you like your Accord, I am pretty sure you are not the target demographic.Toyota did it too. Their cars got so old they had to invent Scion to get kids to look at thier cars. Mercedes is in a similar situation and BMW has ads making fun of them for it.  OK, even if the \"Fusion Challenge\" didn\\'t have all of the cards stacked in the Fusions favor by the track layout or the wording of the survey questions, etc... People weren\\'t actually buying Fusions there, were they?There is a big difference between a consumer (who may or may not be an actual buyer or even in the market in the first place) SAYING on a survey that they prefer one vehicle over another, and actually going out and having to choose one to PURCHASE.It sounds to me like the Fusion Challenge mainly focused on styling and handling (\"See how much better the AWD Fusion drives around this autocross track than its FWD competitors!\"). Did the survey include questions about which cars the consumers thought had the best quality/long-term reliability, or which cars would retain the most value? If handling had been the most important factor in my decision to purchase, and other factors such as reliability record, resale value, and drivetrain were not important to me at all, then I would probably have agreed with the Fusion Challenge.AGAIN to each his own! That test proves nothing about the Fusion being better overall than Accord. It just proves that, to some consumers, it excels in a couple of different areas.  > Accord I owned. She went about 170K before blowing her engine.The motor blew at only 170K miles? Wow. I\\'d have been disappointed.  It must of been a operator error as those baby\\'s are set up to run till the end of time. :blush: Well that\\'s what I hear anyways from owners and fans Rocky  I lean toward the Hyundai Sonata as my next sedan but this constant Fusion Accord Camry debate makes me want to drive the Fusion and see exactly why some seem to think it is not worthy. I may even go out of my way to rent one next time a rental is necessary. In that respect the Fusion Challenge seems to have prompted a response from me...is that the media doing something to get me, at least superficially, interested in the Fusion?? Nah, the media has no influence with consumers right?.  I\\'ve enjoyed the banter between several of you on the Accord, Fusion, Camry. I had a 2007 Camry and it was the V-6 XLE. The 4 cylinder is a toally different car, and much less expensive. The Camry V-6 is a rcoket compared to anything in the other models. It also has a beautiful, Lexus like interior. Perhaps best of all it takes regular fuel and gets strong mileage numbers. My only problem with it was it didn\\'t handle well, and I felt like a fuddy duddy in it. So on to the Nissan Altima and another V-6 with 270 h.p. with the SE package and far superior handling. Consumers Reports ranks it right there with the Honda and Volkswagon Passat for top honors. The 4 cylinder is very quick and also gets a strong write-up. Funny the Fusion finishes well down the list and once again Ford puts no ponies and mediocre mileage in an inferior engine. It does handle very well. I\\'d tell anyone to look at either the 4 or 6 in an Altima and you\\'ll get great exceleration, good mileage, great handling, push button start and a transmission in CVT form that is extraodinary. Just weighing in on behalf of the Nissan fans.  We get Fusion 4 cyl rentals to go from LAX up the coast to my folks place pretty regularly. I have always found them to be pretty thrifty on fuel and they seem to feel bigger on the inside then they look on the outside (which is kind of the opposite of my old Contour). It\\'s easy to drive and has good visibility. The next trip home we will have a lot more baggage with us so we will see how the trunk does then, so far it hasn\\'t been an issue.I am really leaning towards the Mazda6 right now. I made the mistake of driving a Speed6 last night, which I think is the most fun I\\'ve had in quite some time. I can\\'t swing a new one, but it looks like Mazda 6s GTs are a pretty good deal used and reasonably easy to find in a manual transmission.  \\'selling\\' and \\'paying\\' takes a number of forms - think OJ Simpson. A lousy 23.9 mpg in a Fusion? my wife\\'s V6 Altima has been running at 26 for 4 years now - my Avalon 27. Tell me you drive the streets of Manhattan, then maybe that 23.9 is something to crow about.BTW if you really want to know what Car and Driver thinks:http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/11106/2006-toyota-camry-xle-v-6.htmlA comparison test, not under Ford\\'s influence, won by the Accord, of course - in which your Fusion actually did pretty well. If only they could have had that 3.5 under the hood, then, the car might really \\'win\\' something.  You really should grab a Fusion or Milan rental and check it out. Hertz for one has a lot of them. I thought the base Fusion (stick, no options) I drove was a very nice car even in stripped form, with a great blend of ride and handling. The stick was pretty good too. Now that the IIHS crash test scores are improved, I think the Fusion and Milan are solid offerings in this class. I haven\\'t quite warmed up to the Gillette grille on the Fusion, so I prefer the Milan styling-wise (also because the Milan comes very well equipped even in base form, with ABS standard).  hooray for nissan!!i don\\'t have any of the cars in question, but everyone has different priorities when choosing a car. some are super brand loyal, some like power, some like handling, some like style. there is no wrong answer to what car you pick or like. i\\'ve enjoyed reading a lot of this (though i would like to see the altima mentioned more often! it too gets lost in the shuffle unfortunately). all i can say is there is a reason why the camry and accord are the two highest selling cars in this segment. i think that is the true sign of consumer opinion on what they think is the \"best\" car...i\\'d still pick the altima though over all of the other cars in this segment. i like power, i like style, and i like handling...and i like to row my own gears...anyways, my two cents...-thene   it sounds to me like the Fusion Challenge mainly focussed on styling and handling---Did the survey include questions about which cars the concumers thought had the best quality/long -term reliability, or which cars would retain the most value?Isn`t there something to be learned from this statement ? When any of the actual current CARS are compared (styling; build quality; handling; ride quality; comfort and convenience features;safety features;acceleration;fuel economy etc.) the Accord lovers on this forum have a very hard time defending their \\'best in class\\' arguements. So they inevitably abandon discussion of current CARS and instead revert to discussion of how the market place rated reliability and /or resale in previous years ( where the Accord does have an excellent track record).It`s hard for any competitor to come to the table with out giving it time to devlop it`s own record ! Don`t get me wrong, these are important considerations - it`s just that a singular focus on them to the exclusion of all else is, in my opinion, counter productive.  In that respect the Fusion Challenge seems to have prompted a response from me...is that the media doing something to get me, at least superficially, interested in the Fusion??I think there is a difference between \"media\" and advertising. Yes, advertising is delivered through different media but I think that when someone here complains about the media giving preferential treatment to a particular car model, he or she means the journalists reporting about the cars. The complaint is about a perceived bias toward that car.Advertising is very biased. That\\'s kind of the point, isn\\'t it? So the Fusion Challenge is an example of good advertising because it gets people to consider a car that they might not have, not an example of unbiased media.  \"I too loved the 1977 Accord I owned.

It was certainly best in class for my dollar as well, and that\\'s all that needs to be said on my part. Analyzing forum posts is something that the host doesn\\'t take kindly to.  I drove an Altima was it was pretty good, The Camry seemed to heavy and cumbersome to me. I am an old hot rodder and have had couple of sports cars too.

Out handles the Camry and beats the Altima to 60, 80, 1/4mi, and 100.Can you tell I love my XR?The underdog that took Car of the Year. Saturn is leading GM into the next generation of automobiles with European styling .  I think the best decision GM has taken in the recent years is to get the Euro Opels here and sell them as Saturns. The Aura is a strong contender and I have only heard good things about, expecially with the 3.6.I haven\\'t been inside one yet; but externally it sure looks very nice.

Especially when it is on my Auras key-fob  sounds like a very nice car saw the opel version when i was in greece last year - i was hoping we\\'d end up with one of those for a rental...no luck!enjoy your aura!!-thene   You need to look where I put the comma so that it would make sense to you.I\\'ve got lots more to say based on all that I\\'ve read but our good host has said we are done with this discussion and I wholeheartedly agree. :sick:  oh no, I \\'get it\\' exactly for what it is - horse puckey! The same magazine that you like the results from when Ford pays for it, comes up with a different result when Ford doesn\\'t - and you don\\'t think Ford paying for the test (and stacking the deck) had anything to do with the results? I give up - believe what you wish - but I do have some swampland in Phoenix.  Has anyone used the OEM (not the lil wire hanging out of your tape deck to your iPod, not the thing that makes it play on FM, and not the aftermarket adapters) integrated iPod player unit on any of the cars in this class?I believe the Nissan with the bazilion dollar technology pkg has Bluetooth hands free. Is that an option on any of the other vehicles?  Let\\'s move past the comparison that Ford paid for, that the Fusion won, that regular people decided, or however that went.We have wasted way too much bandwith arguing about it and I\\'m sure we can find other subjects to, um, banter about. Move on please...  Isn\\'t it ironic, that even though the Toyota Camry is the lowest Consumer Rated midsize sedan on this site, that it still sells more and now Toyota is the biggest car co.?  Well, out of 450,000 Camry owners, I\\'d say 300 people surveyed allows for a pretty large margin of error. That goes for any of the consumers surveyed for any of the cars.I\\'m not a Camry advocate, by any means, as I\\'ve never owned a Toyota (they\\'re too boring for my tastes).  There seems to be an incredible amount of discussion on forums about \"resale value\" and \"true cost to own\". I just realized that I never even gave any thought about either, when I bought any of my cars or trucks. I say buy the car you like best, and you will likely want to keep it longer. Then, \"resale value\" and \"true cost to own\" will take care of itself. If you buy a car you don\\'t really like, you will probably get rid of it sooner, defeating the purpose.  As I remember - the warranty paid to repair a blown air conditioner twice, to fix the front brakes, and to replace both front head light assemblies(kept filling with water). Biggest problem - the car ate tires at an alarming rate. The dealer kept telling me it was fine, and, Firestone kept telling me it couldn\\'t be aligned. I went through 4 sets of tires before I traded it off. The last set lasted for the duration of a trip to the beach - the car was eating the radials so bad that little strips of rubber were coming off the tread. After that I decided to punt.Regards:OldCEM  I fought the rust the whole time I owned it. Biggest problem area with mine was the rear fender liners. Every spring they\\'d be rotted out and I\\'d patch in new sheet metal and apply rust killer. What finally killed mine - the oil pump drive gears failed.Regards:OldCEM  My guess is you didn\\'t replace or turn the rotors as specified in the manual (its not a super big deal, I have done that in the past as well with other vehicles- it just leads to accelerated pad wear and increases the likelihood of chatter, squeal, and uneven braking) I decided getting the rotors turned was unnecessary. I have never had to replace rotors on any car or truck. No problems with wear, chatter, squeal, or uneven braking either. Even if the pads wore a little faster (which I doubt since I only changed them once in 140k miles) I think I could have changed them twice as often, doing it myself, for less than paying someone else to change them, and turn the rotors making them thinner, and weaker.

Did you at least check to make sure the rotors were above minimum thickness? It might also be related to locality. Where the car lived in CA, there were hills that required brakeing. If you lived in Nebraska or Kansas, it might be less of an issue.  Your Aura is a really nice car and as you put it quick too. Your price of $26K for all you mentioned is strong too and a great buy for all that car. Not as good as the Altima SE in the slalom, not as big inside, and not a lot of bells and whistles, but with Nissan you really pay for those extras. My premium package added $4,400 and stability control another $900 bringing the sticker to $30,045, I paid $27,200. Enjoy your ride....and oh yes, when your car is governed at 124mph I\\'ll still have about 25mph more to play with, ha. Not suggesting we do that however.  Finally, something worth responding to.Rotors only need to be turned if they\\'re out of spec on runout. A few hard stops will normally clear any surface glaze or rust on the rotor or pads. Turning the rotors and putting in new pads is the equivalent of rebooting your computer to fix an error. It\\'s quick and easy and usually fixes the problem - at least temporarily.

It\\'s quick and easy and usually fixes the problem - at least temporarily.Its not the rust and the glaze you want to get rid of, its the grooves. When new pads go on grooved rotors, they wear \"funny\" and that creates the griding and squealing. The more aggressive the pad, the more friction, the better the braking performance. Certain OEMs that have softer pads to protect the rotors are also criticized for having brakes that are considered not as strong as those of competitors (and excessive brake dust).I personally have had good luck with Axxis metal-master pads (or Hawks for the track events), and Brembo blanks (about the same as the OEM rotor from the dealer).  :shades: :shades: :shades: I found the money for the important thing better spent than what I could have gotten for $26K from Nissan, Toyota, or even Hyundai. I didn\\'t get an arm rest in the back seat, but I didn\\'t have to pay extra for split lay-down rear seat. I did get a sound system for the rear seat that has it\\'s own radio tuner and can select a CD from the 6 CD changer up front, It comes with two wireless headphone so the passengers in back don\\'t have to listen to mom and dads choice up front.Saturn put tinny red led\\'s in the roof console\\'s to give ambient red light on the interior at night. You can actually see stuff now that used to be hidden in the dark. I have never seen this and don\\'t know if red LEDs in the roof is normal for today\\'s sport sedans or not, but it is really cool.Every time I get in this new car I find something else that blows my mind. :shades: :shades:  Its great when you find something that meets your needs and your budget and makes you feel good about driving. Congrats on your purchase.The ambient lighting is a big deal, Audi started it in the 90s, and now other manufacturers are chiming in as the price of LEDs comes down. I\\'m glad you like the technology.  ambient red light on the interior at nightThe higher end Accords have this feature.  To me paying $150-200 per axle for brake pads and turning rotors, to be sure the brakes will be as good as they can be is cheap insurance. For us the fronts have typically lasted at least 50,000 miles and rears (drums) about double that or more. By my calculation this will come to less than $600 for 150,000 miles, or less than 1/2 cent per mile.So which of these cars have those softer pads to protect rotors at the expense of reduced braking performance?  So which of these cars have those softer pads to protect rotors at the expense of reduced braking performance?Cons Brakes should be more powerful, missing some of the premium features being offered by newer competitors, Hybrid model\\'s disappointing fuel economy.  This is a great thread.IMHO; it\\'s not how hard or soft the pads are that cause the groves. It\\'s not the groves that cause squealing or chattering when the pads come in contact with the rotors. Disk brake manufacturers have a spec for the depth of a grove that requires turning as well as a spec for the thickness of the rotors. The brake shop will know what the specs are. A good shop wont do the job if you don\\'t want to turn rotors that the manufactures says need it. If you do the job yourself, like I usually do you have know the specs before you start. In my nearly 50 years of experience, which goes back before disk brakes were used on US automobiles, I have developed the following guidelines (for myself only). If the groves are less than 0.002\" I leave them alone. If any are over o.oo2\" deep I turn the rotors.What causes the minor groves in the rotors is dirt, sand, and tinny metal par ticals picked up from the road. It doesn\\'t make any difference what the pads are made of, they will all pick up this junk and scratch/grove your rotors.Replace your pads with a compound that best meets your driving style. Don\\'t put on metallic pads designed for racing, just because you think it\\'s cool. Don\\'t use soft OEM pads if you do a lot of \"performance\" driving on mountain roads. Metallics take time to heat up to a useful temperature and soft pads fade after a few hard stops.  IMHO; it\\'s not how hard or soft the pads are that cause the groves. It\\'s not the groves that cause squealing or chattering when the pads come in contact with the rotors.That has been different then my experience, but I have also used some very aggressive brake pads. On a track environment, there is very little debris to pick up and get stuck in your pads. If you have a hard, aggressive pad and a soft rotor, the rotor is going to get eaten.If you do the job yourself, like I usually do you have know the specs before you start. Yeah, its been a very long time since anyone other than myself touched my brakes. I usually have to borrow the dial gauge to check for warping.Replace your pads with a compound that best meets your driving style. Don\\'t put on metallic pads designed for racing, just because you think it\\'s cool. Don\\'t use soft OEM pads if you do a lot of \"performance\" driving on mountain roads. Metallics take time to heat up to a useful temperature and soft pads fade after a few hard stops.This is an incredibly valid point. Hawks I would only use for racing (although they have a street pad, its pretty pricey), while the Axxis pads have a cool enough thermal range to work well on the street (which is their intended use).When I would do HDPE stuff, a lot of times guys would leave their racing pads on at the end of the day and drive back to the hotel. Then, first thing in the morning they would get up, jump in their car and head for the MickyD\\'s drive thru, where they would then realize how poorly stone cold racing pads work as they rear-end the vehicle in front of them. :sick:  The way I hear it, the shims and whatever that greasy stuff that goes between them are what keeps the brakes from chattering and squealing. I have never had any rotors turned, and so far (knock on wood) I haven\\'t had a problem with brakes. I see many posts about warped rotors and pads wearing prematurely, and it makes me wonder if all these people live in the mountains, where riding the brakes down hill would be harder on pads and rotors than the flatlands in south Louisiana. I have heard how much of a pain it was to remove the rotors on 90\\'s Accords (some have actually converted them to rotor over hub using old Acura CL parts). I must be easy on brakes cause I\\'ve never experienced this (knock on wood again).   Not to mention, the camry did win motor trend car of the year for 2007  For us the fronts have typically lasted at least 50,000 miles and rears (drums) about double that or more.That\\'s about normal. 80% of your braking is done in the front.  Turning the rotors and putting in new pads is the equivalent of rebooting your computer to fix an error. It\\'s quick and easy and usually fixes the problem Not so quick or easy on 4th generation Accords. Thankfully I never had to do it. My rotors were still good when I sold it.  Cons  Brakes should be more powerful, missing some of the premium features being offered by newer competitors, Hybrid model\\'s disappointing fuel economy.Thanks for the clue, but wouldn\\'t it have been easier to just name the model :confuse: . Accord was what popped into my head when I read your reference to weak brakes.  I was talking about the dealer. Changing pads and turning rotors is easier than trying to figure out the real problem.  I was talking about the dealer.Ok, sure the dealer loves doing brake jobs (easy $$$). I\\'m not taking rotors off, unless there is a problem.  My brother\\'s \\'85 Accord went through pads and rotors like crazy. Every time the car needed pads he had to replace the rotors. Rotors were to thin to \"turn\". Maintenance on that Accord was quite expensive when anything broke down. Headlight burned out, needed new headlight assembly (I guess many of today\\'s cars are like that so Honda was truly ahead of everyone else). A broken radio antennae (a top of the right side A pillar) required tearing apart the dash board. Hmmmm...\\'85 Accord, look at what Honda had done since. \\'88 Excel, look at what Hyundai has done since. And Hyundai only became dedicated to becoming a real player in the USA in the last 5 to 10 years.  I certainly can\\'t explain your brother\\'s problem, but I have had none of the same. I do think that\\'s enough about brakes on the \"Midsize Sedan\" forum.  The point is that his Honda Accord, which he never chose to consider again, was a 1985. Honda has improved. Yet, some people choose to rag on all Hyundai models because Hyundai made some crummy cars in the late 1980\\'s to early 1990\\'s. Look at what has happened to computers in the last 15 years...wasn\\'t it 1992 or \\'93 that IBM brought out it\\'s first PC, at about $10,000? How many people buy an IBM PC now when there are so many equally as good products available? Yep, some will still pay a premium price for the IBM name (brand loyalty). Others have learned they can get much greater value for their dollar from other brands and \"clones.\"  I\\'m glad you keep your car for a long time, I also try to buy cars that I can see myself owning for a long time. However, people often get rid of cars for reasons other than not liking it. Maybe you have a kid and need to trade in your 2 seat convertible. Or the kids go off to college and you no longer need your minivan. Or you get a promotion, and that new Corolla CE doesn\\'t quite have the panache that you desire.I wouldn\\'t be surprised that on average, a new car stays with the original owner for five years before being sold. So yes, resale value is often (although not always) important.In 2000, I bought a new Chrysler 300M (a great car BTW and still going strong at 120K miles) for 30K. Today it\\'s worth around 5K. If I would have bought a 20K Accord, it would probably still be worth about 10K. Fortunately, I\\'m not in a situation where I have to sell the car. High resale value was one of the numerous reasons we bought an \\'06 Accord. We figured if our needs changed down the road, we wouldn\\'t take a bath on the car if we sold it.  The Fusion is a great looking car, and may be equal to the Accord in some areas. One area where the Accord seems to be ahead of the Fusion is when both are equipped with the base engine and a manual transmission. Here\\'s what the Consumer Guide says:\"With manual transmission, 4-cyl Fusions are adequate at best and feel slower than our test car\\'s 9.2 sec 0-60 time would suggest. Inordinately heavy clutch action, balky shift linkage makes manual transmission unpleasant to use.\"In contrast:\"Four cyl Accords peppy enough with slick-shifting manual transmission; test EX coupe did 7.9 seconds 0-60 mph.\"The Accord sedan weighs about 75 lbs more, but should still get from 0-60 in less than 8.5 seconds.So, the Accord\\'s transmission seems to be smoother, and its engine is slightly larger and more powerful, and yet the EPA rates the 4-cyl Accord with manual at 26/34, while the Fusion is rated 23/31. For some models the Fusion may be close to equal, but for this base model it seems the Accord is substantially ahead. Of course, the Accord probably costs about $2000 more. But it appears that a good chunk of that money goes into a better engine and transmission.  That was exactly my experience when I drove both cars. The base Fusion felt significantly slower and less responsive.Was that Accord 0-60 time from before they bumped the power for the 2006 model year? Car and Driver clocks my exact car, a 2007 Accord LX Sedan 5-speed manual, 0-60 in 7.5 seconds.  Look at what has happened to computers in the last 15 years...wasn\\'t it 1992 or \\'93 that IBM brought out it\\'s first PC, at about $10,000?

IBMs business model doesn\\'t really include personal computers anymore, as they tend to leave the low rent stuff to the myrads of offshore companies that specialize in that. IBM is more of a value add/service provider to integrate business machines into organizations.I think a better example of people paying a premium might be Apple but that is a whole other discussion   a 2007 Accord LX Sedan 5-speed manual, 0-60 in 7.5 secondsthat\\'s pretty quick for a 4 banger - but understand that those times are relative to whose doing the testing, the specific car, and even test conditions. C&D seems to specialize in milking the best 0-60 times out of all cars, they must have \\'car abuse king\\' testers that compete! Not to say that you personally might not be able to do the same thing, but I doubt seriously that 99% of us are going to be able to get the car to 60 in less than 8 seconds, and while the CG test is more conservative, perhaps might get closer to that 9+ time in the Fusion 4 banger. A big difference nonetheless, as you say, however. If you like 4 bangers, Honda would still be superior.  \"2007 Accord LX Sedan 5-speed manual, 0-60 in 7.5 seconds - that\\'s pretty quick for a 4 banger\" That\\'s the beauty of the current \"horsepower war\" - everything is faster, even the 4 bangers. My last sedan was a Mazda 626 with a V6 generating 170 HP and 165 TQ. It would go 0-60 in 7.2 seconds when equipped with a manual. The 4-banger in the Accord has become just as powerful and very nearly as fast as most V6s of 5-10 years ago, especially when you consider the new revised power ratings.Normally I\\'d agree with you about the C&D testing procedures and a car being faster in their hands than in the hands of the average driver, but I don\\'t think that applies to the Accord. Here\\'s why: the average car is considerably slower in the more conservative 5-60 test than in the all-out 0-60 run, but the difference is only 0.4 seconds for the Accord. The Accord\\'s 5-60 time of 7.9 seconds is on par with cars that go faster 0-60. Additionally, most cars that match its 0-60 time of 7.5 seconds have a slower 5-60 time. Bottom line? Just as some cars feel slower than their specs on paper suggest, in my opinion the Accord drives faster than its spec sheet suggests.  The main reason, IMO, that the Accord is such a nice car with manual is that it\\'s the same exact car they sell in Japan. Almost everyone in Japan drives manual, and the 4 cylinder engine is the \"big\" engine over in Japan - or about as big as most people pay for since the taxes are based upon displacement(with 2.5L+ being the premium category with almost twice the yearly registration of a 2.0L)Ford - they build their manuals like GM does - something to make the car go for the ultra-cheap model. And it plainly shows.  the \\'feeling\\' of quickness probably has something to do with torque and where that torque peaks. Torque may not influence acceleration times in the same way that HP does, but it sure does help with some drivability issues as well as that \\'feeling\\' of quickness.Have a sneaking suspicion that some test driver for a C&D road test is revving the heck out of that Accord and then, popping the clutch in a trial/error process attempting to squeeze a few tenths here and there. My point was, that this is not likely something you would do to your own car and a degree of abuse that the vast majority of drivers never do - therefore, you \\'real\\' 0-60 should be slower - as would it be for all cars.  Not sure I buy the 9.2 sec for manual transmission 4 cyl Fusion. If it is accurate, then little is lost in going to the automatic. CR, which tests the way a normal person would drive got 9.5 for the 4 cyl automatic in a Milan.It\\'s difficult to believe one could get 9.5 sec by just flooring an automatic, but only improve that to 9.2 driving the manual in an abusive manner.  there are a few cases, the DSG Porsche 911 comes to mind, where the autos will actually outaccelerate the manuals. Not many but it can happen. In any case, maybe not nearly as much mechanical gain with the stick as what you might think?  Have a sneaking suspicion that some test driver for a C&D road test is revving the heck out of that Accord and then, popping the clutch in a trial/error process attempting to squeeze a few tenths here and there. My point was, that this is not likely something you would do to your own car and a degree of abuse that the vast majority of drivers never do - therefore, you \\'real\\' 0-60 should be slower - as would it be for all cars.  That\\'s where the 5-60 test comes in. There\\'s no revving and popping the clutch in a 5-60 test, it\\'s already in gear with the clutch out, and rolling 5mph. The only variable there would be how much throttle to give (and resulting wheelspin if any). Accord is only 4 tenths slower to 60 in that test than the standard 0-60, whereas most other cars (like the Fusion) have a larger 0-60/5-60 difference.Car and Driver test results:Accord I4 5M0-60 mph 7.5 Street start, 5-60 mph 7.9Fusion I4 5M0-60 mph 8.1 Street start, 5-60 mph 9.0Difference:0-60 0.65-60 1.1See my point? If you look at the C&D 0-60 test as a high-revving, clutch-popping, tire-smoking drag strip launch, and the 5-60 test as more of a \"real world\" run, you can see what I mean about the Accord feeling faster than similiar cars under any (but particularly those) circumstances. There\\'s not much difference between the two driving styles in the Accord.  the 5-60 test as more of a \"real world\" runOK, have to agree with that, but you do have to wonder how far past redline they run the things (the Honda engine maybe a little more willing and able to do that) and possibly even \\'slam shifting\\' sans the clutch.  You\\'re correct. I should have said \\'82 or \\'83 regarding the IBM PC. Thanks.Other PC makers, not as well know as the IBM name, were offering similar computers for far less money. That was my point in comparing computers to cars.  Other PC makers, not as well know as the IBM name, were offering similar computers for far less money.That was my point in comparing computers to cars.That is a valid point, but there is a warning in that market as well. Companies like eMachines build dispoable computers that are designed for maintenance, they are designed to be tossed if an component fails, since they are integrated into the mobo.  These numbers are not \"considerably faster\" as you stated. .6 seconds? and 1.1 seconds? I hardly doubt anyone test driving these sedans is really going to feel the difference. I would be most people who shop 4cyl sedans don\\'t really care about 0-60 times. Most who do get the V6\\'s I would bet. :shades:  looks to be the most liked by thier owners with a whopping 9.6! I am starting to see more and more on the internet about the new Malibu. Looks like Chevy is making a move back into the sedan arena.  As far as that 1.1 seconds goes, I can feel it in something as insignificant as highway passing. I can feel it in off-the-line response. And, if the numbers aren\\'t considerably faster, the way in which the car accelerates is much more effortless versus the Fusion in my perception. \"Considerably faster\" is subjective, my friend.I got the 4-cylinder. Acceleration wasn\\'t tops on my list, but when I could get good the best fuel economy from a car that was also quicker than many (all at the time, actually)of its competing 4-cylinders, I knew I had found my car.I guess I\\'m not \"most\" though. Referencing post 480, the Aura has to be the best offering from GM in the midsize arena in a dozen years. GM should\\'ve imported Opels all-along, they have to be better than things like the late \\'90s Lumina.I\\'m glad to see GM finally having some products it can be proud of other than trucks. As I see it, Ford should be proud of its Fusion, but perfuming the pig on the Focus and Escape? Shame on you Ford. You succeeded with an all-new Fusion and it receives great reviews, can\\'t you give us a new Escape and Focus in less than 8 years? Or will the Fusion be around, with nothing new but a fascia, in 8 years? I certainly hope not. The bar is moving way too fast for that.  \"These numbers are not \"considerably faster\" as you stated. .6 seconds? and 1.1 seconds? I hardly doubt anyone test driving these sedans is really going to feel the difference. I would be most people who shop 4cyl sedans don\\'t really care about 0-60 times.

Well, lets look at some examples.A 1.1 second faster 5-60 time than the Accord 2.4L 5M would be 6.8 seconds. That would be just AHEAD of a 2007 Ford Mustang 4.0L V6 manual, which finished 1st place in the C&D \"Quickest Cars under $20,000\" article (in which the Accord 2.4L 5M finished 6th). Think you could feel that difference?One more 1.1 second increment? Now you are just 0.1 second behind the 2007 Ford Mustang GT 4.6L V8 manual in a 5-60 run. How about that difference?The difference between the Accord and the Fusion in a realistic \"real world, street start\" 5-60 mph run is nearly the same as the difference between a Mustang V6 and a Mustang GT in the same test... That is something anybody is definately gonna feel. I would know, I\\'ve driven all of those cars recently!   GM should\\'ve imported Opels all-alonggrad - they kinda have - remember the Cimarron that I think went off the market back in the late 80s, and there also is a lot of \\'Opel\\' in the CTS as well. Agree about GM finally getting its act together though (and Ford\\'s inability to keep up) - it will interesting to see if a \\'good\\' Malibu can \\'sell\\' without the now traditional GM discount structures as this would obviously be good for GM as well. Folks that go out and shop Camcords expect to negotitate from window sticker, those that shop the US brands expect something much more. It would seem that if the Aura is going to be sold the way they are (\\'no nonsense\\' pricing) that the consumer is going to expect the new Malibu with a good size discount, meaning that GM would have to artificially inflate the sticker to accomodate the discounts - like what they do with Buicks.  Yes my altima has that ambient lighting too. Kinda cool, just not sure the reasoning behind it. Mine is pointed at the center counsel and gives off a orangy red tint.  Maybe it is just my old bones, but I really find it very hard to believe that ANYONE could possibly feel the difference in cars accelerating 0-60 or 5-60 when the time difference is less than a timed 1 second. Some say even .1 sec...come-on. I have driven multiple cars in various \"speed acceleration trials\" and can\\'t imagine determining that kind of difference given that time frame. Now, change it to 3 or 4 seconds, then maybe it would be noticeable. Sorry, but that is my opinion with these comments, and of course I, like anyone else may be wrong.van :confuse:   Hey! You buy a Honda, Toyota, or Nissan with a small 4 banger and a 5 or 6 speed stick, you buy it for economy. Thank you for doing that. If you have to drive a lot of miles and pay $3.40/gal like we do in California, you should have a small econobox. So what\\'s up with all this banter about 0-60, 5-60 etc?The cars are all about MPG, not acceleration.I don\\'t drive a lot of miles and preferred acceleration and comfort so I opted for the Aura XR. Choices based on needs, so what if your car is a second slower than the other guys?  Considering how far a vehicle travels at 60mph in one second, I think it would be noticeable. On the other hand the sound of the engine, the way the transmission shifts, and suspension can make a car feel faster than it really is. This was commented on by a reviewer in the 03 \"Midsize Sedan Comparison\" test. The reviewer commented that because the 03 Altima engine was louder, and suspension stiffer, it felt like it was faster than the 03 Accord, when in reality it wasn\\'t.  I have driven 4,6,& 8 cyl vehicles with standard and auto trans in sundry speed options. I have driven for speed and for economy, but now am very happy to go for safety and comfort overall. My comments were related to the \"feeling of differences\" in the 0-60 areas being less than 1 second. Personally I don\\'t care about the other guys speed either, I opted for my needs. However I just felt that some of the comments here were stretching the point of reality, thus my input. van  So if you drove around in a Mustang V6 for a while, and then switched to a Mustang GT, you really don\\'t think you would notice much difference? Pulling out into traffic? Merging onto the highway? Both cars would feel the same to you?I was able to feel a difference in how they responded to throttle inputs without even driving the cars fast. I\\'d bet that the average driver would notice as well.I know we aren\\'t talking about Mustangs here, but the difference between the 5-60 times of the two Mustangs is nearly identical to the difference between the Fusion/Mazda6 4-cylinder and the Accord.  I don\\'t, and wasn\\'t, disagreeing with anything you said. Fact is I agree with you comments about how significant a second is in 0-60 times. Anyone that has been street racing or just doing the stoplight grand prix, will KNOW THE DIFFERENCE of a few tenths, especially if they come in second place time after time.I hate to be second, it\\'s just another word for looser.I used to drive a car with a 2.5L turbo and 5 speed. It was a few tenths quicker than the Mustang 5.0 to 60 and in the 1/4. It got the same MPG as the Mustang too, which proves it takes X amount of Gasoline to make Y amount of power and propel Z weight to V velocity in a specified T time.Physics?  Hey why does it have to be one or the other (performance OR economy)? I feel like a got a pretty good mix of both, especially considering the price.  My point wasn\\'t that you wouldn\\'t feel a difference, but rather that your \"feelings\" would not be able to tell whether that difference was one or the other if the time difference was less than a second going 0-60 or thereabouts. Both would show acceleration, and give a feeling thereof. If the ONLY difference was less than 1 second of time, or less than that, do you think you would know which one was faster. I personally think not, but then again I have been wrong before. I am considering ONLY THE FEELING, and determining from that.van  So if you drove around in a Mustang V6 for a while, and then switched to a Mustang GT, you really don\\'t think you would notice much difference?I doubt you would, not in the 0-60 times. Your talking about standing on the gas and running 2nd gear out to almost (if not) 60 mph. either car, or the altima, fussion, camry, accord for that matter, is going to feel like its going extremly fast. I can\\'t see noticing a second difference. And thats what separates a v6 mustang from a GT. you don\\'t have to push it so hard to get those kind of results. You\\'ll notice the difference in normal driving far more than when your pushing the car as hard as you can. In fact, the thing you\\'ll notice most about the GT is how easily the thing will take off, without having to give it a lot of gas.  Hey why does it have to be one or the other (performance OR economy)? I feel like a got a pretty good mix of both, especially considering the price.Glad to hear it. I too think I got performance and economy. I guess those two terms are relative. I think for a performance car it should be able to do ov er 95 in a 1/4 mile, do it in under 15 seconds. 0-60 should be as close to 6 seconds as you can get, quicker if you can afford it. Top speed isn\\'t real important because I hardly ever want to go over 100 anyway.On the economy side I like 30 MPG but had to give up 2 for the performance I wanted. So, for about $26K I get 0-60 in 5.9, 1/4 mile in 14.7 @97MPH and fantastic ride, handling and comfort. But I only get 28MPG highway and 22 in the city.Relatively speaking, good enough for me.  Personally, 0-60, 5-60, or 1/4 mile times are not the reason I wanted a V6 engine. Passing and merging power, are more important. When I am on one of the single lane roads, and there is a Sunday driver in front of me doing 45 in a 55mph zone, I want to be able to pass him quickly without needing 1/2 mile clear of on-coming traffic, to do it safely. Beating the guy next to me at the red light to the next red light is not necessary, and I see no point in it.  Ummm... the Cimarron was a rebadged Cavalier with more chrome and a leather interior--NOT an Opel.  Backy, you are absolutely correct - the Cadillac Cimarron was a rebadged Chevy Cavalier, as was the Olds Firenza, Pontiac Sunbird, and Buick Skyhawk. All were built on the economy-car GM J-platform, and were simply known as J-Cars. The Cimarron\\'s failure was one of the reasons the Cadillac division almost filed for bankruptcy in the late \\'80s.See this link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_CimarronPerhaps captain2 was thinking of the more recent Cadillac Catera, which was a rebadged Opel Omega - see the link below for this info:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Catera  I doubt you would, not in the 0-60 times. Your talking about standing on the gas and running 2nd gear out to almost (if not) 60 mph. either car, or the altima, fussion, camry, accord for that matter, is going to feel like its going extremly fast. I can\\'t see noticing a second difference. Again, I had a Mazda6 V6 with manual trans and now have a Mustang GT with manual trans. The Mazda was rated by C&D at somewhere around 6.5 seconds to 60, the Mustang\\'s best I\\'ve ever seen was 4.9 seconds. I\\'ll be perfectly honest, I just can\\'t shift that fast nor do I abuse my cars like they do to get those times. However, I can say that jd10013 makes a good point. There are times that I look down at the speedo of the Mustang, after taking off from a stop hard and fast on my way home from work, and see that I\\'m doing 80 or 90 MPH. I\\'m still used to seeing 60 MPH at those same points in the road which is how fast I\\'d have been going in the 6 at that point. I then realize how much faster the Mustang is but up until I look down it just feels like I\\'m going really fast regardless of which car I was in. So the feeling is the same in a hard launch IMO. You fell like you\\'re going really fast. How fast you are really going isn\\'t realized until you look at the gauges. That\\'s when the \"I\\'m going to pee my pants\" feeling kicks in.   Isn\\'t it a great feeling that you can match or exceed any current freeway speed while still on the onramp? Some cars can only match it during rush hour in LA   Perhaps captain2 was thinking of the more recent Cadillac Cateraperhaps I was, sorry. Opel has been a long time subsidiary of GM and first imported some rather nasty tin cans in the 50s and 60s. Circa the early 70s a midsize sedan (at that time) the Opel Manta 1900 was a really well designed car, so much so that it became an autocross favorite. Think the exchange rate got it though, because I believe it later became a Japanese Isuzu by by mid 70s, marketed as always by Buick.  >the thing you\\'ll notice most about the GT is how easily the thing will take off, without having to give it a lot of gas. That\\'s right on. High torque at low engine speeds really feels great. Always has. Always will.  I\\'m with you. For $25K 0 to 60 in 5.3 and up to 27 mpg on the highway. Extremely versatile with AWD and a huge sunroof. I\\'ve given up some economy for performance. Although this car isn\\'t on the list of linked cars for this thread, the model is made by a manufacturer on the list.Downside, driving the car as if it had two speeds, on or off, gas mileage suffers. The equation f=ma still holds true. Without a big heavy V8 in the nose, lightweight high-output cars feel much more balanced.  Isn\\'t it a great feeling that you can match or exceed any current freeway speed while still on the onramp? Some cars can only match it during rush hour in LA It is quite a rush! Of course I lose a good bit of convenience havint two small children when compared to the cars compared in this thread. So far I have no problem with that though.Why during rush hour in L.A.? Because you have to go that fast to keep up? I always thought rush hour in L.A. was bumper to bumper? :confuse:  It\\'s either going 75mph or 25mph. Not much inbetween. (busy counting the days until I can leave L.A.)  Some cars can only match it during rush hour in LAWhy during rush hour in L.A.? Because you have to go that fast to keep up? I always thought rush hour in L.A. was bumper to bumper?My point was obvious to me when I wrote it. Rush Hour in LA is stop and go, speeding along at 0-10MPH. That\\'s when the wimpy econo boxes and (many) of the Hybrids can get up to a safe merge speed. Said with tong-in-cheek humor inflection  I grew up and learned to drive in LA. I would go stark raving nuts if I had to drive it every day now.Out here in the So.Cal desert, you better be up to 75MPH, or more, at the end of the onramp or a Tractor-Trailer might just run over you. :shades:  liked by thier owners with a whopping 9.6!well maybe, if you are willing to put up with the \\'old\\' pushrod 3.5 and the even older 4 spped tranny. That would be the XE not the 3.6 XR which will \\'run\\' with about any of the \\'better\\' cars in this class. The Malibu so equipped may well make an impact, the versions of the last several years dull at best. Don\\'t know if GM is going to be able to sell it at much of a profit however - if the autobuyer is going to spend something north of $25k for a car, they are not likely to want it to have a Chevy nameplate on it in this class. Same problem that I see the Sonata having.

And yes the Altima, Camry, the Sonata, the Saturn XR, and the Accord V6 will all get well into the 6s and run 15s (or less) 90+ mph quarters. So is it worth not sweating that tractor-trailer, buyer\\'s choice - you pay a whole coupla hundred bucks a year for the \\'privilege\\'.

The thing is, where I live and where my parents live (two large but not GIANT cities - Birmingham, AL, and Oklahoma CIty) there isn\\'t one place where my 4-cylinder Accord ever has close calls due to lacking power. When my 4-cylinder Accord can out-accelerate the massive number of Tahoes and Expeditions on the road, I don\\'t feel that extra power is a need. It is a want, and that\\'s ok, but it isn\\'t one of My needs. The mixed city average of 29 MPG with upper 30s to 40 MPG highway money in this college student\\'s pocket, too!  There is a town about 20 miles away from where I live, and we travel this road often. It\\'s a single lane road with not many areas to pass. If I get behind a slow-poke (going 40mph in a 55mph zone) in the first 5 miles I may only get one or two chances to pass him. There are times when if I only had a 4cyl, I would have to follow the slow-poke the entire 20 miles. With the V6, I don\\'t need much of a gap to complete the pass. My wife says I am obsessed with not wanting to follow behind other cars, and she may be right about that. I agree grad, that the V6 is not necessary, but it sure is nice, in these situations.  Sure it is, but of course, fast is relative. You\\'ll remember my other car is a 130 hp Accord with a 4-speed auto, so the 5-speed auto 166 horsepower Accord is as much faster to me, as the 244 hp is to the 166 hp with you. In my 130 hp car, I typically don\\'t challenge people trying to race around me to cut me off, but in my 166 hp Accord, it is much easier.I say all this to say: I understand exactly where you\\'re coming from.To my friend I graduated high school with, my cars are \"slow, and slower.\" Of course, his FIRST car was an Acura 2.5TL with 175 hp, and his current car is a 3.2CL with 225 hp. To ME however, my cars are \"adequate, and quick.\"It is all relative.  It is all relative.  My previous Accord was 140hp, and I was happy with it for a long time. If I would have test driven only a 4cyl.(and not the V6) when I was shopping, I probably would have bought one, and been satisfied with it. I tried the V6 out, and that was it, I couldn\\'t go back. Did you try the V6 out, when you were shopping?  Isn\\'t it great we live in a country where we have so many choices?I liven in Colorado where Subaru\\'s with Turbos rule the mountain roads. Just a few miles away, in Kansas, any 4 banger will do because the altitude is low (lots of air) and the highest hill is 2 feet hi.In California, I need and want HP with moderate MPG.Thank a soldier for helping you have a choice.  I had driven a 2003 V6 Accord before, and honestly, can\\'t tell much difference around town. Either car will bark the tires from a stop (meaning it is more than enough for this teenager\\'s insurance! ). On the highway is where the V6 shows its difference. I tried several of the Accord\\'s competitors V6s, but their extra power didn\\'t help me overcome their interiors (Sonata, Fusion) or overall boredom (Camry). I didn\\'t need to drive a V6 Accord (the price was more than I wanted to pay, and a really fast car isn\\'t what I [or my folks] were after) because the 4-cylinder was much more than necessary, and plenty of fun.  There are times when if I only had a 4cyl, I would have to follow the slow-poke the entire 20 miles.Only if you don\\'t know how to pass correctly. :P The 45-65 passing acceleration time differs by maybe 0.5 to 1.0 seconds between these 4 and 6 cylinders. I think this means you\\'d need maybe 40-80 feet extra acceleration space for the 4 cyl. All this means is that you would have to back off that little bit further behind, so that you can accelerate in your own lane and then execute the passing maneuver while spending the same amount of time in the other lane as you would with the V6.  My point was obvious to me when I wrote it. Rush Hour in LA is stop and go, speeding along at 0-10MPH. That\\'s when the wimpy econo boxes and (many) of the Hybrids can get up to a safe merge speed. Said with tong-in-cheek humor inflection I grew up and learned to drive in LA. I would go stark raving nuts if I had to drive it every day now. Got it now. I figured you were making a joke but I just wasn\\'t getting it at the time. :shades:  All this means is that you would have to back off that little bit further behind, so that you can accelerate in your own lane and then execute the passing maneuver while spending the same amount of time in the other lane as you would with the V6. Which is exactly what I had to do with my old 140hp Accord. And it still took longer to get around. Not to mention you don\\'t always have the time for such advanced timing maneuvers. Then sometimes I would accelerate hard, get right up to the rear of the car in front of me, then realize it was too close a call to go for it. Then have to hit the brakes, and maybe try again later. With the V6, I don\\'t spend extra time in preparing to pass. I just hit it, and go. Much easier. I have to admit the 4cyl was a challenge, and actually fun sometimes, when the maneuver worked.   Not to mention, the 4-cylinder Accords have a tossability (is that a word? ) that the V6s just don\\'t have. The V6 is like the grown-up Accord. It\\'s smart, all business. The 4-cylinder isn\\'t as quick, but it seems to have more fun getting there. That may not hold true in everyone\\'s opinion, and that\\'s ok. I don\\'t have to agree with everyone all the time   Not to mention, the 4-cylinder Accords have a tossability (is that a word? ) that the V6s just don\\'t have.The 92 Accord was much smaller, and lighter, and tossability (the word seems to fit, real or not) was it\\'s game. That car was made specifically for a 4cyl engine. A V6 would have never fit under that hood (without a gigantic shoehorn). I feel the current Accord is much more suited for the V6 engine, and not as tossable as the 92, with either engine.  I feel the current Accord is much more suited for the V6 engine, and not as tossable as the 92, with either engine. I hear ya, I just felt like the 4-cylinder was lighter on its feet, although lacking the muscle under the hood that the V6 posseses.Knowing how my 1996 was also a handler in its day makes me want to pony up some $ and replace the shocks and struts. The ones I have are the original stock ones (172k mostly hwy miles). The car handles nicely and predictably, but I can\\'t help but feel it is nowhere as sharp as it once was.The ride on bumpy interstates sure is nice though; much softer than my 06!   The 96 Accord was made larger than the 92 also, to accept the V6 engine available at that time. Accords of all generations handle well though, and therefore fun to drive. I can imagine your Accord (the 06) is a little more fun going fast around corners, but that doesn\\'t stop me from doing it anyway.   The 96 Accord was made larger than the 92 also, to accept the V6 engine available at that time. Yeah, but it was still a compact (trust me, at 6\\'4\" I\\'m an EXCELLENT judge of that ). It also weighs a lithe 2,855 pounds, only about 100 more than the 1990-1993 sedans.Despite the light weight, it is still pretty darn slow when trying to accelerate above 50 MPH. Around town it is plenty adequate though.I\\'ve often wondered what the 0-60 times for my car were (I\\'ve never seen a Car and Driver or Motor Trend test of a 1994-1997 Accord without the V6 or VTEC). Knowing the specs of a Corolla (same horsepower, a little less torque, 300 pounds LIGHTER) and it\\'s acceleration numbers, I can only imagine how dismal mine would be. 11 seconds, maybe? It IS an automatic!  The current Accord is also made for a 4 cylinder/stickshift combination as well. Or at least that\\'s what the vast majority of them in Japan are sold as.And it shows. The car is superb. Only Mazda makes a better manual gearbox/clutch in this price range. It\\'s efortless, revs extremely quickly and smooth as a sewing machine, and you can snap through gears faster than even some automatics.Oh - it\\'s fast as well. Tons faster than the shushomatik. I\\'d have no problem owning one myself and ditching the V6.P.S. For cars that are also sold in Europe(usually under some other name), I like Top Gear\\'s track test. It really nails the actual speed of a car. Much better than the typical 0-60 abuse-fest magazines tend to love.  Not to mention you don\\'t always have the time for such advanced timing maneuvers. I would not call it an \"advanced timing maneuver\", whatever car you are driving the best way to pass is to do most of the accelerating before going into the oncoming lane. Instead most people will tailgate the car in fromt of them, then when they see an opening they swing out into the oncoming lane and then accelerate to pass. Even at 40 mph, the proper minimum following distance is 120 feet, based on the 2 sec rule. I\\'d guess that space should be enough to do most of the acceleration needed for passing, even with \"only\" 150 HP or so in a 3000 pound car. I just can\\'t see ever cutting a passing maneuver so close that 0.5 to 1 sec would make a difference. It\\'s fine that you want a V6, I just don\\'t buy your attempts at rationalizing it as almost a need.  From CR testing, automatic transmissions:0-60 Accord, 4 cyl = 10.4 sec.Accord, V6 = 9.7 sec.Ford Taurus V6 = 9.4Ford Contour 4 cyl = 12 sec.Mercury Mystique 6 cyl = 10.4 secChysler Cirrus, 6 cyl = 9.6 secToyota Camry V6 = 8.6 sec45-65 Accord, 4 cyl = 6.4 sec.Accord V6 = 6.4Ford Taurus V6 = 5.8Ford Contour 4 cyl = 7.7 sec.Mercury Mystique 6 cyl = 6.7 secChysler Cirrus, 6 cyl = 6.4 secToyota Camry V6 = 5.3 sec.Most of the V6 performance numbers from then are around where the 4 cylinders are today.  Car and Driver discovered that the reg auto trans got better mileage than the CVT in the Altima.  In some situations. But its hard to make an apples to apples comparison being as nissan no longer makes auto transmission. The only way to know for sure would be to test an auto altima (which doesn\\'t exist) against a cvt altima. the same way the sticks are compared to autos. but even nissan themselves rate the cvt version as having 1 mpg wors than the stick version. But, the cvt does get better mpg than most any automatic out there, under most driving conditions. It\\' the most fuel efficent auto out there, and very close to a stick. and I believe the comparisson was done with a sentra, that doesn\\'t have the same version in it, and is not as good.But thats not the bennifit of the cvt, not to me at least. It\\'t the way it handles, the acceleration you get at any speed, the overall smoothness of it. and after having drove about 2k miles with it now, i stand by my prediction. In 10 years most cars will have the option of a standard or cvt. the automatic transmission will go the way of the carburator.  I just can`t see ever cutting a passing maneuver so close that 0.5 to 1.0 sec would make a difference. It`s fine that you want a V6, I just don`t buy your attempts at rationalizing it as almost a need Agree with this sentiment totally. This will however likely bring out those few regulars who seem to strongly adhere to the view that \" more and more accleration prowess is directly correlated to greater safety \". As usual , the impossible challenge is to find agreement on what is required so to safely pass another vehicle, or,to safely merge into traffic. Your comments concerning the appropriate TECHNIQUE to pass are right on the mark!!  I wouldn\\'t consider a v6 a need either, but it is fun. I think it just a matter of how far engines and cars have come. I think comparing a v6 to an I4 is like comparing a v8 to a v6 from 20 years ago. add to that better valve systems and much ligher cars and you have cars equiped with I4\\'s that accomodate any driving \"need\". at least in a mid size and up. I think for compact and sub compact cars, the type of engine and its HP is probably more of a concern.  Are you sure you aren\\'t referring to the Versa? C/D did a test of the 4-speed automatic vs. the CVT in the Versa and found the 4-speed got better highway fuel economy. I was not aware that the new Altima even comes with a regular automatic transmission.  I don\\'t think you can get a versa with an automatic either. I believe nissan has switched all their cars to either cvt or stick. this is from a review, can\\'t remember where:\"A CVT has no forward gears or complex clutches and bands. Instead, there are two tapered pulleys with a steel belt connecting them. These pulleys can change their effective diameter through a signal from the computer. If the pulley halves are squeezed together making them narrower, the diameter in effect, increases causing the belt to move to the outer edge. At the same time, the other pulley would spread out causing the diameter to decrease. Changes in the two pulleys are always coordinated to keep the belt taut.If the smaller pulley is being turned by the engine (the drive pulley), the steal belt would turn the larger pulley (the driven pulley) more slowly. If the diameters change, the speed of the driven pulley will also change. By allowing the computer to control the diameters of the two pulleys, the transmission ratio will smoothly and gradually change from low \"gear\" to high \"gear\" This design eliminates the need for a 4 speed, five speed or even a six speed transmission, instead allowing for an infinite number of \"speeds\". The net effect is better fuel economy (at light throttle, the engine rpm is always at the optimal point for maximum fuel efficiency), and better performance (the engine can stay in its sweet spot for maximum horsepower delivery)\"  In fact you can\\'t get a base Versa with the CVT in the U.S., just the 4-speed automatic or 6-speed stick.Which leads to a thought... since the Versa is roomier than some \"mid-sized\" cars, especially in back, is it a mid-sized car? I\\'ll bet most people don\\'t consider it mid-sized, but it can hold four adults in comfort with the best of the mid-sized field. There\\'s a few other small cars like that too, e.g. Elantra and Sentra. I wonder if people who are satisfied with a four-cylinder cross-shop cars like that when looking for a \"mid-sized\" car? FWIW, I do.  Yes, your right. only the 1.8sl offers the cvt. as for the roominess, it has to be less than the altima and sentra, otherwise it wouldn\\'t be considered a sub compact.  Yes, the Versa (95 cubic feet) has less interior volume than the Sentra (97) or Altima (101), but the Versa is actually considered a mid-sized car by the EPA, as are the Sentra and Elantra (98). The Mazda6 is considered a mid-sized car, but has only 96 cubic feet, just one more than the Versa and less than the Sentra and Elantra. The Accord EX has only 98 cubic feet according to Honda. The Legacy has only 93 cubic feet! So these smaller cars match up pretty well in interior room against some of the mid-sized cars. I suspect the Versa is classed a subcompact by some only because of its length. In some countries, it would be considered a \"family car\".  Accord EX has only 98 cubic feet according to Honda.Would you share the dimensions for the Accords without the sunroof please? I\\'d guess it would be 100 or more.(Just trying to keep this discussion on track).   The interior volume of the Accord without the sunroof is 102.7, according to the brochure I have in front of me. The sunroof steals 5 feet of room (97.7 with sunroof), I guess. It didn\\'t seem like that much when I compared the two models, but I\\'m only 5\\'10\", and so I don\\'t need a whole lot of headroom.  I\\'m 6\\'4\", and have my seat about halfway between the lowest and highest settings, and my head is about an inch and a half from hitting the roof, so it isn\\'t a problem for me. Thegrad2006 EX Cloth, Automatic   The sunroof steals 5 feet of room (97.7 with sunroof), I guess. I don\\'t think the entire 5 feet is for the moonroof. The power seats are also larger, and may account for some of the total.  Interesting how you refer to it as a \\'sunroof\\'. I believe Honda and Acura call it a \\'moonroof\\'. Considering how hot it can be with the sun beaming into the moonroof during the day (especially here in the South), I use mine mostly in the evening.  At what point did it go off track? :confuse: For future reference, you can find all the specs such as interior room on the Accord and all the Hondas here: http://automobiles.honda.com/  keep in mind the 95 Accord a much much lighter and smaller car. The 2.7 V6 weighed a whole 3200 lbs. the 4 banger almost 200 LESS. Goes to show you how far we\\'ve come in 10 years+ and how much larger cars in this class have become. FE (especially in the now 244hp 6) has improved substantially over the old V6, not to mention that the 0-60 time that has lost about 3 seconds. So we can baseline that 9s+ 0-60 and convince ourselves that that must be good because that is what the Accord V6 was able to do 10 years ago, or we can enjoy the added safety of that extra power, and know that that efficiency is not effectively costing much at the gas pumps.  I would not call it an \"advanced timing maneuver\", whatever car you are driving the best way to pass is to do most of the accelerating before going into the oncoming lane.First you say you would not call it an advanced timing maneuver, then you describe exactly what I meant by the phrase. :confuse:I just can\\'t see ever cutting a passing maneuver so close that 0.5 to 1 sec would make a difference.I have never cut a passing maneuver so close with the V6, that I would not have made it with the 4cyl. But it is nice to have that extra margin for error. And yes, the V6 does make a considerable difference, when it comes to passing. Opinions, like mileage, may vary.   Well, after months of ownership and being overall very pleased with the Accord, I have my first complaint. The manual locking mechanisms for each individual door are the pull style, and are located on top of the window sill by the B-pillar. This is right in the way of where I sometimes like to rest my arm/elbow, especially when the windows are down. On my old car, the mechanism was a lever that was built into the side of the door right by the door handle. My solution? I unscrewed the pull itself, and removed it, leaving a small hole where it used to stick up. I\\'ll probably try to find some sort of cap to pop in there. I guess you can say my Honda has now been modified/customized   Back in 96 the V6 Accord was pretty much a wasted effort. It only added 25hp, over the 4cyl VTEC engine, and added (like the captain said) almost 200 lbs because it had a cast iron block, which made it close to a wash, as far as power to weight ratio. The V6 in the current Accord adds about 80 hp, which is more than enough to account for the added weight. The 4cyl has gained 25hp since 96, and the V6 has gained 75hp since then. The V6 Accord has come a long way, in 10 years.  How tall are you? The window sill seems very high, to have your arm resting on it. I guess if it\\'s comfortable for you, it\\'s not too high. However, if you have side airbags, this could be a problem in the event of a crash.  The V6 Accord isn\\'t the only car that has come a long ways in 10 years. The Hyundai Sonata is a prime example.  keep in mind the 95 Accord a much much lighter and smaller car. The 2.7 V6 weighed a whole 3200 lbs. the 4 banger almost 200 LESS.The 1996 Accord 4-cylinder weighs 2,855 pounds, according to ConsumerGuide, with the wagon weighing in at 3,053 pounds.Just some useful info when trying to compare relative weights of these cars.  The Hyundai Sonata is a prime example.Wow, I just read a few of the owner reviews on the 96 Sonata, and I don\\'t think any of them are going to be repeat customers. Not hard to improve on that.  Yeah, but with a brand new customer base getting a lot of car for the money, Hyundai is still rising. You really can\\'t take that away from them. Like the old phrase goes....\"You\\'ve come a long way baby.\" Well, Hyundai has gone from a joke of a company to a company offering solid contenders in MANY classes of car.  It is amazing how far Hyundai has come in 10 years, when some other companies have only taken baby steps. Should I name them? No, I think you all can guess which ones.  No, naming the companies wouldn\\'t be good here. Naming the individual vehicles might be, but if the comments aren\\'t constructive, there\\'s just no point.This convo gets off track and too personal with one little post these days, even posts not intended to start trouble are often taken WAY personally.I think Ford Fusion and Hyundai Sonata should share an award (for last year) for Rookie of the Year, or Most Improved midsize offering from that company.  Another thing I find interesting, is that with such a bad start, the Sonata has retained it\\'s name over the years. It shows that Hyundai knows what is important. Improving the car, is more important than changing the name, to give the illusion of improvement.  Well, maybe they didn\\'t want to follow in Ford\\'s footsteps of renaming its cars every decade.  I knew that posting something positive about a car other than Honda Accord, especially a Hyundai Sonata would push your button. Take a tip from thegrad. He\\'s completely pleased with his Accords and tells us why. He also acknowledges that there are some worthy competitors, including the Sonata. Mainly, he preferred the Accord\\'s interior. Some may like the Accord interior the best, some may not and some may put more importance on a different attribute of the cars.  Please read the post above. I thought it was a complement, to the Sonata anyway. Oh, well.  Well, maybe they didn\\'t want to follow in Ford\\'s footsteps of renaming its cars every decade. As a former ford customer (many, many years ago) I think I know why they do that. I think, its because they allow their cars to become so inferior in quality, style, and reliability that they have too. I, for example, owned two Ford escort. both ran fine till about 70k miles, then were nothing but problems. everything from major engine problems to buttons and knobs breaking, to the most bizzare of all, the catch for the door lock (the metal piece on the frame) actualy rusted (actualy it was the body that rusted) and fell off. I couldn\\'t close the door.But getting back to the point, If ford had kept making them and ever improved the car, it woundn\\'t have mattered. it wouldn\\'t have mattered how many awards that car would have won, or how great the reviews would have been; i would never have bought one again in my life. IMHO, ford (and to some extent GM) have such a reputation for letting their cars go to crap that they have to ditch them and start over.  Re naming like Ford. Are you referring to the latest rename of the Ford 500 to Taurus? Ford thinks the reason the 500 didn\\'t sell well was because nobody recognized or associated with the name. I think it is a very good car, better than the previous Taurus MHO. :blush:  Taurus to Fusion (as the mainstream family car offering)Five Hundred to Taurus (as the full-size upscale offering)Escort to Focus (as the compact offering)Windstar to Freestar (as the minivan offering)These are the first ones that come to mind.  how does the contour fit in there? was it in between escort and focus?  No, the Contour was a larger car than either of those, and filled the gap between the Taurus and Escort (much like the old 90s Altima did between the Maxima and the Sentra). The market for cars like the Contour, Mazda 626, and compact Altima sort of vaporized, along with the name Contour.  I didn\\'t challenge your numbers about the Aura XR being quicker than the new Altima V-6 until I had a chance to get the real numbers. Your statement is not correct, and in fact the Altima waxes your Aura in every category, 0-60, 45-65 passing, and the quarter mile. Information as provided by Consumers Reports. It didn\\'t stop as well, has a smaller interior, much smaller trunk, and was said to have a cheap interior. It was slower in the slalom. I couldn\\'t find any reason other than standard stability control, an option on the Altima that your car was better. It was less expensive by about $1,500. I know you love your car, and I am happy for you, as I said earlier the Aura is a fine car. But it doesn\\'t stack up to the new Altima by the numbers as you suggested. Enjoy your ride!  Taurus to Fusion (as the mainstream family car offering) Five Hundred to Taurus (as the full-size upscale offering) Escort to Focus (as the compact offering) Windstar to Freestar (as the minivan offering)I don\\'t know whether the Taurus was replaced by the Fusion or the 500, but they had to have new names because they overlapped. The Taurus, Fusion, and 500 were all being sold at the same time. There are 2006s and 2007s of all three of them. Same goes for Escort and Focus which overlapped around 2000, IIRC.FWIW, My opinion is the Fusion was the replacement of the Contour and the 500 replaces the Taurus. Just like other manufacturers, each model gets bigger.The Freestar name was perhaps mainly because they were on a (silly) mission to have (almost) all cars names start with \"F\" (with the exception of Mustang).  First you say you would not call it an advanced timing maneuver, then you describe exactly what I meant by the phrase. Just to clarify and not to extend the debate...what I meant was that all I was describing is the proper way to pass.  Carresida - AvalonCorona - vaporizedCelica - vaporizedMR2 - vaporizedCarina - vaporizedStarlet - vaporized210 - vaporzied510 - vaporized610 - vaporizedOriginal BRAND NAME - DATSUN - vaporizedMaybe its not just Ford that does this, eh?Honda can\\'t do this because they aren\\'t original enough to come up with any names, look at what happened when they renamed everything in the Acura line.  keep in mind the 95 Accord a much much lighter and smaller car.So what :confuse: The acceleration times of the V6s of a decade ago are about where the 4 cylinders are today, despite the increased weight.So we can baseline that 9s+ 0-60 and convince ourselves that that must be good No, we can say today\\'s 4 cylinders are surely more than adequate, since the performance figures are about equal to many V6s from about 10 years ago, which are still on the roads today.Still waiting for any evidence (not anecdotes, please) that a V6 improves safety. Statistics? Insurance discounts? IIHS report? ...Anything?  Good work.How about Stanza?Actually Honda has done it, too...Prelude, Passport.  Since when does being the quickest equate to being the best anyway? If we all wanted the quickest then we\\'d all have Mustang GTs. Also high horsepower (say over 260) in a FWD car is not such a good thing considering torque steer. My survey of the Altima vs the Aura puts me in the Altima side of the aisle. Much more confident fit and finish. Let\\'s see how the Aura stacks up with 80,000 miles on it.I get a kick out of how these newcomers get anointed status of being great and the paint isn\\'t even dry on them.  My survey of the Altima vs the Aura puts me in the Altima side of the aisle. Much more confident fit and finish. Let\\'s see how the Aura stacks up with 80,000 miles on it.Relative to a French car being sold by a Japanese company pushing new/not totally proven technology (CVTs)with a Jack Nasser-esqe CEO? I think its pretty close to a toss up.  So, you can\\'t see a passing maneuver that close making a difference? I live in Pa where the state had a program (passion) to remove as many former passing zones on the rural two lane roads as possible a few years ago. In fact this is still ongoing. But, throw in a limited number of legal passing zones with curves, or slight rises at the end of them, motorists who inevitably speed up from 45mph to 60 in a passing zone only to slow back down at the end of it, farm tractors using public roads to get from field to field, coal and garbage hauling trucks getting paid by the load (speeding excessively) believe me any time saved by a quicker pass time (less exposure in the passing lane) is greatly appreciated...  and don\\'t forget the del sol. the difference with ford is, they do it to popular branded names like taurus, escort. even the probe was meant to replace the mustang. You don\\'t see honda getting rid of the accord, or toyota the camry, or nissan the sentra.and I wouldn\\'t realy consider datsun a company. it was just the name nissan marketed their US cars as when they first entered the US. And going by that, there was alsoGeo, plymoth, and oldsmobile  The one problem I have with the saturn line is the the dent resistant body pannels. they achieve that by essentialy making them all out of plastic. If you got into an accident in one it would probaly shatter into a million pices. I deffinitly prefer sheet metal on my fenders and door pannels.and the cvt is neither new nor unproven. Nissan was just the first to start mass producing them for thier vehicles  and don\\'t forget the del sol. the difference with ford is, they do it to popular branded names like taurus, escort. even the probe was meant to replace the mustang. You don\\'t see honda getting rid of the accord, or toyota the camry, or nissan the sentra.That is a valid point, I think it has to do with corporate cultures though. Back in the day, domestic manufacturers used to shift model names and trim levels around annually, as a sign of progress. The Japanese makers seem to hold on to names much longer (the 70s Civic isn\\'t real related to today\\'s Civic, etc).And not all domestic makers do that, you can still buy a Malibu.and I wouldn\\'t realy consider datsun a company. it was just the name nissan marketed their US cars as when they first entered the US.Yeah, thats exactly my point, they changed the name but not much else. They didn\\'t change anything about the company but the name. Kind of like the 500 to Taurus thing.And going by that, there was also Geo, plymoth, and oldsmobileI think retired/out of business names of OEMs are different than names that were changed. Geo turned back into Chevy, so that is similar to the Datsun/Nissan thing, but Plymouth, Oldsmobile, Studebaker, Hudson, etc. went out of business, so that is different.I think there will be another category for the companies that went out of business entirely and the name got bought (MG) or ones that just got bought out (Chrysler). This is probably a discussion for another forum though.  The one problem I have with the Saturn line is the the dent resistant body panels. they achieve that by essentially making them all out of plastic. If you got into an accident in one it would probably shatter into a million pieces. I definitely prefer sheet metal on my fenders and door panels.If you knew the thickness of that sheet metal and aluminum, you would realize that its not providing much in the way of protection. The frame and side-impact door beams are providing the integrity. Also the reason you get door dings and what not is because the sheet metal is so thin.The manufacturing process for the plastic panels is still kind of pricey, I believe even Saturn is going away from that.and the cvt is neither new nor unproven. Nissan was just the first to start mass producing them for thier vehiclesActually, Subaru was, and it didn\\'t go so well. Then Saturn tried and it didn\\'t go so well either. I will give it a while, although honestly, my personal preference is a manual transmission anyway.  Correct the Subaru Justy was a 3 cylinder sub-compact marketed before they were generally accepted due to todays high gas prices. This was 1988 or so. It used a CVT transmission (optional) and had a manual 4 speed standard. I\\'m not sure the transmission itself contributed that much to its ultimate failure however or if it was the overall package...wrong time. It was even available with 4WD and I still see a few around..those that didn\\'t disintegrate due to rust. I test drove one in the day and it wasn\\'t too bad.  It\\'s not about safety. It\\'s just that all that plastic give it a flimsy, kind of cheap feel to it. But don\\'t get the wrong idea, I have nothing against saturn. I just can\\'t get past that \"flimsy\" feel to it.and i believe saturn still uses a CVT it its vue. But it\\'s nothing revolutionary. I think the concept first appeared a long time ago. the actual design is much simpler than a standard automatic transmission. From what I\\'ve read about them, the biggest obstacle was finding a suitable belt that could withstand the torque.  the CVT really pioneered/mass produced by a Scandavian co. called DAF starting back in the late 50s? Used \\'real\\' rubber bands if I recall correctly, in some vey small low HP applications. Also, test drove the new Altima and found it extraordinarily smooth with less torque steer than my wife\\'s 03 V6, if somewhat disconcerting. I guess we\\'ll see how the market accepts them, it does kinda redefine the driving experience - would imagine that some folks won\\'t like it.  a few notes with regards to the CVT - Audi has also used them, and Nissan had been using them for 10 years before they put one in the Murano (the first US offering with the CVT for nissan - which has done very well may i add)CVT\\'s are great for people who get carsick. without the shift shock, people\\'s stomachs dont get upset and people don\\'t get as nauseated. my mom has a murano, and used to never be able to ride in the back seat of a car because she gets sick. not only can she ride in the back seat of the murano, she can read a book while she\\'s sitting back there as well...thats huge progress for someone who gets car sick!just some thoughts -thene  Yeah I think Nissan has the best implementation of a CVT on the market right now. I drove an Altima 2.5 and thought it was very responsive to throttle. If I wanted a CVT I would think about that one.I still can\\'t get the MazdaSpeed6 out of my head. That was the most fun I\\'ve had in a long time. Its biggest drawback is the 93 octane fuel requirement; I\\'m sure they could make it run on 91, but it wouldn\\'t be as fun.  It requires 93? What about the areas where 93 isn\\'t readily available?I always thought cars requiring \"premium\" took 91 octane, like our Odyssey did.  Yeah I think Nissan has the best implementation of a CVT on the market right nowagreed, seems to be the one out there that can \\'put up\\' with the HP and torque of the modern engines. Still have my doubts however about the long term durabilities of 270hp 4 bangers.  when my wife and I traded in our \\'01 Kia Sportage 4X4 in on a 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS. It\\'s funny because I was a staunch supporter of manual tranny\\'s and defended their continued usage in light of the CVT\\'s and paddle-shifters becoming prevalent in newer cars.We test drove a Lancer GTS with CVT and really liked it. It is a smooth manner of transmitting the power to the wheels and the acceleration is smooth and steady. There isn\\'t the lurching that is present in standard automatics as the transmission searches for correct gearing.I noticed last night coming home from the store that deceleration is fast with this tranny...no sooner had I let up on the accelerator I was quietly drifting to a stop outside our driveway. Fuel economy has been around 19mpg city and 31 mpg highway, certainly fair enough for us. We\\'ve been driving Kia\\'s the past 8 years, which are heavy vehicles that don\\'t really get maximum gas mileage but are good, steady vehicles that rarely presented us with any problems.Since the dealership had my color(Rally Red)and the Lancer GTS had the Sun and Sound package(Rockford Fosgate 650-watt 9-speaker stereo system with subwoofer in the trunk and sunroof)already installed I forgot all about needing a 5-speed manual tranny. My wife(who doesn\\'t drive)offered that she would be comfortable driving this car and my son drives but not stick so the car would work for our family as a whole and I buried my 5-speed desires for this car. I may return some day to sticks but the way it\\'s going they may be on their way out. I am one who hopes they stay around.The \\'08 Lancer GTS has aluminum paddle shifters so I can still play if I want. They work great and you can rev up the rpm\\'s as much has you want and then just \"flip\" the paddle in the + direction and the small 4-door sedan responds appropriately. I like the idea and this car and it\\'s transmission are a good fit for us. The Lancer GTS is built tight and there are no shakes, rattles or pops anywhere. I read that people have been unhappy with Mitsubishi\\'s interiors for a while but this one is neat and clean and functionality is smartly appointed in the cabin. Mitsubishi is determined to come back and this new Lancer GTS is a great effort by them in that regard.  It requires 93? What about the areas where 93 isn\\'t readily available?I always thought cars requiring \"premium\" took 91 octane, like our Odyssey did.I would assume it would just retard the timing some, like when you run a 91 car on 89 or 87. Most \"premium\" cars are 91, but Mazda calls out 93 for that bad boy.  The \\'08 Lancer GTS has aluminum paddle shifters so I can still play if I want. They work great and you can rev up the rpm\\'s as much has you want and then just \"flip\" the paddle in the + directionYeah I can\\'t get over my thought that its the goofiest cheesiest thing ever. The whole idea is there are no steps, so why would you add them in? I guess I just don\\'t get it.  pretty sure that you will only find the 93 octane in larger metro areas where the EPA requires ethanol as a \\'clean air\\' additive (down here in Houston, our premium is 93) - but don\\'t fret, the ethanol both pumps the price a bit and costs a little in FE.  Actually, here in Birmingham you have to look hard to find a station WITHOUT 93 Octane, and we use virtually no ethanol.I guess we\\'re an anomoly.  Same in Atlanta. 87, 89, 93.  Which is exactly why I went on to make several more points not speed related as to why the Altima was superior to the Aura. The Aura won\\'t last to 80K miles is my best guess.  The Aura won\\'t last to 80K miles is my best guess. To be constructive, would you mind telling us why?The 3.6L has been around for a few years now, with no major flaws that I\\'ve heard of.With posts like this mindlessly bashing the Aura, the host will likely be back soon. The post about the Altima was good, full of information. It just seems like you are determined to bash the Aura without telling us any \"why\" info. Would you share with us where your 80k mile logic comes in?  the only reason nissan has the best cvt out there is just because they invested more time an money into it than anyone else. same way toyota has the best hybrids on the market, they just worked harder on them. I think most every car company out there has used it on at least one model. Honda had a civic with one, ford used it some in the fiesta. the problme the cvt\\'s had was (as you said) dealing with the greater HP and torque in larger engines. Nissan decided to put more R&D money into solving that than other companies did. And as for the future of 270 hp 4 banger, I think your right. In 15 years I doubt many cars will even have combustion engines in them. Once Lithium Ion batteries are perfected, the combustion engine in a car will only be for recharging the battery.  Once Lithium Ion batteries are perfected, the combustion engine in a car will only be for recharging the battery.And then I will have to modify my car by changing the number of winds on the motor or the armature or the type and size of magnets used...sounds like an R/C car from back in the day.  Actually, if your interested in where that technology is heading, do a google search on the chevy volt. Its quite an amazing car. totaly electric powered with a lithium ion battery and combustion engine to recharge the battery (essentialy coverting gasoline to electical energy like a generator) for trips over 50 miles. Its a sedan that seats 4, has about 140 hp, and under the best conditions will never use gas, and under the worst get 150 mpg.  Its quite an amazing carIt would be even more amazing if it actually worked. Even GM admitted the battery technology required for the Volt doesn\\'t exist.  Is the Volt a midsize sedan? Sounds more like a compact at best, since it claims only to seat 4.The purported second Tesla vehicle (WhiteStar) is to be a mid-size sedan, but it would be very premature to discuss it here.  the battery technology is expected to be availble in a year or two. And even though GM has said the batteries are no t ready yet, they were very carfull to say that it wasn\\'t just a concept car. they fully expect to begin production arround 2009 and even named someone to head prduction. something Gm doesn\\'t do untill they\\'ve decided the car will be produced. And that not just GM. Nissan just recently entered a joint venture with NEC to develop their own Lithium Ion batteries for a similar plug in car with an estimated date of 2010-2011, and toyota is talking about 2009 date for one also. I\\'m not sure where honda stands, but I\\'d be willing to bet they\\'re working on one tool  Its a midsize. when they say seats four, they mean four adults.  here is a pretty good article about it, for those interested.link title  This discussion has turned into a future car http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/direct/view/.ef0d616/or Hybrid http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/direct/view/.ef27a26/discussion. Sounds very similar to topics I have read.You might want to continue it where you can find more, different, and educated opinions.Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t mind it here it is just you might get better participation from one of the other forums.  \"I guess we\\'ll see how the market accepts them, it does kinda redefine the driving experience - would imagine that some folks won\\'t like it.\"It\\'s the VERY reason I bought mine--traded in an \\'04 VW NB TDI 5 Spd. Had always preferred a manual, but loved the smoothness in conjunction with the performance of the 3.5 V-6. We\\'ve gone from two-, three-, four-, five- and even six-speed automatics--STOP! How does one ever get into high gear in everyday stop-and-go driving? Also, the CVT reminds me of the old Buick Dynaflow transmissions of 1948-1963, except without the slip--and especially the ones from 1955-1963 with the switch-pitch variable torque converter. That same device was applied to the 1965-1967 Turbo-Hydramatics in Buicks, Oldses and Cadillacs. When I press the Altima\\'s accelerator past a certain point, it has the jump associated with the Variable Pitch Turbo-Hydramatics.  the smoothness factors you mention are some of the reasons that folks will like it. The sensation of driving the thing is, however, almost like driving backwards, depending on how hard and fast you step on the accelerator the engine will set to a speed, and then, the car seems to \\'catch up\\' as the gears slide seamlessy under you. No more of the rev up to shift point, rev up to shift point etc. etc. - it is different.  I still can\\'t get the MazdaSpeed6 out of my head. That was the most fun I\\'ve had in a long time. Its biggest drawback is the 93 octane fuel requirement; I\\'m sure they could make it run on 91, but it wouldn\\'t be as fun.I also took the MazdaSpeed6 for a ride a couple weeks ago and compared to my v-6 Mazda6, it\\'s quite a bit faster and more balanced b/c of AWD. I had a chance to drive the car along a curvy route that I often take w/ my 6, and the MS6 had much less understeer and accelerated out of corners much better. Seems that the MS6\\'s torque comes in much quicker and it has quite a bit more pull. Also, I think the MS6 comes with stickier rubber, so grip was much better. What a blast! I was actually wondering if I was scaring the salesguy on my test drive... :P I think most of the gas around here is 91, so if that\\'s a step down in power for the MS6, it\\'s still quite good. I was very tempted to do a deal, but then since I bought my car a little more than a year ago, I didn\\'t think it would be very responsible. And when it came down to it, I still love how my car handles when I want to push it a bit. Plus the stopping power in a normal Mazda6 is amazing... I think I remember hearing 60-0 in 120 feet. With the typical inattentive driver out there, this has come in handy a couple times already  But I was very impressed with the mazdaspeed. Even in the dry, like my testdrive was in, the AWD managed power much better than just a front wheel drive car. Granted, my 6 only has 215 HP, but even that can get a bit too much for a fwd car at times. Add in the many days of wet weather we get in the NW, AWD would be that much more valueable.  are there when you want to move through gears to keep your hands busy, that\\'s why we need to have them.I mean, if you\\'ve already downed your cheeseburger, gloppy cherry donut and standard Coca-Cola and you\\'re just plowing ahead in \\'D\", what fun is that?Smoking is not an option so why not magnesium paddle-shift through some + or - Mitsubishi CVT \"graduations\" in your sporty sedan? Makes perfect sense to me!  Its a midsize. when they say seats four, they mean four adults.Okay, usually they claim seating for 5, even in compacts.  The market for cars like the Contour, Mazda 626, and compact Altima sort of vaporizedI guess we are odd balls, not only did I have a contour and like the size of it, but my wife and I each now have cars that kind of staddle that compact/midsize dividing line. A Jetta for her and a Mazda6 for me.  It\\'s the VERY reason I bought mine--traded in an \\'04 VW NB TDI 5 Spd. Had always preferred a manual, but loved the smoothness in conjunction with the performance Its funny, but the altima i bought was the first car I\\'ve had without a stick in about 20 years. Untill I test drove the cvt altima, i had no intention of switching from my reliable stick shifts. But after researching it some, and actually test driving it, i was sold. And I always absolutely hated autos. I even badgered my wife into going down a trim level in her civic to get a stick.  The easy way to drive one of these is to drive it exactly like you would a typical 2-stroke dirtbike. Wring the accelerator and then let up once you get to your desired speed. Driven this way, its fun and quick, though gas mileage obviously suffers some.  are on there way out. Way back when, manuals would give you a good 5MPG advantage over auto transmissions. Today, its not so. Across the board auto manufacturers have built great auto transmissions. The other issue is shifting constantly in traffic. The fact is most people use P, R and D 99 percent of the time..   \"Which is exactly why I went on to make several more points not speed related as to why the Altima was superior to the Aura. The Aura won\\'t last to 80K miles is my best guess\"I too am interested in how you know this? :confuse:  that\\'s funny because that\\'s exactly how it went with me. The added functionality of being able to have my wife drive it and/or my son when he\\'s visiting from the Seattle area sold it to us.And I was driving stick since acquiring my \\'99 Kia Sephia in May of \\'99. I was fully set to only buy sticks for who knows how many umpteen-odd years. The fact that Mitsubishi says we\\'re supposed to get 22mpg city(one better than the 5-speed stick)and 29 mpg highway(same as the stick)only made it all the more a no-brainer. The 2.0L 152hp Mitsu motor carries the new Lancer GTS around quite competently.  I too am interested in how you know this?Me to !!!! I read in the accord thread that GM, cars don\\'t last 50,000 miles so this isn\\'t the first I heard about these type of ridiculous claims. The bottom line is if you are one of those who doesn\\'t consider Buick, a luxury brand in about three years you will wished you had with the 2010\\' Buick Velite Sedan.It\\'s built on the Zeta architecture with 400-450 hp via either a Twin-Turbo, Delphi Direct Injection, \"High Feature\" V6 or the Northstar replacement \"ULTRA V8\" stuffed under the hood with RWD, chrome paddle shifters, and six-gears to flick, Delphi\\'s awesome Magneride system gives you superior handling performance and ride comfort. This car like most buick\\'s we are seeing today have the gadgetology like Acura or Lexus. I know I\\'m talking about the future and the LaCrosse, is the buick model we have to judge now. The Lacrosse, has been updated. It now has a much nicer interior. The LaCrosse \"Super\" get\\'s a LS-4 V8 with 300 hp. and 323lbs of Tq. I believe GM, now has the most powerful FWD midsize auto\\'s on the market. I myself would rather have the Lucerne \"Super\" but would like a chance to drive a LaCrosse \"Super\" this summer. -Rocky  The bottom line is if you are one of those who doesn\\'t consider Buick, a luxury brand in about three years you will wished you had with the 2010\\' Buick Velite Sedan. Eh, I wouldn\\'t say what we\\'re gonna be wishing for. ALL automakers will be advancing just like Buick, and will have come a long way in 2010 I would imagine. I can\\'t picture myself in 2010, at age 22 (assuming I have some $), shopping for a Buick. BMW? Maybe. Acura? Quite possibly. Lexus? ZzZzZz... Buick? Let me get my cardigan and we\\'ll talk.They may be fine cars. I am one who places image WAY down on my list (I drive a 4-door, 4-cylinder Honda; not the coolest of cars), but I can\\'t see myself shopping for a Buick anytime soon, if ever.  Just curious, how come you didn\\'t teach your son to drive a stick? I\\'ve been teaching my 16 year old daughter to drive a stick, and while she was reluctant at first (why shift for yourself if you can have the car do it?), she\\'s gotten quite proficient at it. She still sometimes burns a bit of rubber moving out in first (it\\'s a 4 cylinder 2006 accord), but she just looks over at me and grins.Looking forward to teaching my son in a few years. A chance for some quality father-son time.  I moved some posts here: rockylee, \"Mainstream Large Sedans Comparison\" #2054, 30 Apr 2007 10:31 pm.Let\\'s try to stick to the midsize cars in this topic.

Makes perfect sense to me!So for all this talk that the CVT is so efficient, why would you want to make it inherently inefficient? There are no \"graduations\" its just a belt and two pulleys moving apart. I would be surprised if the car wasn\\'t faster when left on its own than when using the video game controls.That said, if its fun for you and you enjoy it, who cares how inefficient it is :P  I apologize about the Aura 80K miles comment. I was actually just joking. I have no real evidence of it, but admit I\\'ve never been a GM fan. I\\'ve owned 36 cars and only 3 have been GM. I never cared much for styling, or fit and finish. But the Aura is a nice vehicle. Sorry if I offended anybody with my wise crack!  I wondered (too) what you had in mind. I have only owned 1 GM car in the past 45 years and that was a 72 Vega Kamback. It was good for about 20K-miles then I melted the engine when the thermostat froze closed :mad: Anyway I now am the very proud owner of a Aura XR. It is very quick, handles like a sports car (well almost) and gets better mileage than my Cadillac. The fit and finish are the best I have seen in a decade, on an american car.I suggest you revisit GM and especially Saturn. I think you will be surprised at what the New Saturn is doing with there quality control.  cars have certainly gotten better from a durability perspective over the years (as well as more expensive) and it wasn\\'t all that long ago that a car with 50 or 60k on it was deemed \\'worn out\\'.The question I pose for all to comment on is what do we really expect these days to be reasonable repair costs outside of maintainence items such as tires, brakes, batteries, fluid changes, belts/hoses, possibly CV joints etc. My vote will go for 150k with no reliability related failures over a time period of 6-7 years or so. This would be how I personally define a \\'good\\' car. To me, these long term drivetrain or extended warranties mean little because as a rule I haven\\'t had anything of real consequence go wrong within those time/mileage frames for the last several cars I\\'ve purchased new - most of them Altimas. In any case - thoughts - 150k unrealistic? or maybe not too many folks keeping their cars that long?  or maybe not too many folks keeping their cars that long?Not me. New every 3-4 years. My wife too. So we have a new vehicle in the garage every 2 years. Put no money down and trade \\'em in for the payoff on the vehicle (works cause we\\'ve been buying Hondas and Toyotas). Cars are becoming an expensive hobby over here. But worth it.  I expect 100k mile reliability out of any car as a minimum, and I am disappointed if they have major issues prior to the 10yr/150k mark. I maintain vehicles to a very high standard (I wouldn\\'t hesitate to drive my \\'93 across the country), and I don\\'t dink them for piddly stuff, wear items, or things due to abuse or neglect.I have owned or been responsible for both foreign and domestic and all but one (a \"domestic\" vehicle with a Japanese engine) have performed to that level. I have been very happy with the performance, durability and reliability of all the other vehicles.I think I am rare in that I haven\\'t felt super burned by any manufacturer, I feel open to purchasing anything that meets my needs and wants.   New every 3-4 years. My wife toocan\\'t imagine that unless your annual mileage is low, you wouldn\\'t eventually get \\'upside down\\' on you loan amounts eventually (even with Camcords). But a helluva luxury, never even worrying about half of what I would consider \\'normal\\' maintainence. Will you . . . BTW . . . marry me? I do have my eye on that 270hp Altima!   I do have my eye on that 270hp Altima! Me too. Beautiful, awesome car. I like it more than the Maxima. It\\'ll be interesting to see what Honda has up its sleeve for the 08 Accord to combat it, altho 270 hp is pushing it (or should I say pulling it) for a FWD car.  It\\'ll be interesting to see what Honda has up its sleeve for the 08 Accord to combat it, altho 270 hp is pushing it (or should I say pulling it) for a FWD car.Back in the day, the Probe turbo had like 160 and that was pushing it, then the Plymouth Laser had 190, and then the Taurus SHO had 220. Its amazing how they are designing torque steer out of the drive-trains.I think they are starting to look at active differentials to allow more power through the wheels doing the turning and the stopping. Things like the Prelude SH and the Acuras with SH might be one way to cope, and help the outside front tire pull the car through the turn.  Having seen the spy photos of the Accord Coupe, I\\'m gonna go out on a limb and say I like the styling of the 2008 Accord more-so than the Altima, in coupe form anyway. What they do with the rear-end could make or break them.  torque steer and FWD cars is an interesting problem- remember that my old 92 Maxima at 190hp was a handful at times even more so than my wife\\'s 240hp 03 Altima. My personal driver, an Avalon, has no discernable torque steer I think largely eliminated thru transmission and DBW throttle programming (the new TL-S does it this way as well) by simply delaying gear and throttle engagements - but it can be annoying. Other approaches that I\\'ve heard working is lowering the engine in such a way that the halfshaft angles to the wheel centerlines are almost flat. But, in any case, none of this \\'solves\\' weight distribution and understeer issues. Overall, however, for those folks that do have to spend some time on snowy roads, I still believe that FWD is the setup of choice.  How funny, I had a \\'72 Vega as well and I know mine was a hatchback. It had the 2300cc engine, 4 speed on the floor. I promise you the next time I\\'m in Traverse City, I\\'ll go to the Saturn dealer and sit in your Aura XR. The least I can do for my earlier rude comment. I did look at a Hyundai Azera, Wow really nice car. The Ford Fusion didn\\'t do it for me but still nice. Acura TL and Infinity G35 also in the hunt, but another 5 of 6 thousand more for what I wanted.  My folks had a Vega too, but that was mostly before I existed so I didn\\'t count that in my list of cars and durability. I think most people know how that would\\'ve worked out :lemon: Its interesting though, that car was very innovative in that it used aluminum for the block in a mass production car. If they had just finished testing before they started selling it and realized they needed to put steel sleeves in the cylinders, it would\\'ve been fine. That seemed to be a common complaint with domestics in the past, now people are frustrated they are not innovative enough...  my son didn\\'t feel like diving in to learn a stick. I offered to teach him, he got a weird look on his face and declined my offer. I re-offered and he said automatics are fine for him. I told him that he could learn and it was a \"do-able\" thing and I would spend the time but he didn\\'t want to.He has his license still and I\\'m glad he at least wants to drive.I think he\\'ll dig my Lancer GTS a lot and will want to take it for a spin. I am grateful to my Dad for teaching me how to drive a stick. We had a zippy little 4-speed \\'66 VW Fastback that I could drive pert-near whenever I wanted though it remained my parents car. Good for you for teaching your son. I am one who does not want manual tranny\\'s to die off, I\\'m just taking a little diversion from them on this rig. :P  Perhaps learning to drive a stick is critical to really understanding how a car reacts and behaves in certain circumstances, as well as a basic understanding of a car\\'s operational dynamics? That ability, driving a stick, ought to be required for all young drivers, IMO.  the Vega perhaps the beginning of the end of \\'Detroit\\' in the car business - whether it be melting engines in Vegas or exploding gas tanks in Pintos while the Japanese by the mid 70s had really improved their offerings to a point that there really was no contest - a situation that a number of folks would contend still exists today.PS I have always regarded the Corvair, especially in its last few years, as the first (and perhaps only) innovative car that \\'Detroit\\' ever built?  Let\\'s wander on back to the midsize sedans, guys.  Oh I think the domestics had a lot of innovation. I know people who moved households using Chevy Citations. The cargo capacity of those huge hatchbacks was incredible. The Malibu Maxx was kind of the modern day version, but with far better driving dynamics and reliability. The Taurus was unlike anything in its price range in 1986. It had very modern styling, great driving characteristics, and good versatility.Chrysler invented the minivan 3 times. I think that counts as innovation, and they kind of pioneered the modular platform concept in mass production (K-cars and minivans on same platform).Saturn had very innovative body panels, and engines that were designed for the application proved to be robust if not smooth.Thats a few decades of innovation. I think people see what they want to see.  Let\\'s wander on back to the midsize sedans, guys.Sorry, my bad :P  I\\'m gonna go out on a limb and say I like the styling of the 2008 Accord morenow thats a shock :P  The question I pose for all to comment on is what do we really expect these days to be reasonable repair costs outside of maintainence items such as tires, brakes, batteries, fluid changes, belts/hoses, possibly CV joints etc. My vote will go for 150k with no reliability related failures over a time period of 6-7 years or so.I would agree on the time. I would like 6-7 years of minimal problems. We would not get that many miles in so short a time, though. We would only have 50-70K in that time. I can not expect 150K miles beacause that would be 15-20 years. I keep track of maintenance and repair costs. On older cars, most of the time I see $400-800 per year for this. This seems okay to me. When it gets up over $1000 in a year is when I start feeling like the car is having too many problems.  Hehe. I only say \"go out on a limb\" because I haven\\'t seen the sedan version, but assuming it shares the front end with the coupe, I already like it a LOT, and like the fact that it doesn\\'t look like the lights have grown all the way around the car like the Nissan\\'s have.  HUH??? Are you saying you trade a 2 year old Toyota/Honda in for a new one? The dealer makes no profit?  Where\\'d you get that? He said \"it was becoming an expensive hobby.\" It is undoubtedly cheaper to buy new Hondas every two years than new domestic vehicles, based on resale values, but it doesn\\'t mean it is without cost. I\\'m not sure why anyone would try putting words in the mouth of someone who drives a make of car that they didn\\'t like, when they pride themselves on driving something \"different.\" My father drives cars for about 60,000 miles, and by then, he\\'s ready for something new and different. Last time his 2-year old Accord got rear ended though, he bought another JUST like it. Same color. Same powertrain. Same trim-level. I was amazed. He put 69,000 miles on it then couldn\\'t take it anymore and got the car that had his eye since it came out. An Atomic Blue Civic EX Sedan. I wonder what he\\'ll be driving in 2 more years?   I don\\'t put a lot of miles/year on my cars. I had only accumulated 140,000 miles in 12 years. I kept my 92 EX Accord for 12 years because I liked it so much, and it never gave me a problem I couldn\\'t fix myself. The repairs made are 1. Tranny computer $450 2. Fuel pump $200 3. Brake master cylinder (my own fault for not changing the brake fluid) $50 4. Valve cover gasket and o-rings under rocker arms $50. Total cost to me $750. I also did my own maintenance, so the cost was minimal. If my 03 Accord gives me the same type of loyal service, the next car will also be an Accord.  I just hope that the accord coupe addresses the blind spots that are in the current model. That was one thing that I kept me looking at other cars since the 4 door is seen everywhere it seems. And any opinion if they do the 2 tier gauges like the civic? Personally I wouldn\\'t mind, but the huge sea of dash would be a mistake. If they make the suspension a bit more firm, give it better brakes than current models, and give it a good stereo, that would be an amazing car for those of us who enjoy a spirited drive.  They won\\'t have the 2-tier gauges. I\\'ve seen a spy shot on the net with a bit of interior. You can see it here, at the Temple of VTEC website.Looks like the conventional dash to me, although I had no problem getting accustomed to my father\\'s 2007 Civic EX Sedan. Unconventional? Yeah. But it was pretty nice not being \"conventional\" for a change (I drive Accord 4-cyl, 4-doors, so conventional/practical is the norm for me).  The repairs made are 1. Tranny computer $450 2. Fuel pump $200 3. Brake master cylinder (my own fault for not changing the brake fluid) $50 4. Valve cover gasket and o-rings under rocker arms $50. Total cost to me $750.Don\\'t beat yourself up too much, I changed the brake fluid every couple years and I am on my 3rd master cylinder and 3rd clutch slave. I\\'m also on my 3rd distributor and 2nd radiator. I repaired the main relay so it shouldn\\'t fail again. You did great on your parts prices, I couldn\\'t find a master cylinder for less than 3x that($150), and before I isolated the main relay from the fuel pump, the fuel pumps were more like $350 too.  Looks like the conventional dash to me, although I had no problem getting accustomed to my father\\'s 2007 Civic EX Sedan. Unconventional? Yeah. But it was pretty nice not being \"conventional\" for a change (I drive Accord 4-cyl, 4-doors, so conventional/practical is the norm for me).I think its interesting they are so afraid to mess with the Accord in that respect. I would argue they would be better off putting that type of two-tiered cluster in the Accord, since the typical buyer is usually older than a Civic buyer, and it offers real usability advantages for older drivers. Go find one of those early 90s Buicks that still have the big rectangular speedometers and measure the character height, and then check that against the speedo in the double-deck Civic. There are other advantages too but thats a start.  HUH??? Are you saying you trade a 2 year old Toyota/Honda in for a new one? The dealer makes no profit?No - I said I keep each about 4 years, but do it every 2 years. Traded my wife\\'s Camry in on an Odyssey. They gave us what we owed on the car as a trade-in value (was a 5 year loan initially and we put nothing down) and we paid what Edmunds said was the going price for the van.I did the same with an Accord. They gave me what my payoff was for the car (again - had a 5 year loan, no money down initially) and I paid (again) what Edmunds said was the going price of an Acura TL.Both times these cars were legitimately worth what the payoff was on them (or more) which made them both real easy to get out of and into the next vehicle. The dealer wanted my trades. Not many other makes can you get out of them for the payoff in the early years of ownership.This scenario NEVER happened when I traded in the Fords we owned. Especially the Taurus. The dealer didn\\'t want my trade.  That\\'s because the Taurus had huge incentives and huge rental fleet presence which killed resale values.Estimate resale on the Fusion is just under the Accord and just above the Camry. Why? Because they aren\\'t putting huge amounts of cash on the hood and they\\'re not dumping them into rental fleets and the quality is just as good as the competition (or better - so far). If you make regular payments for 4 years on a 5 yr loan with nothing down and you don\\'t have any equity - something\\'s wrong. You\\'d be better off leasing if you know you want a new car every 4 years and you aren\\'t paying them off early.  Don\\'t beat yourself up too much, I changed the brake fluid every couple years and I am on my 3rd master cylinder and 3rd clutch slave. I\\'m also on my 3rd distributor and 2nd radiator. I repaired the main relay so it shouldn\\'t fail again. You did great on your parts prices, I couldn\\'t find a master cylinder for less than 3x that($150), and before I isolated the main relay from the fuel pump, the fuel pumps were more like $350 too.The master cylinder was a rebuilt one from Advance. I actually bought a main relay for it when the fuel pump went out (thinking it was the problem), so when I sold the car, there was an extra one in the trunk. The only part I bought from Honda was the tranny computer, and I could have probably got a good used one for much less. All the parts were probably bought about ten years ago. I think just about everything happened between 100k and 120k miles.  You\\'d be better off leasing if you know you want a new car every 4 years and you aren\\'t paying them off early.Leases are much harder to get out of than owning. I\\'ve done both. Leases handcuff you more.Altho a lease on an 07 Accord should be pretty attractive right now with a MY change looming.  I was just having fun. I\\'ll actually agree with you. the altima coupe didn\\'t impress me all that much. It\\'s a nice enough car and I wouldn\\'t mind having one. But, there\\'s just something about the rear that doesn\\'t look quite right. Kind of looks like they stole some design from the Z, but that doesn\\'t look quite right on that car.As for the sedan, I\\'ll be interested in seeing it. The last few versions of the accord have given me that old man-mid level management feel. It\\'s almost shocking to see someone under 40 driving one. will be real interesting to see what dirrection they go in.  I seem to remember having a CVT on my go cart about 50 years ago. New technology? I wonder.  who ever said it was new technology? Leonardo da Vinci, first came up with the idea of a stepless transmission in the 1400\\'s.  But if you\\'re buying a new car every 4 years like clockwork and you know what you\\'re buying then leasing would most likely be cheaper.  I don\\'t expect any major engine or trans problems for the life of the vehicle. At least, since I started buying japanese cars. My last 4 purchases have been 3 nissan\\'s and a honda. I still have (and are running fine) all but the first nissan i bought in 1992. And I only got rid of that because it was starting to nickel and dime me to death. Engine/trans/body were fine. To me, that\\'s the only downside to the longevity of japanese cars. When up around 12+ years/200k+ miles, because so many parts are still original, a LOT of things start to wear out at the same time. Instead of fixing things here and there, I have no problems at all for what seems like forever, then all of a sudden, everything starts to go.  \"It is undoubtedly cheaper to buy new Hondas every two years than new domestic vehicles\"Oh ya think so huh? When a Honda or Toyota costs about $3,000 - $5,000 more than a like optioned \"domestic\" brand? you had better have higher resale..\"I\\'m not sure why anyone would try putting words in the mouth of someone who drives a make of car that they didn\\'t like, when they pride themselves on driving something \"different.\" Not sure I really understand this one? I wasn\\'t putting words into anyones mouth.. :confuse:  Not sure I really understand this one? I wasn\\'t putting words into anyones mouth.. Saying things like this...HUH??? Are you saying you trade a 2 year old Toyota/Honda in for a new one? The dealer makes no profit? ...when he said nothing of the sort. That\\'s a good attempt to spin what he said. When a Honda or Toyota costs about $3,000 - $5,000 more than a like optioned \"domestic\" brand? you had better have higher resale.. I do. Best-in-class, actually. Thanks for checking though.And I didn\\'t pay $5,000 more for a like-optioned car (and a car isn\\'t just the sum of its parts, but some people don\\'t see it that way).  \"This scenario NEVER happened when I traded in the Fords we owned. Especially the Taurus. The dealer didn\\'t want my trade. \"Typical Ford bashing here.... :sick:  \"This scenario NEVER happened when I traded in the Fords we owned. Especially the Taurus. The dealer didn\\'t want my trade. \" Typical Ford bashing here.... Where\\'s the bashing? He told a fact. If he said \"Fords suck, regardless of the model\" without any facts, THAT would be bashing.He/She is posting his or her experience with the company, just like you did with Honda. They feel they got ripped off by Ford, just like you feel you did with Honda. Where\\'s the difference?  \"Saying things like this... Ever thought maybe I didn\\'t understand what he said?? You may have not paid $5,000 more but you did pay MORE.. trying to make Accord/Camry cost less is like trying to convince people the world is flat. Anyone who shops knows these cars come at a premium price. You felt it necessary to pay extra for a perceived quality/reliability advantage. That is your choice. I did not and after 3 Fords that had no issues with them I will never again. So, stop putting those down who feel it unnecessary to pay extra for nothing...I am enjoying my Fusion SEL v6 loaded with every option. It is getting me 24MPG and the trend is upward for MPG. No rattles, no problems, no issues at about 14,300 miles runs great, drives great. I also enjoy knowing I paid no interest on my loan and the car will be paid for in about 2 years.  Why does this bother you so much that a Ford product can perform?  Why does this bother you so much that a Ford product can perform? The Ford product CAN perform, I\\'ve backed you up on that all along. Why do you say things like this when I\\'ve praised the Fusion REPEATEDLY on this forum?I haven\\'t been putting anyone down, but statements saying I\\'m paying extra for nothing are purely idiotic. Who said I bought something other than Ford for reliability reasons? You. ONLY you. Why would you suggest that?You don\\'t drive a Honda, and have CLEARLY stated you NEVER will, so I don\\'t take ANY of the price info (or lately, any other info) you post seriously at all due to clear anti-Honda bias that you are attempting to bash our heads with (much like that darn media you always mention in a comparison of car models). I bought the Honda because I liked the torquier 4-cyl coupled with the better mileage, as well as the interior design which I felt completely outclassed the compeitition. Why does it bother you that someone chose a Honda, when you pride yourself on driving something different?The Fusion is likely the best-kept secret that the American companies have. It is certainly better than 80% of the competition. It just didn\\'t offer what I wanted. WHY IS THAT SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND? WHY, IF I CHOSE HONDA, MUST I BE ACCUSED OF HATING FORD?Since we\\'re giving praise reports, I\\'ll have had my car 18 months next week, with 18,600 miles on it. I get close to 40 MPG on most trips, an average right at 30 MPG on my commute into Birmingham. My friends always want to take my car because it is so good on gas and a nice ride, while I know how much fun it really is to drive on the twisties when I push the car harder. I got the car for $21,200, which is $2,600 under sticker. The Fusion\\'s TMV, equipped with the options of my Accord (but without a design that I found desirable) was $19,623. That\\'s a difference of $1,587. For that $1,587, I got best-in-class resale value, a torquier engine, an interior that I desired more, better fuel economy, and a dealership DOWN THE STREET (something that is just dumb luck and really didn\\'t matter at buy-time).  Typical Ford bashing here.... Bro I\\'ll bash any car I own that was a miserable piece of dung. Even the dealer passed on it. Soured me towards Ford for a long time.  It\\'s not the metal trim that makes me really like this interior, it is the design. If the quality of the plastics is solid, and the tactile quality of the switchgear is close to my Honda\\'s (which I found to be the best, others may not), I\\'d say it is a real contender in the interior department! Compared to the boxy, blocky Fusion, the Mondeo looks like the model the Fusion should have been, in my eyes. Some like the boxes, the stereo that\\'s in many other Ford products, and the climate controls that are in many other models as well. I just like things to be unique to my car. Ford made the Mondeo look really nice!  Yes, but the Mondeo starts at about $27K in Europe. That would be DOA, if Ford came out with a midsize sedan at that price here.I don\\'t know what the size of Mondeo is but I would not be surprised if it would be called \"too small\" here, like the Contour and the Mazda6.  Looks like this car also suffers from Ford\\'s D - L shifter. Is there even an OD off control?  Yes, but the Mondeo starts at about $27K in Europe. That would be DOA, if Ford came out with a midsize sedan at that price here. I agree with you, but the interior in the Mondeo has the kind of style I wish the Fusion offered, which for a $20k+/-, I think it should.  Bro I\\'ll bash any car I own that was a miserable piece of dung. Even the dealer passed on it. Soured me towards Ford for a long time. I feel similarly. While my 2004 Ford was not \"a miserable piece of dung\" it sure didn\\'t give me many reasons to buy another Ford. It drove very well, had an excellent design, was very comfortable, and was tough. However, the interior materials were very cheap, it had miserable resale value and was in and out of the shop since day one, at least a dozen times... and some of the issues were never fixed. The dealerships could never fix it, I just had to live with the issues. It kept up with the odd noises and dashboard warning lights after the warranty expired, so... I cut it loose and bought a vehicle with one of the highest reputations for quality and reliability.  Looks like this car also suffers from Ford\\'s D - L shifter.I agree. The Fusion I\\'ve been driving didn\\'t have the ability to shift thru the gears like I want. Kinda silly that Ford\\'s entry to compete against the CamCords doesn\\'t have this basic offering. I love second gear in bumper to bumper crawling. The slight braking and easy acceleration combination takes the constant riding the brake out of the picture some, making tough traffic on the highway easier to deal with. And the Fusion didn\\'t have this. Sad.  the battery technology is expected to be availble in a year or two.I think we\\'ve been hearing that since 1903...    no issues at about 14,300 miles runs great, drives great. wait till you have about 75,000 on it.  actualy, the batteries exist now. They just have a few issues to work out. mostly the price, they run about 10,000. on top of that, they need to make sure they will be able to be recharged a certain number of times, and something about being able to function if an individual cell dies. I actualy dread the day theese things become a reality, but every auto company out there is developing one.  They also have some thermal issues to work out. The batteries get very hot when they recharge and they don\\'t like to discharge when its cold out. This si why the EV-1 was only available in warm places. The efficiency of batteries goes down with temp (the CA crusing range of the EV-1 was like 100 miles, the NY crusing range was like 14 miles)They will get there. And maybe some folks will buy these and save fuel and what not so we can drive the fun cars that are left.  Not specifically to your post, but where does the electric energy come from? We hear all the talk about clean electricity. How is the electricity produced; buring coal, oil, natural gas or Heaven forbid :P nuclear?What is the energy effiency? Years ago, a friend of mine (38 years older than me) who is a retired plumber advised us to replace our worn out gas clothes dryer with a new gas clothes dryer (even though gas dryers are more expensive then electric dryers) because the gas transmission line is more effecient than electric lines (with their power loss through the electric lines). We\\'ve followed his advice for two replacement dryers.I don\\'t pretend to know about all that stuff, but it seems logical to me. A direct pipeline to our dryer vs \"some\" energy source to an electric generator and then transmitted via power lines (with a loss of energy along the way) to reach an electric dryer. Unless the electricity produced is greater than the energy required to produce it and/or unless the machine consuming the energy consumes electricity more efficiently than an alternate direct fuel source, then bateries will be more expensive to operate (never mind replacing them at some point).  actualy, the batteries exist now. They just have a few issues to work out.Like I said, since 1903...  Bro I\\'ll bash any car I own that was a miserable piece of dung. Even the dealer passed on it. Soured me towards Ford for a long time. Personally, I don\\'t think having a bad experience with a product will make me exclude that brand in the future. It all comes down to how a current product is being judged. I had a bad subaru that was in for service far too often and cost me far too much. But would I buy another one? You bet. I had a bad panasonic DVD player. Would I buy another one? Yeah, actually, I now have two of them. Reason being, I know the track record now is pretty good for both brands. We\\'re in an age of information and I choose to take advantage of it rather than use a narrow view of personal experience and second hand stories. And knowing that most car manufacturer\\'s quality is now very good according to multiple sources (jd powers and cr), I felt comfortable choosing based on other priorities. I wanted something fun to drive, had good hauling capabilities, something that I liked to look at, was a good value in up front costs, and was safe to drive. The people I\\'ve known that owned Mazda cars have had good experiences with them and more importantly had a passion for them that most other car owners have not had. I understand why now that I own one. I\\'m glad I did not limit my choices because one brand had a fraction of a percent higher reliability rating over a five year period. Otherwise I\\'d probably be driving a *YAWN* camry or corolla now. Scary thought...  Unless the electricity produced is greater than the energy required to produce it and/or unless the machine consuming the energy consumes electricity more efficiently than an alternate direct fuel source, then bateries will be more expensive to operate (never mind replacing them at some point).What I\\'ve often wondered about is, why is steam not a viable option? I know the main fuel comsumption would be to heat it, but today aren\\'t there ways to heat water efficiently? At least with much less fuel than would be burned by even a small gasoline engine. Of course, the safety issue would have to be addressed, but again with today\\'s materials, I don\\'t see why that couldn\\'t work in conjunction with a nice pop-off valve. I expect there\\'d have to be a way to get a quick head of steam on a 15 degree day, too. The things have massive torque from dead stop and wouldn\\'t require a transmission. I\\'m sure it\\'s been discarded for very good reasons, \\'tho. It never did exist again after the 20s. I remember seeing a Stanley in operation at one of our Rambles back in the 70s--that thing would huff and puff up the hills in Cameron Park like there was nothing there when the other old cars were gasping in low gear...  Boxy blocky?? so the Honda has no square buttons, nor the the Camry??  \"wait till you have about 75,000 on it. \"It is the same old mundane comments like these that are typical of the Honda/Toyota brethren. What you don\\'t seem to understand is I have had Ford products that went up to 150,000 with no issues, others that went 110,000 another that went 75,000 and another that went about 90,000. Try to convince me that Fords are all garbage.. yeah right..   Bro I\\'ll bash any car I own that was a miserable piece of dung. Even the dealer passed on it. Soured me towards Ford for a long time. \"Bro, I guess I\\'ll bash my 2000 Accord then??   I believe you already have. Several times. Your previous posts give me a chance to make a couple of points to everyone. I will use your words for examples, but nearly everyone here needs to listen.It\\'s really not useful to make sweeping generalizations such as \"typical of Honda/Toyota brethren\" - let\\'s have conversations with each other as individuals instead of painting large groups of people with one brush. It\\'s not only not helpful, but it cannot be correct.As for the square buttons comment, no statement was made whether or not Honda and Toyota have them. It\\'s dangerous to react to assumptions. That\\'s when things start to get out of hand.Why don\\'t we ALL try to have some new conversation instead of just saying the same things over and over again?  We hear all the talk about clean electricity. How is the electricity produced; buring coal, oil, natural gas or Heaven forbid nuclear? What is the energy effiency?Even coal can be pretty clean (leaving aside the carbon dioxide issue, nuclear solves that one :surprise: ). The reason being, it is a lot more cost effective to control emissions from one gigantic source rather than millions of tiny ones.It seems crazy that burning coal to boil water, to run steam turbines, to generate electricity, that is than sent through miles and miles of wires can be more efficient than an internal combustion engine, but I believe Tesla motors has some papers that show that this is the case. Some time time ago I did a calculation myself...looked at the equivalent mpg based on what the electricty would cost and the price of gasoline. At the time, I came up with their electric car being equivalent to getting about 100-300 mpg. Of course, this answer depends on what you pay for electricty and gasoline and whether you remove the taxes from the price of the gasoline.  Man I feel like the Iluvsephia guy, I can\\'t get this car out of my head. I am a little concerned about buying a car that needs 93 octane gas and gets mpg in the 20s when gas is going over $3/gallon, but I don\\'t drive that much and I might as well enjoy it when I do.It has the wholesome attributes of the Mazda6 (4 doors, good trunk, rear seat room for kids, etc) plus 270hp and AWD. The clutch like a switch but I think I could get used to that...the clutch in the Accord was never a champ either.It has been a very long time since I have actually gotten to pick out a vehicle for myself, usually I scoop up hand-me-downs or things people were going to trade-in, and its very likely I won\\'t get to pick out anything for myself for a long time to come.  You mention roominess. One of the deal-breakers for me on the Speed6, besides the higher projected long-term operating costs (premium gas, maintenance on the turbos and AWD system, etc) and much higher insurance costs, was the lack of a folding rear seat. I think it did have a pass-through for skis, but unless you ski you are out of luck on easily carrying larger items. Just something to think about, I didn\\'t realize that until I had almost made my mind up.  I thin the big one is the insurance/fuel cost. Turbos don\\'t require a whole lot extra at this point. I would be surprised if the car didn\\'t call for synthetic oil, but that is about the only turbo related expense likely in my ownership.was the lack of a folding rear seatYeah, that was an issue for me too until the sales guy showed me that it does still have a folding seat. There is a trim piece that can me removed to provide access to the seat folding mechanism from the regular Mazda6. The cross-brace is still there but I am pretty sure what I need will fit around it.I think the bikes will be on the roof, so I am not worried about that, and the other car is the family truckster, so this one need not have the same level of utility.  I wonder if the turbo/high performance will decrease reliability? In most cases, high performance models have lower reliability. Don\\'t see much information about the Speed6.  I wonder if the turbo/high performance will decrease reliability? In most cases, high performance models have lower reliability. Don\\'t see much information about the Speed6.I guess I could see that with respect to the drivetrain, instead of 2 axles to need boots there are 4 to tear and rip and wear out, it has 18\" wheels so tires will be pricey, etc. The motor itself I am not too worried about, the 2.3 has been well proven, and I don\\'t see myself cranking the boost or doing a lot of modifications to the car.Mazda has been doing Turbos for a long time, as has Mitsubishi (the Eclipse/Talon/Laser/Galant/Lancer turbos did well)and Subaru. Now even Acura and BMW are doing it on gasoline engines. I am not too worried about that part.  And knowing that most car manufacturer\\'s quality is now very good according to multiple sources (jd powers and cr), I felt comfortable choosing based on other priorities. I wanted something fun to drive, had good hauling capabilities, something that I liked to look at, was a good value in up front costs, and was safe to drive. I agree 100% with that. I think anyone who is buying one of the vehicles on this thread based solely on quality or reliability ratings is crazy. That\\'s right, crazy. :P I understand some manufacturers had issues in the past with quality and reliability but times have changed and they changed fast. Any of these sedans are worthy of one\\'s hard earned dollars and I don\\'t feel any of them will let anyone down. If I were in the market for one I\\'d have no problem buying the one I liked best based on style and a good old fashioned road test and I feel anyone who\\'s not tied a need for high resale (That does still vary and probably will for a little while longer), high fuel mileage, or low cost should do the same. There are fairly obvious choices to suit those needs in this comparison and I understand that people like that do exist. But we, as enthusiasts, need to be a little more open, right?   I think everyone buys a vehicle based on performance...the issue is different people define performance differently. Some feel the two bold numbers on the window sticker are the best measure of performance (MPG) others like red dots in a consumer publication, and still others like a bunch of stars next to various types of impacts. Still others like the number of horses under the hood, the feeling on a curve, or amount of headroom under the roof. I know there are other factors too but I am running out of prose.I think in reality it is a balance of these things. That balance is different for each individual.  Right on the mark.  I thin the big one is the insurance/fuel costReally? Premium fuel is .20 a gallon more. So a 15 gallon fill-up costs you $3 more than regular. 5 fill-ups a month is $15. Is that a big cost?  And it should be noted that premium is always $0.20 per gallon more regardless of whether regular is $3/gallon or $1.50/gallon. So the relative cost difference between regular and premium is the same, but every time the cost of fuel goes up you hear folks complaining about having to buy premium.  Really? Premium fuel is .20 a gallon more. So a 15 gallon fill-up costs you $3 more than regular. 5 fill-ups a month is $15. Is that a big cost?I think in my mind that was co-mingled with going from a car that easily gets 30 mpg to one that struggles to get 25, more realistically 20 mpg. That premium fuel thing is one of my beefs with the VQ35, too. It seems like the other V6s don\\'t need premium (Honda, Mazda, Toyota).I think the likelihood is relatively high I will wuss out and try to find a Mazda6 V6 5spd :sick: (especially since they have been around for a while, so finding a used model is easier), but I really liked the ride and driving feel of the Speed6.  I think previous experience with a brand or model, are large factors when anyone buys their next car. If you are completely satisfied with your current car, you are likely to go back to it in the future. So the cars with the most satisfied customers, are logically the cars with the most repeat buyers. Of course, if your needs or wants change (family grows etc.), so can the choice.Some people are influenced by trends (SUV craze). Others do not care what \"everyone else\" is driving. I\\'ve never needed an SUV, so I\\'ve never owned one. I\\'ve always seen SUVs as wagons that ride like trucks (not what I want).  If you are considering the Mazdaspeed 6 and might need a little more room, then the Accord V-6 6M might be worth a look.Handling won\\'t be as sharp (still pretty good though), but it has a lot more room and folding seats. Its also just about as quick and gets very good gas mileage. Some people are getting high 30\\'s on the highway at moderate speeds, as it has a very tall 6th gear.  Of course, this answer depends on what you pay for electricity and gasoline and whether you remove the taxes from the price of the gasoline. LOLTaxes is probably the stopper. Here in CT the state doesn\\'t wack us hard enough with a $0.45 tax per gallon so they also have a gross earnings tax applied at the wholesale level. It\\'s currently 6.3% and increasing to 7% on July 1. The gas station I normally go to is currently charging $3.159 per gallon. If the station is making $0.15 per gallon, the wholesale price is $2.55 and 7% of that is $0.178 per gallon. Then the feds charge $0.184 per gallon. $0.812 of that $3.159 is tax. Keep that in mind the next time you hear some politician attacking \"Big Oil\" and the high price of gasoline.  If you are considering the Mazdaspeed 6 and might need a little more room, then the Accord V-6 6M might be worth a look.Handling won\\'t be as sharp (still pretty good though), but it has a lot more room and folding seats. Its also just about as quick and gets very good gas mileage. Some people are getting high 30\\'s on the highway at moderate speeds, as it has a very tall 6th gear.I think that is a good thought but I actually don\\'t need more room, I don\\'t even need that much room. I drove the 4 cyl Accord and found it competent but far from sporting (although power was fine). I think the Mazda6 V6 is more comparable to the Accord V6, and its several thousand dollars cheaper. I was also looking at used vehicles, so Honda\\'s resale value doesn\\'t appeal to me.  I think the Mazda6 V6 is more comparable to the Accord V6The only thing comparable is that they\\'re both 6 cylinders.  That premium fuel thing is one of my beefs with the VQ35unless Nissan has changed their owner\\'s manual that says \\' for maximum performance 91 octane fuel is recommended\\', haven\\'t found this to be the case - my wife\\'s VQ35 (in an Altima) has been running just fine now for about 80000 trouble free miles - on regular.  Making less than advertised figures (hp/tq) in the process though.Some can\\'t feel the difference. I never could tell in our Odyssey van (the drop was from 210 hp to 205, and from 229 lb-ft to 221lb-ft, I think). Not noticeable. For those touting their car getting 270 hp, well, if they aren\\'t putting premium in it, they are not getting 270 hp. The computer is retarding the spark for the lower octane gas.  Yeah, and if they are not running it at 6000 rpm, they are not getting 270 HP, even with premium.  Fords arn\\'t garbage, butyou often ask why pay the premium for a japaneese car. There are several reason, but thats a big one. I have 110,000 miles on a honda, and i haven\\'t even had to change brakes yet. my 145,000 nissan has had the front brakes replaced once. and thats it. Total repair bills for my 5 year old honda: $0.00. Total repair bills for my 9 year old nissan: $230.There is a reason ford\\'s drop in value so much, so fast. the likelyhood that you\\'ll only get 70% of the miles out of it than you would a forign make is a huge part of it.  For those touting their car getting 270 hp, well, if they aren\\'t putting premium in it, they are not getting 270 hp.of course not, and no big deal - for those cars that can effectively use the extra octane, though, it is a helluva nice option to have. My personal driver, a Toyota 2GR, is much the same way as my wife\\'s VQ35, I tend to put premium in my car  , she is happy running hers on regular  . The power drop-off, BTW, I\\'m guessing is no more than about 10HP or so.  front pads lasting over 100,000 miles??? while I\\'ve had similar experiences with my last 4 Nissans, I can\\'t claim that one! Either most of those miles are on the highway, or you just don\\'t use your brakes?  And maybe some folks will buy these and save fuel and what not so we can drive the fun cars that are left. Hopefully. the whole idea of it (to anybody likes cars and doesn\\'t just view them as transportation) is sickening. but this is still 10-15 years away. they\\'ll probably show up sooner than that, but not on a large scale. I figure 20 years or so from now (for obvious reasons) the gasoline powered car will be forced out.when I first read about the volt, thought it was just something GM was doing that would never work. But when I read up on it more, and saw that toyota and honda were also working hard on it, and nissan went as far as creating a joint company with NEC to design make and sell theese batteries I realized it was for real.  thats on the honda. My nissan only made it to 79,000 on the front. The honda is driven probably a 60-40 mix highway-city. I think it was january when i had it inspected last (required every 12 months in virginia)and I couldn\\'t believe it when the passed. I actually questioned my regular mechanic about it afraid he was just letting them slide to do me a favor.and i mention this begrudgingly, as I\\'m a nissan man myself. :P My wife drives the honda.  i don\\'t view brakes as repair, but maintenance. unless something is not working correctly. if you have a long commute brakes will probably last longer that someone with a short commute.  Brakes are a function of the driver in part too - far too many people brake at the last moment and go right from gas to brake. Just let it coast early (why rush to a red light?) and you\\'ll need far less brake to stop the car. :P  I think previous experience with a brand or model, are large factors when anyone buys their next car. If you are completely satisfied with your current car, you are likely to go back to it in the future.I know a lot of people who are brand loyal, and if that makes them happy, great. Personally, I love how good companies adjust to the marketplace and make improvements. Whenever a new model comes out, you never know how they will change. And perhaps my own needs and wants will change too. Sometimes the changes that a manufacturer makes will mirror the new needs of a given customer, but sometimes not. When I was buying a car this time around, I wanted something that could haul a lot but also something that handled well. That eliminated suv\\'s and trucks and knocked half the cars listed above off the list. I geuss the Accord stayed on my list since I had good luck with it in the past and it did handle pretty good. But in the end, brand had very little impact on what I bought and I\\'m glad. Having many good cars to choose from makes us all very lucky no matter what our balance of priorities are.  Honda Brakes.........Recently I traded off my \\'96 Honda Accord LX 4cyl auto. At 165,000 miles on it the original brakes had at least 50% life left in them. Only repair items were a brake master cylinder and a new radiator (not counting a new muffler and exhaust pipe-spark plugs-other regular maintenance items). I always changed the oil regularly with Mobil 1, the trans fluid (again Mobil 1 tranny fluid) and Bosch Platinum spark plugs at 30k. This was one great car! Gas mileage was always 30 mpg+. I hope my new \\'07 Accord SE will do as well in the years ahead.Always anticipate your stops and the brakes will last a lot longer. \"We are standing on Giants\".  My Integra front pads lasted over 160,000 miles. Lots of highway and slow city.Nice big discs on a nice light car, they never have to strain, don\\'t get hot and last. Rear disc pads only lasted 95,000 though. They cheaped out on those.   \"There is a reason ford\\'s drop in value so much, so fast. the likelyhood that you\\'ll only get 70% of the miles out of it than you would a forign make is a huge part of it.\"Yet another generalization the host spoke of.. right host??All my Fords lasted and if you get out on the net you will see plenty of high mileage Fords/Chevrolets with happy owners. Honda/Toyota have a PAST reputation for high mileage vehicles..   All my Fords lasted and if you get out on the net you will see plenty of high mileage Fords/Chevrolets with happy owners. Honda/Toyota have a PAST reputation for high mileage vehicles.. While I don\\'t agree with the post you were replying to (it is exactly as you say, one of the sweeping generalizations about car makes), the one saying Ford\\'s likelihood of reaching high miles vs. others\\' etc.., I am a CURRENT example of high-mileage Honda-owner, and wonder how you intend to back up your statement. I like to think I have moderate-mileage, with 172,500 miles as of yesterday on my Accord.  Yet another generalization the host spoke ofno, personal experience. But for every ford you can find with 200,000 miles on it, I\\'ll find you a toyota with 300,000 on it. But your right, it is a generaliztion. I\\'ll give you that. But since you are standing firm on the notion that a ford is built as well as a japanese car, perhaps you\\'d care to explain why a ford, after 3 years, is only worth 1/3 of what you paid for it?here is a list of the 10 worst cars for holding their value. 9 of them are domestic, and 3 are fords. can you explain this?link title  There is a very interesting book called \"The Reckoning\" that cronicles the rise of Nissan, and fall of the big 3 from the 50\\'s to the 70\\'s. A must read for those arguing the domestic vs foreign quality issue. To sum it up the Japanese had to make their cars better every year because they were so bad to begin with (they celebrated when they finally could keep up with a VW bug). The Americans, meanwhile, were so far ahead that their biggest concern was saving money on each piece that went into the vehicle, so they could maximize profits.Completly different cultures. One funny part was the Japanese wondering why their cars did not start in the U.S. when they would in similar cold climates in Northern Japan. It turns out the Japanese all covered their cars at night with blankets, and they figured the Americans did the same.As far as the current battle for the midsize sedans, it is getting hard to tell where the cars are made, and where the profits are going. I will say that cheaping out is not the way to go. I briefly looked at a Focus (despite having a Taurus that was not good to me) because of the excellent handling and the availability of a wagon. Everything just felt off. The seats were so soft like they had no springs, and the gauge cluster looked cheaper than the speedo I had on my Schwin. It seems to me the domestics are close in many ways, but they are often trying to cut corners in areas they think people won\\'t notice. They do notice.One thing I do like about the domestics and about the Focus was the ability to order the exact vehicle you want (or close to it). They should push that angle.  \"here is a list of the 10 worst cars for holding their value. 9 of them are domestic, and 3 are fords. can you explain this?\"I\\'d say there are several factors that can, alone or in combination, cause low resale value. 1) Perceived quality difference. I believe there is still, in general, a quality/reliability advantage that some makes have over others. (I believe it is mostly smaller than it used to be, and smaller then most people\\'s perceptions, but those perceptions are what matter.)2) Heavy used supply from fleets. Some makes/models are heavily owned/used in fleets. Fleets\\' generally short retention means quick turnover and more used availability of those makes/models. (PS: Food for thought... Despite the lower resale value numbers, you wanna bet that those fleet models STILL offer lower overall lifecycle costs for the owners? Companies are obsessive about the bottom line; you can be certain that if it made fiscal sense for them to own/operate some other make in their fleets, they would be doing so.)3) The calculation itself is non-representative and inexact, at best. Those quoted percentages are all figured based on MSRP, not what you or anyone else actually paid for a vehicle. Makes that have more slop/incentives/rebates built into the sticker will show misleadingly low resale value figures. Caravan SE is on the list, for example. The first one I find on Fitzmall\\'s site shows an MSRP of $19975, but can be bought for a no-haggle $15623. In this case, the resale calculation is done using an MSRP that is over 27% more than what I actually paid. So yeah, it\\'s gonna look ugly calculated that way. But I didn\\'t \\'lose\\' that $4k+ -- I never spent it in the first place.  #3 is a big one. Any depreciation comparison that is based on MSRP is completely useless. Cars.com should be ashamed of themselves for putting that out as if it means anything to anyone. Mostly it is just a list of cars that sell with the biggest discounts from MSRP.I bought my $21,000 Mazda6 for $16,000...if it is worth $16,000 in a year, that site will claim 30% depreciation when reality would be 0%.   At 165,000 miles on it the original brakes had at least 50% life left in them. Wow, 144k and its halfway though its 3rd set, and this last time it needed new rotors, which is a major ordeal. I\\'m not complaining about brakes every 50k, just wondering how other people can go so long.Only repair items were a brake master cylinder and a new radiator As the family AAA tow record holder, it has also needed those things as well as 3 distributors, a starter, an ignition switch, and of course a main relay. Most recently, it pushed out its cam seals, making a big oily mess, but I cant really count that as the car is 15 years old and has 140k.I always changed the oil regularly with Mobil 1, the trans fluid (again Mobil 1 tranny fluid) and Bosch Platinum spark plugs at 30k.I have always changed the oil but not used Mobil 1 with that vehicle. Piston rings, oil seals, etc are fine, I don\\'t expect a mechanical problem from the engine in that car. I also have had bad luck with the Bosch plugs (in that car and others). The Accord seems to like the NGK plugs called out for it, and even the Contour (which was on a hook once, for a water pump, at 130k) liked the Motorcraft/Autolite plugs the manual specified better than the Bosch ones.   just wondering how other people can go so long. a big part is what brakes you put on it. when the original brakes the car came with wear out, you have to be real carful which aftermarket brakes you put on it. The quality of the origianals is much higher than what you find in an autoparts store. Those are driven more by price than anything else. But 50k for brakes isn\\'t bad.  There is nothing in that list that is on topic here. Let\\'s stick to the midsize sedans, please.  The decision to buy our 2007 SEL AWD V6 6-speed automatic Fusion was heavily influenced by professional reviews and ratings.With its $27,105 MSRP we could have bought an Accord or Camry, for example, but the ultimate deciding factors were style (looks), handling and features.Five months and 3,000 miles later we are still pleased with our purchase EXCEPT for the horrific 14.8 miles per gallon in-city mileage. The revised EPA rating for this drive train is 17 mpg city, 24 mpg highway. Unfortunately, 95 percent of our driving is in-city, stop-and-go, short hops.Naturally we hope that the Fusion will be as reliable as the Accord and Camry have proven to be. Only time will tell if Ford\\'s new entry into the midsize market will prove to be a better idea. Our own personal experience with other Ford products has been generally favorable and we did not want a plain Jane-looking product.The Asian cars, in general, have a certain sameness to them while the Fusion is definitely bold and distinctive. It stands out in a crowd. Pride of ownership is a factor with any automobile. The fit and finish of our Fusion is exceptional and the car has many features only found on autos costing thousands of dollars more.Another factor was the dealer. Our previous experiences with Sherwood Ford, Lincoln, Mercury in Salisbury, Md., were A1. Having a good dealer means a lot in the long run.To be sure, the midsize sedan market is one of the most competitive these days and there are good things about each manufacturer\\'s entry but the Fusion was the best choice for our tastes. Now, if the in-city mileage would improve to the revised EPA estimate, we would be totally satisfied.Boz  I could say almost exactly the same thing for why I bought a Saturn Aura. It\\'s great looks, room inside and trunk (plus fold down seats) tons of really cool (and hot) features like red LEDs ambient lighting and heated front seats.Fortunately after 7000 miles we are getting over 19 city (when I drive carefully, less when I am having fun) and 27+ highway.Love the car, handling and performance more than the other features.Glad to hear you love your Fusion for the same reasons I love my Aura.  There is nothing in that list that is on topic here. Let\\'s stick to the midsize sedans, please.Please excuse me pat Host. I thought the Honda Accord was a midsize sedan. My \"list\" in regards to my midsize Accord was only meant to be informative about their durability as a midsize entry compared to others in this class. :blush:  \"Glad to hear you love your Fusion for the same reasons I love my Aura.\"We definitely live in a \"difference stokes for different folks\" kind of a world. Didn\\'t the Aura win some organization\\'s \"Car of the Year\" award? I seem to recall a TV ad to that effect. We envy your miles per gallon results. In retrospect, I wish we had ordered an I4 with either a manual or automatic. The V6 with AWD combo is a real mileage killer in town driving  But then, you didn\\'t buy the Fusion for its fuel economy, did you? If you were looking for a mid-sized car with optimal fuel economy in stop-and-go city driving, maybe the Camry Hybrid (or Prius, if big enough) would have been the best choice for you.  An even worse one is the Grand Marquis.$25K MSRP. $17K end of year sale($18K right now, without end-of-year anything).So it depreciates in two years to 14K. Looks dreadful on paper. Actually, it\\'s 1.5K a year, or about what an Accord does, percentage-wise.  But then, you didn\\'t buy the Fusion for its fuel economy, did you?Your are correct Backy. However, I foolishly thought it might actually deliver the original EPA estimate of 19 city (since revised downward by the EPA to 17 mpg city). For the first 2,000 miles the car was stuck at 13 mpg but it has improved to 14.8.I didn\\'t think a 4 cylinder would be powerful enough for a 3,200 midsize car but now believe I could have been mistaken, that we really don\\'t need a V6 for the kind of driving that we mostly do.Hindsight is always 20-20. The EPA estimates for midsize V6s are pretty close together, I believe, within 1 to 3 mpg of each other.We consider our Fusion to be a great value as a midsize sedan, EXCEPT for the mileage. I expect we will have the car for seven to 10 years. We also have a 1997 V6 3.8-liter Thunderbird and an I4 2.0 liter 2000 Ford Focus station wagon, which I still love.I really liked the Honda Accord. My wife really liked the Ford Fusion. We ended up with the Fusion. That\\'s how it goes sometimes. The distinctive styling of the Fusion won out.I think potential midsize sedan buyers are very fortunate to have so many totally acceptable choices from a diverse variety of manufacturers.  Um, huh? I replied to the person who posted a link to cars.com\\'s worst resale list, none of which included a car in this category. I\\'m confused why you think I was talking to you?? :confuse:  fill us in in how you maintain the car. if a fusion is rated at \\'x\\' mpg, and car \\'b\\' is rated at \\'y\\' mpg, do you have a reason to believe vehicle \\'b\\' would get better than the real world mpg, over the fusion?  What you don\\'t seem to understand is Toyota/Honda vehicles are more expensive at sale than a Ford or Chevy product. I have been in this market for 30 years. A like optioned Honda Accord or Toyota Camry will cost you anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000 more in upfront cost. So, yes, the resale for these vehicles better be higher. Take a browse through the Milan vs Camry room. There is a person who paid upwards of $5,000 more for a like optioned Camry over a like optioned Milan. I had very little input on this dual between the two posters by the way.. :surprise:  Give your Fusion some time to break in. I own a 2006 Fusion SEL V6 In Silver Frost and after 14,500 miles my mileage has increased steadily. I am now getting 24MPG average. I also started out pretty low when I first bought the car. I was getting 17MPG!! average and I was treating the car very gently. Don\\'t forget to use the 5W-20 oil, keep your tire pressure in check too. Every bit helps. I am still really enjoying my Fusion. I am very up on maintaining this car. I wash it about once a week. Clean my interior leather with Maguires at least 2x a month ect.. I have Pictures of my Fusion on Carspace! I too like the styling of the Fusion it is very distinctive. :shades:  Just another note. If you have the black leather seating in the Fusion. Get your windows tinted before summer. I was over in central Oregon last year and temps were about 90. We went to get into the car and [email\\xa0protected] the seats were so hot we could not even sit down.  Thx for the advanced warning Scape2. As a matter of fact our Oxford white SEL AWD 2007 Ford Fusion does have the dark charcoal leather interior so I guess we should invest in some windowing tinting huh?Do appreciate your encouraging words about the mileage, too. We have noticed that it is slowly creeping upward, albeit at a very slow rate. The highway mileage seems fine. It\\'s just the 14.8 mpg in-city mileage that is the killer. Then again, neither the Accord or Camry even offers AWD, at any price. Subarus do, of course, but the nearest dealer is 30 miles away.  if a fusion is rated at \\'x\\' mpg, and car \\'b\\' is rated at \\'y\\' mpg, do you have a reason to believe vehicle \\'b\\' would get better than the real world mpg, over the fusion?Nope, I don\\'t believe the vehicle \"B\" would get better real world mileage than a Fusion. Indeed, I think the EPA\\'s city mileage is terribly optimistic for all makes and models. I was just hoping that our Fusion would reach that level, which it has not done.I also believe people often fudge their mileage statistics. Some people might even believe it\\'s impossible for us to get such bad mileage. It is a sad truth, though. Our best in-city only mileage so far is 14.8 mpg and for the first 2,000 miles it was 13.0, which was painful to the pocketbook.Our terrain is flat as a fritter. The climate is mild. The tires are properly inflated. My wife and I are conservative, gentle drivers. But the car only travels short distances at a time, barely even getting up to operating temperature. I doubt any car would match its EPA city rating given our usage.We didn\\'t buy the car to be a mileage champ, just hope it will eventually do better than 14.8. We would be delighted if our Fusion actually reached the revised EPA city estimate of 17 mpg for this powertrain.  My 02 Accord got better mileage than the EPA sticker suggested as does my 06 TL.  If you constantly drove it such that it never warmed up, it would not. No car is going to get good mileage if all trips are, for example, 3 miles long.  I\\'ve never had a car get epa. and that includes fords, nissan\\'s, honda\\'s, Hydai\\'s and GM  Every car I\\'ve had has gotten better than EPA. They have all been manual transmissions though.  With the kind of driving you do I would strongly suggest installing a block heater in your car. What? Yes, a block heater! This device is in almost any car sold in Canada due to the low temperatures in winter. I would suggest you use a timer and use the block heater for about 1 hour every morning, before the car is started.It will do wonders for reaching the operating temperature sooner and it will cost you less than 10 cents a day.Installation with purchase should not be more than 150 bucks at most. You won\\'t regret it.I live near Vancouver, Canada and it does not get really cold here, may be 22 or 25 degrees in December and January. Still, I use my block heater (in a 2001 Toyota Echo and my 98 Chevy full size truck all year round and over 6 years the difference has been up to 8 mpg better in winter and 2 mpg better in summer. It more than pays for itself through gas savings, not to speak of being easier on the battery, the starter, the oil and the alternator. The heater works sooner and this is more pleasant to me, the driver.  Every car I\\'ve had has gotten better than EPA. They have all been manual transmissions though.Ditto for me.   Ditto again, and way better than EPA.  wish I could say the same...must have a heavy foot. plus my drive to work is short and all stop and go unless I time the lights just right which requires some quick acceleration (to the speed limit :blush: ).so is someone trying to make an unscientific assertion that some cars are more likely than others to achieve EPA mileage? I hope not...this forum does not have nearly the sample size to draw any useful conclusions.  this forum does not have nearly the sample size to draw any useful conclusions. I agree. But, considering that the EPA is revising its estimates downward, I\\'d say it safe to assume most driver don\\'t get the milage that is claimed.  EPA already revised the numbers down once. Accord for instance would get 43 highway (I4 stick or auto) under the old system. They now subtract 22% to get the current 34 mpg.The new rating of 31 mpg is just absurdly low. Over 3,100 miles I average 30.9 mpg, and that includes day to day city trips of just a couple of miles each. I don\\'t see how anybody can get only 31 highway unless they don\\'t use their highest gear, or they are going extremely fast.  there was an interesting story on this in CR about a year ago - talking about a more \\'realistic\\' rating system and testing procedures that are badly needed. The outgoing current tests are done in a laboratory and are easily \\'aced\\' by the mfgrs that can, in turn, \\'program\\' their cars to do as well as possible. It\\'s been a joke for years. Real City mpg turns out to be the hardest to match, highway mpg much easier. In any case, the \\'worst\\' offenders in terms of overrated EPA numbers turn out to be the hybrids, followed by some of these V8 engined sedans with these gimmicky \\'fuel saving\\' systems - like the 300C. The VW small diesel, interestingly, comes close to EPA estimates.In all cases, the numbers are, at best, relative to each other - as opposed to honestly achieveable.  On the highway test, almost every car CR tests matches or beats the numbers. Midsize sedan examples Accord epa 34 CR 38 Camry epa 33 CR 36.One example (midsize sedan) of missing the numbers is the new Altima. EPA 34 CR 33 But I think CVT\\'s do artificially well on the test along with the hybrids.   Fuel mileage is impacted the most by individual driving habits and traffic. If you do a lot of stop-n-go driving or short trips like boz (urnews) then you\\'re going to do worse. The 2007 EPA tests did not use the A/C and the speeds were too low while the idle time was too short for today\\'s average city driving. 2008 tests are simply more realistic. The only big change to the highway test was to add an acceleration run up to 80 mph.Nobody will always get the EPA average, even using the 2008 numbers (that\\'s why it\\'s called an average). As others point out the numbers were never meant to be absolute - only relative so you can compare 2 vehicles.  there was an interesting story on this in CR about a year ago - talking about a more \\'realistic\\' rating system and testing procedures that are badly needed. The outgoing current tests are done in a laboratory and are easily \\'aced\\' by the mfgrs that can, in turn, \\'program\\' their cars to do as well as possible. It\\'s been a joke for years.Blah, I think the EPA totally wussed out. If you want the mileage on the sticker, you can\\'t drive like Mario Andretti. If you want to drive like a racer, thats fine but don\\'t expect the mileage on the sticker. I have always done better than EPA estimates and I don\\'t drive particularly slow. Its about anticipating stops and starts; every time you hit the brakes you are converting $$$ (fuel) to heat.I also thing cities that don\\'t time their lights (or time them poorly) should be fined by the EPA or get dinked on some type of federal funding (or given funding to fix traffic flow). If you don\\'t have to lead foot it to make the lights, or spend half of your life idling at them, you get better mileage (if your not moving, your MPG is 0).  I have always done better than EPA estimates and I don\\'t drive particularly slow. Its about anticipating stops and starts; every time you hit the brakes you are converting $$$ (fuel) to heat.Exactly. My dad and I drive completely differently (and we both know it). We made the same commute (within a few blocks of each other) and both had Accord 4-cylinder, EX, Automatics. I average around 29-30 MPG on this route. Dad averaged 24 or so.  The VW small diesel, interestingly, comes close to EPA estimates.In all cases, the numbers are, at best, relative to each other - as opposed to honestly achieveable. Now that you mention that, I forgot about the vw golf diesel i had. I don\\'t know what the epa for it was, but I got about 60 miles a gallon on it. The thing wasn\\'t pretty, and only had 75 hp, but boy did it just sip gas. as for my current cars, they do pretty well, but not epa. My 200sx gets about 40mpg highway and is rated 43. my 07 altima is right now showing 32.2 mpg on the 34 estimate. that probalby has something to do with my driving though. I don\\'t know about anybody else here, but where I live (50 miles south of DC) if you drive 55 on the interstate you\\'ll either get run over or shot. :P Not sure about the wife\\'s civic, I haven\\'t checked it in awhile.  I agree. But, considering that the EPA is revising its estimates downward, I\\'d say it safe to assume most driver don\\'t get the milage that is claimed.No, it\\'s just that only those who get lower complain.Part of the problem is what people call \"city\" driving can vary a whole lot. For some the CR test will be more accurate, for others it will be the EPA test that is closer to their reality.  my particular vehicle (nissan sentra se-r spec V) was rated for 28 highway, but i was able to get over 30 on a couple of trips to central PA from CT. this is at speeds of 80-90mph (the trucks drive REALLY fast on I-80 in PA!) on a constant basis. who knows how any of this is calculated. the only mpg i worry about is what i get based on my driving - not the sticker, not joe schmoe down the street...we all drive differently (speeds, braking habits, acceleration habits, crusing speeds, type of driving city/highway, etc)my two cents...-thene   Part of the problem is what people call \"city\" driving can vary a whole lot.if we all had to \\'drive\\' in Manhattan, mileage would be more properly measured in gallons/mile? my Avalon, which is rated at 22/31, gets me 27 mpg overall with the benefit of about 70% high speed (80 mph or so) highway miles, about what I expected - a run of Suburbans I had which were rated at 13/17, regulary returned 15.5 under the same conditions. So sure, it is possible, to work well within even the current EPA ratings, but if I wanted to drive like Andretti, as one poster pointed out, I would likely be seeing maybe 20 mpg on my car - and a few speeding tickets! Andretti, notwithstanding however, the EPA test procedures on the City side are especially unrealistic when it comes to the \\'gridlock\\' that many of us face day-to-day, those folks most likely to complain about it.  i would bump the tire pressure a couple of pounds. i didn\\'t realize you have an awd model. it will take some time for all those parts to work in. my experience in fords, is that they take 8-10k for the engine to break in. you will see a bump in mileage as it breaks in, but nothing huge.  A friend of mine was looking for a new car and she was leaning on getting an suv because of the ability to fit a lot of stuff in it. She does a lot of yardwork and does quite a lot in terms of home improvement type projects so being able to toss bigger items into her car was something important to her. Because she did not like the gas mileage of most of the suv\\'s that she was attracted to, we began to look at wagons and hatchbacks. I know that this was important for me since many times in my job, I\\'m required to bring large(r) displays that usually would not fit into a standard sedan. Also, I tend to get a bit impatient and don\\'t like waiting for help to do something that I feel like I should be able to do. For example, getting my 42 flat screen the day after thanksgiving would have been hard to get anyone to fight the traffic and help me get the tv home. It was very nice being able to fit it into my mazda 6 hatchback despite the sceptical looks from the guys at Best Buy. I\\'m sure all of you know by now that I like cars that handle well, so an SUV with a higher center of gravity was not an option. Besides, I\\'ve read a high percentage of auto fatalities are due to rollovers which SUV\\'s are much more prone. So in the end, she got a Subaru Outback. It\\'s a great little car with an added advantage of AWD. I was suprised at how quick it was; acceleration from a stop was better than what I remembered when I test drove a 4 cylinder Legacy before getting the Mazda. It\\'s a touch on the slow side, but then she\\'s not so interested in enthusiastic driving either. All in all, it\\'s a good fit for what she wants. And if she needs to toss her lawnmower in it or bookshelf, there\\'s no stopping her. Since many people bring up how much space there is for passengers, I find that I am carrying things more than people so to me this is an important factor to consider. By opening up space, the amount of things I can do increase considerably.  I considered the hatchback, but in the end decided to get the Mazda6 sedan. If we had not resurrected an old minivan, I\\'d have given the hatch a lot more consideration. As it was we decided on keeping the minivan for one of our kids to use for the next few years. After he no longer wants to use it we figure on keeping it for utility use and as a spare vehicle. So I decided to save the $1000 extra that the hatch costs, plus get a bit more headroom in the rear and not be forced to have a wing on the back of my car.But I agree with you that a midsize wagon or hatch does provide great utility and there are not many out there. The Mazda6 hatch gives you that utility while still being a great looking and great handling car.There is (or was) a Subaru Legacy wagon (a conventional wagon unlike the elevated Outback) also. Have they dropped that?  There is (or was) a Subaru Legacy wagon (a conventional wagon unlike the elevated Outback) also. Have they dropped that?Its gone next year. It is still around for \\'07. Thats what happens when you get bought by Toyota, you become a 1 size fits all.  Thats what happens when you get bought by Toyota, you become a 1 size fits all.Toyota bought Subaru? When?  Toyota to invest in 8.7% of our parent (Fuji)Toyota bought the part of Subie GM sold (and a little more, I believe), mostly to get access to additional manufacturing capability in Indiana. Coincidentally perhaps, they have cut their product mix considerably, and \"simplified\" the available drivetrain packages.   Some of you may have heard the news about Ford\\'s Cleveland engine plants. From what I\\'ve gathered on other Ford dedicated forums, CEP #2 has been, or will be soon, re-tooled to produce what is called the PIP D30 engine. What is that you ask? Simply put, it\\'s an improved version of the current Duratec30 engine and is rumored to be unveiled at the 2008 NAIAS in the 2009 Fusion and Escape. New numbers are all the result of speculation but internal Ford sources have claimed it will produce 240+ HP on premium fuel with a slight loss of power if you use regular. Direct injection is also rumored as are improved fuel economy numbers based on the new EPA tests. 3-4 MPG for both city and highway is what I\\'ve read. The latter is supposedly the entire reason for the update so definitely expect that to happen.The Fusion will continue on with the 6-speed tranny (no word on a manumatic) and the Escape with the 4-speed. Once the run is over for these two, both are expected to get the Duratec35 and the Escape a brand new transmission too. I thought that was rather interesting so I decided to share.   I guess the proper reaction to this is: 1) it\\'s about time and we\\'ll see how long it takes to make it in real cars and 2) as soon as \"Detroit\" says \\'improved\\'- visions of the 50 year old 3.8 appear which over this period of time hasn\\'t really improved much and3) why not use the vaunted 3.5 NOW, which at 250hp+ would really make the Fusion something to contend with. If it is as you say, 240hp, 30 mpg highway, and 6-7 second 0-60 would definitely serve to give the car the heart it so badly needs - but is also nothing remarkable in this class even today never mind in a year or two or however long it takes Ford to fulfill its promises.  there is no \"50 year old 3.8\" in any Fusion. :confuse:  I thought that was rather interesting so I decided to share.Definitely interesting. Thanks for sharing. A new lease on life for a very dependable, durable mill.Boz  very good - but there is a 15 year old DT that is every bit as rough and unrefined as that 50 yr old GM 3.8. Ford needs to learn how to build smaller engines, stop falling back on whatever it is they have been doing for years (Detroit SOP), and stop producing cars with antiquated powerplants - it is no surprise to me that Ford is having trouble selling their cars and continues to close planta and lose even more money. They all have substandard \\'old technology\\' engines.The Fusion has a number of good things going for it thanks to Mazda. Had Ford been able to even put the 233hp Sonata engine in it, 2 years ago, I don\\'t think you hear nearly so many negative comments about it. How is it, do you suppose that lil ole Hyundai can do what Ford can\\'t dream of? IMO a \\'good\\' car has everything to do with the sophistication and engineering prowess under the hood and very little to do with styling details, or even improved relabilities, and especially how cheap it is. On that basis, the Honda 4 banger is head and shoulders above the rest for those folks that prefer such things, and the Toyota, Nissan and Honda 6s define what those sort of engines should be.  A new lease on life for a very dependable, durable millPrecisely what Ford SHOULDN\\'T do if it ever expects to sell competitive cars again.  anybody home?with gas prices on the rise, a smaller engine is not a bad thing, especially if it can provide better power, mileage, emissions than the current iteration of the same size.  with gas prices on the rise, a smaller engine is not a bad thing, especially if it can provide better power, mileage, emissions than the current iteration of the same size. Right. And keep the price of the vehicle itself low.  I think this is a good thing for Ford and the Fusion. All the other automakers are stuffing the largest engines they can find into their midsizers. I\\'d expect comparable performance and refinement.  why not use the vaunted 3.5 NOW, which at 250hp+ would really make the Fusion something to contend with. If it is as you say, 240hp, 30 mpg highway, and 6-7 second 0-60 would definitely serve to give the car the heart it so badly needs - but is also nothing remarkable in this class even today never mind in a year or two or however long it takes Ford to fulfill its promises. That seems to be a popular question on the Ford forums too. The most common answer that I saw related to a production issue. Everythng else is getting the 3.5, Taurus/X/Edge/Flex/CX-9/Mazda6/maybe Explorer/maybe Mustang/some Mercury models, or the 3.7 (mfd in the same plants BTW), several Lincolns/maybe Mustang/maybe Explorer/F-150. Until they can get all plants tooled and able to meet those demands, extra capacity can shift to the next Fusion and the next Escape.I feel it has more to do with the engines efficiency in the lighter Fusion and Escape though. Or maybe there\\'s a better answer we have to wait to hear. :confuse:  Precisely what Ford SHOULDN\\'T do if it ever expects to sell competitive cars again.Why? Most Fusions sold are V6 equipped as opposed to the Accord and Camry which are I4 equipped. If they can offer you a V6 for roughly the same price and fuel economy of an I4 wouldn\\'t that interest you?FWIW I do see V6 Fusions all over the road around here. I see some V6 Accords, but to date I can count the number of V6 Camrys I\\'ve seen on one hand. And I think I\\'ve seen the same one more than once. Ford is selling all the Fusions it can make right now. Making the top engine a little better is only going to help. That\\'s my take anyway. :shades:  Ford needs to learn how to build smaller enginesThere was something about the Duratec23 being upped to 2.5L too but that wasn\\'t discussed much and no one form Ford wanted to confirm it.  What Ford and GM really need to do is get back to basics and make cars correctly.RWD. 2.4 - 3.0L Inline 6(VVT of course). This offers the best compromise of power, torque, fuel efficiency, reliability, and weight. Merceds and BMW knew this fifty years ago(fourty in BMW\\'s case) Oh - and it\\'s as smooth as a baby\\'s butt while running. Want to beat the Avalon at its own game? Make a 300HP VVT I-6 engine. Stuff it in every car that you can.It\\'s also what people want in midsize cars and small SUVs and so on. As for RWD, you can have RWD and not have a problem with a driveshaft tunnel. It just wakes a multi-part driveshaft like Volvo put in its 960.GM and Ford, actually could pull apart an old 960 and learn thing or two I bet. Absolutely superb car.   Make a 300HP VVT I-6 engine. Stuff it in every car that you can. Duh, don\\'t you think they would, if they could? A lot more technology goes into building an engine than the shape of the block. :confuse:  Well that 300HP 3.6L VVT V-6 will be here in a few months.The 3.6L in the Cadillac cts (and Saturn Aura XR/Outlook) will have a Direct injection model for 2008. Unfortunately it won\\'t be in the Saturns But if you can swing the Cady... :shades:  Duh, don\\'t you think they would, if they could? A lot more technology goes into building an engine than the shape of the block. ***Two things come to mind:1 - an inline engine is much simpler to make and is much more reliable. Less custom tooling and such as well, especially if it\\'s an OHC design.2 - Mercedes made a 200HP(NET, to the wheels!) 3.0L i-6 engine 45 years ago. Not in a racing car, but in their normal passenger car line. A 300HP VVT and computer controlled(as opposed to mechanical fuel injection, no less!) should be able to get 300HP quite easily out of a 3.0L engine. If not, slap a small supercharger on it. It\\'ll still weigh less than the 3.6VVT(or about the same)The 3.6VVT is a good compromise, I guess. GM has a winner -- the next 3800 in that engine. MY only gripe is that they need to put more of the low-end torque versions like in the Lacrosse CXS in cars instead of the high HPO tuned vesions(CTS, etc). Honestly, the LaCrosse CXS is more fun to drive than the current CTS because of the diesel-like torquer curve(maxxes at something silly like 1400-1600rpm, IIRC)GM can do it, to be sure. I hope they do. But if they don\\'t, well, life is tough and there are a LOT of things I care more about than car companies.Chrysler - lost cause.Ford - too slow to react, and also doomed to failure. They don\\'t have the R&D that GM has on tap and their mangement isn\\'t as willing to change as quickly(GM is retiscent but when it has to move, it can - Ford will whine and look for a change in the laws or regulations or something)  i>Most Fusions sold are V6 equipped as opposed to the Accord and Camry which are I4 equipped.this is a cost issue that Ford shares with Hyundai, the fact that the Fusion V6 will be about the same dollars as an I4 Camcord. Those folks that buy the Camcord I4s getting a better smoother and less bothersome engine and a whole lot better FE. Ford is only \\'selling\\' (given the rate at which they are losing money maybe \\'selling\\' and \\'giving away\\' are interchangeable terms in Fordspeak) all the Fusions they can make right now because they are intentionally limiting production down there in Mexico. I assure that if the engines in the Fusion was even close to those others I mentioned, not only would the Fusion production and sales be up, but also that the price differential would be a whole lot less - apples to apples. If Ford truly wants to sell \\'a better idea\\' they need to start with truly better drivetrains - in the process of producing a car that can justify a premium price. For Ford to have to compete with the Hyundais of the world is a losing proposition, because right now that Korean V6 is clearly superior to that \\'old tech\\' DT.  Another small but important error on your part...the Dura Tech 3.0 first appeared in 1996 Taurus/Sable vehicles which makes it an 11 year old design. Correction: a smaller 2.5 liter? version appeared around the same time on the Contour and this MAY have been 1995. Either way it is isn\\'t 15 years old.  For Ford to have to compete with the Hyundais of the world is a losing proposition, because right now that Korean V6 is clearly superior to that \\'old tech\\' DT.Whhaaaaaaaaaaat? The Hyundai motor dates back to Mitsubishi designs from the 80s. They added variable valve timing, just like Ford did in the Jag with the DT (although why they didn\\'t do it in the Fusion/Mazda6 I don\\'t know)The 4 cylinder is all new, but its a GEMA motor, so its in Hyyndai, Mitsubishi, DCX, and others.  Hmmm, and it looks like the 3.0 in the Accord goes back to 1997...a whole year after Ford\\'s.I still think Captain does not know the difference between the Ford Vulcan 3.0 and the Duratec 3.0.  Ford added VCT to the DT3.0 in the 2003 LS (different design than the Jag version). And the current DT3.0 in the Fusion does have VCT.  Make a 300HP VVT I-6 engine. Stuff it in every car that you can.If even BMW can\\'t make a naturally aspirated 300HP I6 then I really don\\'t have much confidence in every other manufactures.That\\'s including Toyota, Honda, Nissan, GM and of course, Ford.A V6 might not be as \"refine\" as the I6 but probably has more potential of making 300+ HP. Rumor has it that the Toyota 3.5L 2GR-FSE has the potential of making 350HP and Nissan already demonstrated that their 3.7L VQ can make 330HP.  That is incorrect. The 2.4L I4, 3.3L V6, and 3.8L V6 used in the Sonata and Azera are new designs, and do not date from a Mitsubishi design from the \\'80s.  Another small (or maybe not that small) but important error. The 3.3 liter (Sonata and Santa FE) the 3.8 liter (Azera,Entourage van and Vera Cruz) V-6\\'s AND the 2.4 liter 4 (Sonata) cylinder motors are totally new designed and manufactured by Hyundai. Further, Mitsubishi has not had a hand in any engine design (with the exception of the GEMA engine)since the late 80\\'s as you correctly noted. Once Hyundai got going on car manufacturing they no longer needed help in engine design. The still used 2.7 liter V-6 is of unknown design...unknown by me that is, maybe Mitsu had some part in that one because it started life as a 2.5 liter earlier in the 90\\'s. Small wonder then that many still discount Hyundai as a \"real car\" manufacturer. Many have facts stuck in the 80\\'s and believe them to still be true.  A new lease on life for a very dependable, durable millPrecisely what Ford SHOULDN\\'T do if it ever expects to sell competitive cars again.As the proud owner of a 2007 SEL AWD 3.0-liter V6, 6-speed automatic transmission Fusion ($27,105 MSRP) I find the car to be very competitive. All Ford vehicles may not be at the top of the heap, Captain2, but some certainly are. I see nothing wrong, or disadvantageous, with refining a good product to make it better. Besides, the 3.5 Duratec V6 has already been proclaimed by Wards Automotive to be one of the best 10 engines in the world. It just that FoMoCo can\\'t produce enough of them to satisfy the need. Boz  As many here know (but not all as you speculate)the OHV Vulcan 3.0 liter made its debut in the original Taurus/Sable in 1986 and carried on for years..no decades tweaked but basically unchanged. A pretty good engine at that if not that powerful @140-153 hp or so in its final form.  oh yeah, quite a bit of difference, the pushrod \\'Vulcan\\' a really difficult engine to love - the DT was a competitive engine when it first appeared in the 90s - the problem as I see it, is that it was not a solid enough design that it could improved (from a smoothness/refinement point of view) in the same way that Honda certainly has done with their SOHC VVTi or the Nissan VQ (which is older yet). Or maybe it\\'s because that Ford simply couln\\'t afford to do it. Ford\\'s valve control system is incidentally very rudimentary compared to most of these modern engines (the \\'i\\') and this may be one of the reasons why the Ford V6 doesn\\'t feel or sound anything like those other engines - I don\\'t know why, but can only judge the result. This all has very little to with HP and everything to do with the overall driving experience \\'pushing\\' let\\'s say a Fusion V6 vs. let\\'s say a Camcordima V6. The old 200 hp 3 liter in the previous Camry also a pleasure to drive despite the power shortage only because it wasn\\'t lacking in those refinement issues. The new 268hp 2GR is in a class by itself at least until Honda gets to work on the 08 Accord. The VQ, of course, redefined what these engines should be 5 years ago, predates the DT, and remains the standard by which these things should be judged, but IMO, slightly coarser and more strained than certainly the 2GR and maybe even that old Honda V6. The Sonata 3.3 surprised me in how refined (and powerful) it was, especially compared to the old 2.7 and not a whole lot different than the 3.5VQ in my wife\\'s 03 Altima.Understand that this is a \\'value\\' judgement kind of thing meaning that I happen to put a lot of importance on how an engine feels and sounds at high (4500+) rpm. I can understand those that might be perfectly happy driving anything with a DT in it, but, I simply don\\'t believe thst those folks drive the way I do   Those folks that buy the Camcord I4s getting a better smoother and less bothersome engine and a whole lot better FE.But you said that Ford needed a more powerful V6 to be competitive. I say they offer the V6 at I4 prices to do that and improving that motor in every way helps that cause. In doing that they can potentially pull people away from an Accord or Camry I4 purchase because the Fusion will offer much better performance for a very minimal FE and refinement hit. Forget about competing with the V6 models. That market is very small.If they ever feel they need a souped up V6 to compete with the V6 CamCords then they can always offer some sort of sport model with a turbo or the 3.5L. I don\\'t see that happening though.Ford is only \\'selling\\' (given the rate at which they are losing money maybe \\'selling\\' and \\'giving away\\' are interchangeable terms in Fordspeak) all the Fusions they can make right now because they are intentionally limiting production down there in Mexico.Hermosillo can only produce about 300k vehicles per year at full tilt and they are at full tilt producing all three variants. They\\'d need another line to produce more and I don\\'t even know if that\\'s possible given all the plant closings right now. Production isn\\'t limited in the way I think you were implying.I assure that if the engines in the Fusion was even close to those others I mentioned, not only would the Fusion production and sales be up, but also that the price differential would be a whole lot less - apples to apples. If Ford truly wants to sell \\'a better idea\\' they need to start with truly better drivetrains - in the process of producing a car that can justify a premium price.So given Ford\\'s current financial situation you think they can sell more cars by raising the price? Even if they improve the car they still have to keep the price down right now and attract as many people as they can to their lots IMO. That\\'s certainly not the way old Henry did it.  Understand that this is a \\'value\\' judgement kind of thing meaning that I happen to put a lot of importance on how an engine feels and sounds at high (4500+) rpm. I can understand those that might be perfectly happy driving anything with a DT in it, but, I simply don\\'t believe thst those folks drive the way I do I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever driven a Camry or Accord V6 but I have owned a Mazda6 V6 and never had a problem with it\\'s refinement. Our Escape Duratec30 was a bit coarse at high RPM but we rarely pushed it there because the low end was enough to get us around the local hills and valleys. The Mazda version was much quieter and free revving than the Ford version IMO. The Mazda also had an exhaust tuned to sound throaty which I think might leave the impression of a noisy engine on some people when it really isn\\'t.  The 3.3 liter (Sonata and Santa FE) the 3.8 liter (Azera,Entourage van and Vera Cruz) V-6\\'s AND the 2.4 liter 4 (Sonata) cylinder motors are totally new designed and manufactured by Hyundai.Further, Mitsubishi has not had a hand in any engine design (with the exception of the GEMA engine)since the late 80\\'s as you correctly noted.I was under the impression the 2.4 IS the GEMA engine :confuse: Small wonder then that many still discount Hyundai as a \"real car\" manufacturer. Many have facts stuck in the 80\\'s and believe them to still be true.None of this info was being used \"against\" Hyundai, Ford outsources parts of engine development to Cosworth, Toyota has help from Yamaha, etc.  No, although I\\'m not entirely sure off-hand the size of the GEMA engine (it may well be 2.4 liter too and I believe there is a larger version also) the 2.4 to which I am referring to is used in the 4 cyl. version of the Optima and Sonata.Yeah I know but many do not have a modern view of Hyundai and remember the bad old days and think they still apply...people less informed than you of course!!  a couple of things-I think it is far more likely that the Camcord buyer is shopping the I4 over the V6 because of fuel economy (and price) issues and not looking at the 4 cylinder as much of a power tradeoff BECAUSE those particular engines are every bit as smooth and quiet as the Ford V6.I don\\'t know for sure, but I believe that the Mexican Fusion plant is not operating at capacity and nor has it ever - a condition that is good for Ford in the sense that it keeps supply down and demand up as high as possible. Chrysler has a big problem right now with overproduction and excess inventory.As Honda and Toyota keep proving, it is possible to sell things relative to window sticker and not relative to some rebate under invoice. It is not generally good for any car, the car buyer, and especially the mfgr. that they have to discount heavily. The only thing that is required to avoid this - a product that either IS GOOD ENOUGH (or innovative enough), or at least, perceived as being so and presto, the educated buyer will pay the price. Ford\\'s problem, perhaps, is that they don\\'t have the resources financially and otherwise to do any better.  It is not generally good for...the car buyer...that they have to discount heavily :confuse: Yeah, right...I really hated having to pay $5000 under the sticker price, when I bought the car I wanted. I feel so bad, I think I\\'ll send a check for that amount to the dealer...or should I send it to Mazda.The reality is people are not currently willing to pay as much for a Fusion, even if it is as good as an Accord or Camry...mostly because they will not believe it is as good, even if it could somehow be objectively determined that it is just as good. Note that I am not making a claim one way or the other with regard to the Fusion compared to Accord or Camry. I am saying it does not matter what an objective comparison shows, perception remains that Accord and Camry are much better. Therefore Ford must sell for a lower price.  \"...they [Ford] offer the V6 at I4 prices... In doing that they can potentially pull people away from an Accord or Camry I4 purchase because the Fusion will offer much better performance for a very minimal FE and refinement hit.\"No, the Fusion V6 does not perform \"much better\" than a Honda I4. Let\\'s look at some numbers.MSN Autos (citing Consumer Reports):2006 Accord I4 - 2.4L (166hp) 5A0-60 mph 7.911/4 mile 16.22 @ 90.8 mph2007 Fusion V6 - 3.0L (221hp) 6A0-60 mph 7.471/4 mile 15.78 @ 90.9 mphDIFFERENCE0-60 mph 0.441/4 mile 0.44, 00.1 mphAnd remember, my Accord 2.4L I4 (with manual trans) will take a 3.0 DT. I have tested this in the real world, when I found myself next to another young guy in a V6 Mazda6 (automatic, just like the Fusion) at a stoplight. He wanted my lane when the light went green, but ended up merging over right *behind* me. I could hear that DT over my I4 the whole time...   I don\\'t know for sure, but I believe that the Mexican Fusion plant is not operating at capacity and nor has it ever - a condition that is good for Ford in the sense that it keeps supply down and demand up as high as possible. My understanding is that it is. Ford sold roughly 220,000 cars from that plant by 12/06. Capacity is 305,000 according to Ford\\'s site so they probably are at or very near capacity to keep up with demand. Since the Zephyr changed to the MKZ and the Fusion added AWD sales have been up even more so far this year. Conversely, I\\'ve seen that Sonota sales are tanking. I\\'ve seen nothing official on that so I could be wrong.I think the price, with lower than average Ford incentives, is getting people in the showroom door right now and it\\'s only a matter of time before word spreads. If that goes well then they may be on to something and nothing will help that more than some little tweaks to the drivetrain and content to keep things going.  YEAH RIGHT is right and all you need to do is think about it. Your $5 grand is for the most part false savings because what that car you bought so cheap is worth a few years down the road will always be based on what they cost to buy new. Resale values have the biggest influence on what it costs most of us to actually own a car. The Accord in this group, which generally are bought within 2 grand or so of sticker, have the highest resale values and also tend to do very well in cost of operation numbers. Also the reason why heavily discounted cars tend to to very well in things like \\'Initial Satisfaction Indexes\\' - getting that big discount up front does have a tendency to make us all feel more satisfied because we all feel at that point that we got somethin\\' for nothin\\'.  The Fusion may prove to be the greatest discovery since Adam figured out what was under those fig leaves - we won\\'t know for another few years. Remember that the MKZ did get the new 3.5 and therefore does not suffer from the same maladies as the Fusion/Milan/6.Hyundai which had been very aggressive in an attempt to get as many of us in their cars as possible - pulled back their horns a bit apparently recognizing that it does them no good to sell the Sonata too cheaply.This recent AWD craze is interesting to me - would think that maybe 90% of us don\\'t drive on roads bad enough that just FWD isn\\'t just fine, so why pay the added cost, mechanical complexities, and FE penalties for it?  I think your numbers are off. C&D tends to do crazy things to cars for their 0-60 times while CR does not. C&D could only get low 8s out of their 2007 Accord I4 ATX. See here.The only 0-60 time I could find on the Fusion with ATX from C&D was an estimate of 7.5 seconds so that one looks to be about right. IIRC MT did 7.2 seconds in a Fusion V6. I realize all these times we\\'ve posted were not done by the same drivers, on the same track, and under the same conditions but it\\'s all we have right now as far as an apples to apples comparison goes. Do you have the link to that 0-60 time for the Accord I4? I\\'m not saying you\\'re wrong, but that sounds more like the manual tranny time.  No, the Fusion V6 does not perform \"much better\" than a Honda I4.thanks for looking up the numbers, kind of fortifies my point. Going a step further, which car do you suppose feels and sounds better doing it. Not to mention the 4 or 5 mpg difference in FE, which to many buyers in this class is more important to them than even that? Not my personal cup of tea, but you surely can\\'t fault anybody for buying something capable of 30mpg overall, in what not too long ago was a full sized car!  The Fusion may prove to be the greatest discovery since Adam figured out what was under those fig leaves - we won\\'t know for another few years.Let\\'s not get too carried away now!  I even wouldn\\'t buy one for lack of a V6 and manual tranny combo. But that\\'s not common.Remember that the MKZ did get the new 3.5 and therefore does not suffer from the same maladies as the Fusion/Milan/6. I don\\'t know that I\\'d call them maladies but if for lack of a better word. My dad has a Zephyr, I\\'ve driven it, and it has plenty of power for the large hills around here which is all I ask. The 3.5L is up my alley too, as more power always is for said hills, but it is completely unnecessary for the average Joe IMO. It surely helps sales though.This recent AWD craze is interesting to me - would think that maybe 90% of us don\\'t drive on roads bad enough that just FWD isn\\'t just fine, so why pay the added cost, mechanical complexities, and FE penalties for it? Living in the NE I do want it. However I also drive a RWD sports coupe through the same snow without problems so I see your point. Maybe with all this power being sent to the front wheels now people are beginning to notice torque steer and wheel spin and don\\'t like it? AWD corrects both of those problems and gives some people something to one-up the Joneses with. :P  See post 795. I don\\'t think his numbers were right for the Accord. If C&Ds time is more accurate then my point with the new Fusion motor makes even more sense. You get performance that falls between the V6 and I4 versions of the competition for the price of the latter. If they can get the FE close or the same as the I4s then what\\'s not to like?No it\\'s not everyone\\'s cup of tea as you said previously but it could be a very smart move. Smarter than just giving in to pressure and dumping the 3.5L in the Fusion\\'s engine bay.  /ot but....The naturally aspirated 3.2L in the M3 produced 333 hp.  Ah - you beat me to it. 300HP with a direct injection design and VVT should be doable out of a 3.0L inline engine. Compression might be a bit high, but well within reasonable limits.  Actually, the 2.4L engine in the Sonata and Optima is not the GEMA engine (known as the World Engine by DCX), and the factory in which it is produced is not part of GEMA. It\\'s the Theta engine, which shares its basic block and cylinder head design with the GEMA engine, but there are major differences between the Theta and the World Engine.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Theta_engineThe 3.3L V6 in the Sonata (and the 3.8L in the Azera) is known as the Lambda. It is not a GEMA engine, but it is a new design from Hyundai, not a warmed-over Mitsubishi design.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Lambda_engine  Your $5 grand is for the most part false savings because what that car you bought so cheap is worth a few years down the road will always be based on what they cost to buy new.No, it\\'s not false savings, it\\'s real money in my pocket. Dollars that I got to keep while buying the car that I wanted to buy. If you look at depreciation in actual dollars, rather than percentages, there is not much difference between Accord, Mazda6, or Fusion.If you paid $20K and you car is worth $12K in 5 years that not better than paying $16K and having my car be worth $8K. Not that I care much, in any case, as I buy cars to keep them.My $5000 is also earning about $200 per year interest, after taxes. In five years that is another $1000 \"saved\".  If C&Ds time is more accurate Car and Driver seems to be the kings of car abuse and will regulary report acceleration times (especially 0-60) that is substantially better than any of us would want to even try to achieve - probably because we paid good money for that car? CR, I think, does things more like what you and I might infrequently try and therefore those differences more realistic.May be giving into pressure as you suggest, but a 260hp Fusion with a higher degree of engine refinement would sell like hotcakes and you are right, these better V6s do not necessarily cost much more at the pumps. The FE that is possible out of the Toyota 2GR a good example of that.  Nah, C&D just holds it in 2nd gear until it hits the rev limiter. Makes for nice 0-60 times, considering most automatics have mile high gearing.  think about it on whatever basis you wish then, and pretend that the average that most of us keep cars is not between 3 and 4 years. Of course, if you keep your Mazda to the point that the paint is peeling off and the wheels are falling off, then you probably will save all that money that you think you did. Most of us don\\'t do that, however, and do have to deal with those crooked used car depts. at trade-in time, and mysteriously that Accord buyer is getting at least a good portion of his $5k purchase premium back, a little kbb.com research as well as Edmunds/Intellichoice cost to own numbers all confirm this.  We\\'ll never agree on the 0-60 acceleration numbers. However, I can say that from personal experience actually driving the cars and from participating in a few \"stoplight showdowns,\" that the Accord I4 5M is every bit as fast as the Fusion V6 6A and the automatic Accord isn\\'t too far behind. Certainly, you can\\'t state that the DT30 is \"much faster\" than the Accord or Altima inline 4\\'s. I like the Fusion, it was on my \"short list\" at purchase time and I heavily evaluated it. It is a competitive car which keeps looking better as Ford adds standard features, and the reliability reports are looking good. Resale value remains to be seen.However, the Fusion will absolutely require very substantial powertrain updates to remain competitive, especially with the new Accord just around the corner. I really hope Ford doesn\\'t ignore it as long as they have ignored the Focus. That is a perfect example of a car that could have been a serious contender if it had been continuously developed and refined through the years instead of remaining basically the same. I don\\'t think the Duratec is going to cut it.  and the Fusion added AWD sales have been up even more so far this year. fusion sales are still at the bottom of the barrel, and by a big margin. Its not that impressive to have a 205 sales increase when you only sold 45,000 the year before. Here\\'s some numbers for you: rounded and year to datetoyota camry: 144,000honda accord: 121,000chevy impala: 108,000nissan altima: 90,000ford fusion: 51,000  Thanks for posting about comparing real dollars rather the per cent ages, which can be quite misleading. I just checked Edmund\\'s True Cost to Own stats and saw that it lists the TMV price for a 2007 Sonata SE w/XM @ $20,706. We bought one on 2/24/07 at a purchase price of $16,651. (Both figures need to have dealer fees + TTL added; our dealer fees were $189.)Knock $4,055 off that TCO estimate and you\\'ll see quite a difference. The financing, insurance and tax info. are also off the mark. If you finance $5,000 and I finance $10,000, my finance charges will obviously be more than double your finance charges. In CT, owners (or lesees) pay a property tax every year on their cars. The tax rate varies from town to town. My town\\'s current tax rate is $21.65 for every $1,000 of the cars value. One town next door has a tax rate of (about) $62 for every $1,000 of value. Another bordering town has a tax rate of $17.89 for each $1,000 of value. (This also means that a car which has a lower \"value\" pays less property tax each year.) Insurance: forget what TCO says. How old are you, married or single, your driving record, what town do you live in, how do you use your car (not driven to work, driven to work how many miles?, business use), do you own or rent, do you have other insurance with the same company, have you been continuously insured for the last six months, FICO scores, etc. TCO and other similar estimates need to start off their comparison with real street prices, not an inflated number. But, your point about the $20K car being worth $12K in 5 yrs vs a $16K car being worth $8K in 5 yrs is valid. I don\\'t pay my bills based upon per cent ages. The mortgage company, utilities, insurance company, etc. want REAL dollars, not per cent ages.  the fusion is somewhat limited by manufacturing capacity. i think it shares the line with milan and mkz.i drive by a chevy dealership every day. those impalas are starting to appeal to me.   Car and Driver seems to be the kings of car abuse and will regulary report acceleration times (especially 0-60) that is substantially better than any of us would want to even try to achieve - probably because we paid good money for that car? CR, I think, does things more like what you and I might infrequently try and therefore those differences more realistic.That\\'s what I said. But yet someone posted a much better 0-60 time for an Accord I4 with auto tranny. Doesn\\'t make sense at all.  However, I can say that from personal experience actually driving the cars and from participating in a few \"stoplight showdowns,\" that the Accord I4 5M is every bit as fast as the Fusion V6 6A and the automatic Accord isn\\'t too far behind. Certainly, you can\\'t state that the DT30 is \"much faster\" than the Accord or Altima inline 4\\'s. Your personal experience with the 5M in the Accord doesn\\'t really matter when we\\'re comparing auto trannies. What you posted in #791 is directly below:2006 Accord I4 - 2.4L (166hp) 5A 0-60 mph 7.91 1/4 mile 16.22 90.8 mph 2007 Fusion V6 - 3.0L (221hp) 6A 0-60 mph 7.47 1/4 mile 15.78 90.9 mph DIFFERENCE 0-60 mph 0.44 1/4 mile 0.44, 00.1 mph That 0-60 time you posted is not right according to C&D whom we all can agree tends to really push a car to get times you and I would never dream of trying to get. Since they did publish a time, as I linked you to, of low 8s we have to assume that the Accord I4 5A is \"much\" slower than the V6 Fusion 6A. If you don\\'t agree then don\\'t ever think of saying the V6 Accord is \"much\" faster than the V6 Fusion because the difference in number of seconds off the pace for each comparo is negligible. I don\\'t think the Duratec is going to cut it. I agree. Not for the long term it won\\'t anyway. I think I did point out that the next gen Fusion will get the Duratec35 somewhere near 2010 for 2011 IIRC. Updating the Fusion, whether it be content or powertrain, each year is a good thing that I hope we can all agree on. That seems to be the trend so far.  mysteriously that Accord buyer is getting at least a good portion of his $5k purchase premium back says captainfunny you admit that you won\\'t get all of that $5k back. And it stands to reason that you won\\'t; a used car is still a used car and when it a buyer is comparing to new car prices used cars will always depreciate a lot. So if you want to pretend you\\'re getting a car that\\'s worth 5k more because you don\\'t like the engine note of a car when I bet 99% of the time you\\'re listening to the stereo and not the sound of the engine, more power to you. In the end, I think in the Mazda 6, the duratec sounds great. It has a nice growl to it that confirms that your intentions are being matched by the car. As automotive.com wrote about the Mazda 6 v6, \"The 3.0-liter V6 in the 6s greatly increases the fun. Like the four-cylinder, it has continuously variable valve timing (VVT) for its intake camshaft; but on the V6, this feature seems to be used more effectively, providing better low-down torque along with a willingness to rev, with good gas mileage and a nice set of sounds from the air intake and the dual exhausts. The Mazda V6 doesn\\'t feel like it has as much low-rpm torque as the Toyota and Honda V6 engines, but it loves to rev and it\\'s a lot of fun to drive.\"Of course I would have been willing to pay extra for a car that braked 15 feet shorter in 60-0, or a car that had less body lean when cornering, or even for a car that was less generically styled. Thing is, though, I didn\\'t have to pay more and in fact spent thousands less. And during the time I have this car, I will enjoy every curve, make thanks for great brakes everytime someone pulls out of a driveway in my path, and I will walk up to my car with pride instead of wondering which of 10 other simialar cars in the parking lot is mine as I load a big screen into my car while the other sedan owners make a second trip or pay for delivery.  fusion sales are still at the bottom of the barrel, and by a big margin. Its not that impressive to have a 205 sales increase when you only sold 45,000 the year before. Here\\'s some numbers for you: rounded and year to date I don\\'t recall ever saying Fusion sales were at or near the top. Did I? I know the sales numbers and already told you that the Fusion and it\\'s sisters only sell about 220k units per year which is about half of the number of CamCords (each) sold each year. My point was that Fusion sales keep climbing and that is true. Fusion sales are actually at 52,000 units this YTD as of 4/30/2007. That\\'s a 22.4% increase over the previous year. Why didn\\'t you include the Sonata? It\\'s sales are down 31% from last year at this time. See a trend? Also, Fusion sales to fleets are pretty low according to Ford and Hyundai just made some news about selling in high volumes to fleets IIRC.  Of course I would have been willing to pay extra for a car that braked 15 feet shorter in 60-0That was one thing I really loved about that car when I had it. The brakes were nothing short of phenomenal.  The Hermi plant is running at capacity. Don\\'t forget they also make the Milan/MKZ there too. And yes, Ford is selling Fusions/Milans/MKZ\\'s at a nice pace. I would much rather have Ford not try to make 500,000 Fusions and keep the quality up on these vehicles. So far the Fusion/Milan/MKZ are proving to be very reliabile and well built vehicles.  Of course you take the numbers that best suit your needs. I too have done \"real world\" testing with my Fusion V6 and your dreaming my friend. I easily outran both a auto 4cyl Accord and a Manual Accord on I-205. This guy had a brand new Accord and he was ticked when I started to actually play with him. I would let him catch up to me, get about even with me then WAMMO.. I was gone! There are reviews showing the Fusion does 0-60 in 7.1 seconds by the way out on the internet.. take a look around... :shades:  I\\'m right with you man. I did price an Accord with the Same options as my Fusion and it was easily $3,000+ more. Not to include the 4.9% interest I would be paying over the lifetime of the loan! I pay 0% on the Fusion. I came out way, way ahead with my Fusion. Trying to convince people Accords are either cheaper or within $1,000 of either a Fusion or Sonata is not going to work. Anyone who shops knows the Accord/Camry are pricey vehicles. This is what the Fusion/Milan offer, value at the right price. Remember when Honda/Toyota did that? :surprise:  \"The FE that is possible out of the Toyota 2GR a good example of that.\"Are you so sure about that? Get out on the net people are complaining about the MPG of the V6 Camry. I also posted a link to a site that did independant studies of MPG on the Camry back in this forum. And the actual mileage they were getting was about 4MPG LESS for the Camry..   I guess since McDonalds sells more hamburgers than Wendys that they must be the best too..   Ford is going in the right direction. They are building a solid, quality car for less than their competitors. It will take time and miles and word of mouth before the general public figure this one out. I like the Duratec 3.0 with VVT. Mine revs freely and I like the growling sound myself. At idle I can\\'t even tell its running. And in everyday driving its just as quiet as the Accord/Camry. Someone posted actual DB ratings way back in this forum. Granted when you put the pedal down, the Fusion is a bit louder than the Camry/Accord. But in everyday driving it is just as quiet.  It\\'s actually the other way around on the Sonata... HMA is selling fewer of them to fleets than last year, which accounts for at least some of the downturn in sales.  Also, Fusion sales to fleets are pretty low according to Ford and Hyundai just made some news about selling in high volumes to fleets IIRC.Wrong on both counts. Fusion fleets are actually going up as we speak, while Hyundai\\'s Sonata fleet initiative ended Q4 last year (a program lasted almost a year from early 06). Sonata sales will be down for the rest of this year because the majority of 06 included additional fleet units, which otherwise would not have skewed the YOY comparison.  Whhaaaaaaaaaaat? The Hyundai motor dates back to Mitsubishi designs from the 80s. They added variable valve timing, just like Ford did in the Jag with the DT (although why they didn\\'t do it in the Fusion/Mazda6 I don\\'t know)The 4 cylinder is all new, but its a GEMA motor, so its in Hyyndai, Mitsubishi, DCX, and others.Time to get better informed here. Just to summarize from other posts and add some add\\'l info:Hyundai\\'s new Lambda V6s (3.3L & 3.8L) currently can be found in various Hyundai and Kia applications, including the Sonata. Competent engines and flexible, as the Lambdas can be tuned to as high as 300hp (which is a likely candidate on the base engine of the upcoming luxury RWD sedan next year).The Theta I4s also can be found in many Hyundai and Kia applications, including the Sonata. Don\\'t be confused, these are not the same as the GEMA engines. Hyundai is, however, receiving royalties for these I4s.Bottom line, both the I4s and the V6s are designed in-house by Hyundai.  I think it was Nov.,\\'06 that Hyundai drastically cut its fleet sales. That probably accounted for most of the Sonata sales reduction, if not 100% of it, during a time of declining auto sales for the industry.  Whhaaaaaaaaaaat? The Hyundai motor dates back to Mitsubishi designs from the 80s. They added variable valve timing, just like Ford did in the Jag with the DT (although why they didn\\'t do it in the Fusion/Mazda6 I don\\'t know)It should also be known that the Mazda 6 has VVT. From automobile.com, \"Like the four-cylinder, it has continuously variable valve timing (VVT) for its intake camshaft; but on the V6, this feature seems to be used more effectively, providing better low-down torque along with a willingness to rev, with good gas mileage and a nice set of sounds from the air intake and the dual exhausts...\"\"Zoom-zoom is in plentiful supply regardless of which model you choose. Even the four-cylinder 6i is a hoot to drive. Order it with the five-speed manual and the fun zone starts at about 4000 rpm, where the engine is very responsive. The 2.3-liter, double-overhead-cam engine loves to rev and acceleration is on par with that of other four-cylinder mid-size sedans....\"  Next generation RWD Tiburon (known as BK) will be getting turbocharged Theta I4 220-250 HP and 3.8 Lamda 300+ HP.http://www.bobaedream.co.kr/board/bbs/news_view.php?code=nnews&No=22492   Hmm...totally forgot about the 3.2L I6 in the M3. Thanks for reminding me that, guys.Isn\\'t that right the 3.2L I6 was so expensive to make and its compression ratio was so high that it is just not feasible for mess-manufactured cars? Great for a halo car like M3, however.BTW, what\\'s the torque of that 3.2L I6?I\\'ll take the 3.0L I6 (naturally aspirated version) on a 2800 lbs sedan any given day... :blush:  Isn\\'t that right the 3.2L I6 was so expensive to make and its compression ratio was so high that it is just not feasible for mess-manufactured cars? Great for a halo car like M3, however.No.It was a halo engine manufactured for just one application however.  I investigated the claim that cars with higher initial prices, such as Accord, cost less than lower priced alternative mid-size cars, when trade-in value is considered. Since my recent purchase was a Mazda6i, I compared this to Honda Accord. I bought my SVE for $16,100 and at the time I estimated, based on invoice less a $750 incentive that an Accord would have cost me $3300 more. I think that I got a better than average price, if so, perhaps a more typical price difference may have been about $2500.Then I looked at the price of a comparably equipped 2003 used Mazda6i vs. 2003 Honda Accord LX. The price difference with 60,000 miles ranged from $1400 to $1900, depending on condition and whether looking at private party sale or trade in. For average condition, trade-in difference was about $1500. With the assumption that a buyer would on average pay about $2500 less for the Mazda, this still leaves an average net advantage of $1000 for the Mazda6.Now, in any financial analysis, the time value of money should not be neglected. Today I can earn about 3.8% in a tax exempt money market account. $2500 invested at that rate, for 4 years will be worth $2800, so this increases the advatage of the cheaper car to $1300. The advantage would increase to more like $1800 for one who must finance the purchase at 7% interest.Of course, there is a lot of estimating and gueswork involved in this, but I certainly see no evidence that an Accord costs less when trade-in is considered. The Accord might cost about the same, at best, for some buyers...but this is certainly no reason to fear cars like the Mazda6, Fusion, Sonata, etc.  Wrong on both counts. Fusion fleets are actually going up as we speak, while Hyundai\\'s Sonata fleet initiative ended Q4 last year (a program lasted almost a year from early 06). Sonata sales will be down for the rest of this year because the majority of 06 included additional fleet units, which otherwise would not have skewed the YOY comparisonSo do you have some links for all of us to see then? Instead of just telling people they are wrong and being done with it, how about you pass on some of your infinite wisdom? :shades: I\\'ve read the opposite, albeit some time ago, and want to see the latest figures too.  Here\\'s an excerpt from a Hyundai press release that mentions the reduction in fleet sales: HYUNDAI REPORTS NOVEMBER SALESFOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif., 12/01/2006 Hyundai Motor America sold 28,417 units during the month of November, down 14.9 percent compared with November 2005.&#147;Sales declined in November due to our strategy to reduce fleet sales in 2006 as well as the reduced availability of our new Elantra due to continued effects of the strike earlier this year. Improving availability of new models such as the Elantra and Santa Fe will help our year-end close on a very strong note. We are very encouraged by the sales of our new Santa Fe, which experienced a 52 percent increase in sales over last year,&#148; said Mark Barnes, vice president, National Sales, Hyundai Motor America said. Good enough for you?   Good enough for you?Not really. It\\'s from 5 months ago.If you read the latest sales news from Ford, a quick search will take you to several of them, they are reporting that fleet sales are down 5% for either the year or the month of April, I can\\'t remember which it is. How then can one state that Fusion fleet sales are climbing when the supposed Sonata fleet reductios are being based on a 5 month old statement that groups the manufacturers total fleet sales together? Based on news that\\'s only days old we can say that Fusion fleet sales are falling I guess? See where I\\'m going?I know the Sonata is a great car, don\\'t get me wrong. But if the American manufacturers start producing great cars, such as the Fusion, someone else is going to lose some sales. Looks like Hyundai might be the first victim IMO.  never said that the Accord costs less - only that at least a good portion of the initial price difference is recovered at trade in time, that \\'false savings\\' I mentioned. Intellichoice 5 year cost of ownership is $2000 LESS for a 07 Accord LX vs. the 6s, but I rather suspect they are assumming a higher initial purchase price (for the 6) than what your actual experience was. From Intellichoice\\'s perspective, they would have no way to forecast how much money Ford needs to discount to sell the 6 (or the Fusion). In any case, total cost of ownership which obviously plays on resale values very heavily is every bit as important in evaluating a purchase as initial purchase price which may turn out to mean very little. Cheap now will almost always equal cheap later, and the reverse is also true. Lease rates tend to be indicative of what a car actually costs to own simply because new and residual values are both considered and assumes cars are both returned in excellent and low mileage conditions. Don\\'t have any numbers in front of me, but I might be willing to bet you lunch that the Accord (or Camry) would have about the same lease payment on let\\'s say a 3 year deal as would the 6, the Fusion or the Sonata.  I am very very sure of that - I own one in the slightly larger and heavier Avalon now 50k miles old . And you can cruise any forum you would like and find folks that can\\'t match EPA numbers, especially on the City side, on any car. In my case my 22/31 EPA turns into an honest 27 mpg overall. My wifes Altima 3.5 I think was rated at 18/27 and she ends up right at 25-26 overall although her hwy percentage is high, she is a little gentler than I on the accelerator, and the land down here in Texas is about as flat as those EPA laboratory floors. Which is the bottom line, if you really do spend much time in City gridlock and also enjoy mashing the accelerator on these wonderful new V6s, you will pay a price - this applies even to the 4 bangers. I would estimate that for the average driver in normal conditions the net cost between the 4 banger and V6 is likely going to be in the 3-4 mpg range overall and roughly correspondent to the EPA rating differences - meaning that those driver that can\\'t get close to EPA numbers on the V6 won\\'t on the 4 banger either! On the Camry specifically this translates into less than $20 a month assuming 1000 miles at $3 a gallon. Well worth it, IMO, if for no other reason than a \\'grins\\' factor   &#147;the numbers are wrong&#148;OK, to make sure we&#146;re on the same page, I&#146;ll take the Fusion V6 0-60 number from MT, and we&#146;ll look at C&D for the rest.Fusion V6 6A &#150; 7.2 sec, 21/29 mpg (MT)Altima I4 6M &#150; 7.2 sec, 24/31 mpg (C&D)Altima I4 CVT &#150; 7.4 sec, 23/29 mpg (C&D)Accord I4 5M &#150; 7.5 sec, 26/34 mpg (C&D)Accord I4 5A &#150; 8.1 sec, 24/34 mpg (C&D)Fusion I4 5M &#150; 8.1 sec, 23/31 mpg (C&D)Fusion I4 5A &#150; 8.8 sec, 23/30 mpg (est.)&#147;Your personal experience with the 5M in the Accord doesn\\'t really matter when we\\'re comparing auto trannies.&#148;Why can&#146;t we compare an I4 5M Accord with the V6 6A Fusion? Look at the numbers, Fusion is very close to the import 4\\'s. The manual-equipped Accord I4 is closer to the V6 Auto Fusion (0.3 seconds) than it is to the manual-equipped Fusion I4 (0.6 seconds). The Fusion V6 isn&#146;t available in a manual, and can&#146;t really be compared with other V6s as the automatic V6 versions of Accord, Camry and Altima are quicker by at least 0.6 seconds. It appears to me that the Fusion V6 is a very close match to the Altima 4 with either the 6-speed or the CVT and the manual Accord. The point was made that the V6 Fusion is considerably faster than competing 4-cylinders, and as the Accord 5M and Altima 6M and CVT show, that\\'s just not the case.Also, look at the Fusion 6A versus Accord 5M mileage penalty: 5 city and 5 highway! Those are EPA numbers, not even taking into account Edmund&#146;s forums posts of poor city mileage in late-model DT30s and posts of higher MPG in Accord I4&#146;s (my city average has been 28-29, and I don&#146;t drive lightly).So, it looks like choosing the V6 Fusion with the only available transmission (the 6A) over an I4 Accord with the 5M gives a less than 5% improvement in performance\\x85 but reduces fuel economy about 20%! At 15,000 miles per year, assuming gas stayes at $3, thats over $400 difference, or about $35 per month. That\\'s if gas stays at $3 per gallon...  That could very well be. With aggressive discounting by Ford/Mercury dealers on the Fusion and Milan (e.g. I recently saw a Milan advertised for under $15k) and the new, improved IIHS test scores for the Fulan plus positive reliability data from CR, they could very well be taking sales from the Sonata. Many people will choose an American brand over a foreign brand (especially one with a dearth of brand equity like Hyundai) without even trying the alternatives. Also there are Ford dealers in most small towns in the U.S.--not so with Hyundai dealers. For $15k, I would be very tempted to get a Milan over a Sonata if I were buying a mid-sized car right how.  What you \"said\" was:It is not generally good for...the car buyer...that they have to discount heavily.What is the intent of this, if not to imply that the cheaper car actually costs more?I\\'ve looked at intellichoice before and their data is just garbage...and not just based on my deal. They are more than $2300 too high on the initial price of the Mazda6. There has been $2000 in rebates available for at least 6 months, yet they have a \"target\" price of about $300 above invoice. This model can be bought effortlessly at invoice less rebates all day long. That site also can not account for the value of things like 0% financing that has been available from time-to-time on the Fusion.Based on looking at edmunds predicted resale values for the 6 and Accord, I agree that on a 3 year lease the net cost is probably nearly the same. I\\'d assume the Sonata and Fusion would be similar as well. At more than 3 years, though, I think the lower initial cost models would have lower net cost. My point is the higher resale value is not going to offset the higher initial cost. Therefore resale value should end up being non-issue for most.  Why can&#146;t we compare an I4 5M Accord with the V6 6A Fusion?Because you and I were originally comparing auto trannies. You threw a manual tranny Accord time in there saying it was for the 5A and it was way off. I\\'m also taking price into consideration. The V6 Fusion is more in line with an Accord I4 5A than the 5M when comparing an LX Accord to an SE Fusion. I\\'m leaving the Accord Value Package out of the mix because it is more or less a \"stripper\" model.I get your point about the Accord 5M but the fact is, many more buy the ATX. I would buy the 5M and you would buy the 5M but when I address a broader audience, like that on these forums, I like to stick with what I think the norm is. So yes the performance hit isn\\'t all that much with the Accord 5M but, given price to performance as the criteria, I can\\'t see too many people cross shopping that with the V6 Fusion since it comes only in ATX flavor. I also never like using numbers from different sources because there are too many variables that are different and can affect those numbers in big ways. So, if you average out the different times reported from different sources for the Fusion you get about 7.3 or 7.4 seconds. Agreed? That\\'s nearly 1 second faster than the Accord which is \"much faster\" in my book. I get fools trying to race my Mustang all the time so I am an expert in this field. :P  Just discovered this:http://www.edmunds.com/apps/calc/CalculatorControllerUsing their default values the Accord, Mazda6, Sonata and Fusion 36 mo. lease rates are all pretty close for the comparable versions I looked at. They are within about $5 per month of each other.However, using what I think is a more realistic initial price difference of $2500 between Mazda6 and Accord, the 6 came out about $50 per month less for the 4 cylinder versions that I compared...Accord SE vs. Mazda6 SVE. I also used 10,000 miles per year rather than the 15K default.  The calculator doesn\\'t take into account special lease deals. For example, right now there\\'s a $199/month special (I believe nationwide) on both the Accord LX and Sonata GLS. I\\'ve seen $199/month or a little less with no money down advertised locally on the Sonata GLS. The calculator says the lease on the Sonata is $389/month. Quite a difference.  Let\\'s agree to disagree. From a dead stop, a manual 4-cyl Accord will hold its own against an auto V6 Fusion. They are close enough that it would come down to a match between the average drivers. In my experience from driving both cars, it is easier to get a good launch in my Accord manual than the Fusion 6A because in the automatic it was harder to get the perfect launch with just the right amount of wheelspin, without abusing the car. With the V6 auto it was either too much gas or not enough; manuals are easier in my opinion.Interstate races are much harder to judge. Did you account for reaction time, and how do you know what gear the manual Accord was pulling, etc.? Here, automatics have an advantage for the average driver. Example, if you pull up next to me cruising 55mph on the interstate and floor it, your car will likely grab second gear at high RPM for a breif burst of acceleration, while I\\'ll hesitate to shift all the way down to second at that speed and fall behind.Baggs, the 7.9 second 0-60 time for the Accord I4 5A was posted on MSN Autos which frequently cites consumer reports. I agree, it is unusual for CR to get a better 0-60 time than C&D, but we are only talking about 0.2 seconds difference and that could have been testing conditions. Maybe C&D tested in CA at 75 degrees and CR tested in MA at 50 degrees. The 7.9 versus 8.1 second difference is minor, but I still took the slower C&D time instead. Besides, I\\'ll bet than when the new Accord 4-cylinder automatic is introduced later this year, it\\'ll run numbers similiar to the Altima, and both of them will be breathing down the Fusion\\'s neck. With four cylinders! And, any improvements to the Fusion appear to be pretty far off.But as I\\'ve said before, they are both good cars, I almost bought the Fusion.  I\\'ve seen that Accord deal, but I think there is money required upfront??? I think the Sonata one, otoh, may be a \"sign and drive\"???I\\'m not a leaser, so don\\'t know how those things really work, but I think the calculator maybe rolls eveything into the monthly payment??? Doubt that is enough to account for $190 per month difference, though.  Hyundai\\'s new Lambda V6s (3.3L & 3.8L) currently can be found in various Hyundai and Kia applications, including the Sonata. Competent engines and flexible, as the Lambdas can be tuned to as high as 300hp (which is a likely candidate on the base engine of the upcoming luxury RWD sedan next year).I sit corrected, the source I was using made the architecture look very similar.The Theta I4s also can be found in many Hyundai and Kia applications, including the Sonata. Don\\'t be confused, these are not the same as the GEMA engines. Hyundai is, however, receiving royalties for these I4s.So Hyundai has 2 2.4 liter 4 cylinder motors?  Did you read the links I posted earlier? Hyundai\\'s Theta engine, used in the Sonata and Optima, is partly based on but not the same as the GEMA engine used by DCX et. al.  Did you read the links I posted earlier? Hyundai\\'s Theta engine, used in the Sonata and Optima, is partly based on but not the same as the GEMA engine used by DCX et. al.Yeah I think I am confused because the GEMA sites say it was jointly developed, and on here it sounds like Hyundai made it and everyone is buying it from them.  You are not the first one to be confused by marketing hype vs. reality.  Hyundai didn\\'t make it; there is common technology, designed by Hyundai, which all the GEMA partners can use, and add their own tweaks to. An interesting fact from the article posted earlier is that the Hyundai Theta engine plant isn\\'t even part of GEMA, but the Theta engine does use block and intake technology from the GEMA project.  What is the intent of this, if not to imply that the cheaper car actually costs more? there is no intent or even any implication - simply that any car that is generally sold at big discounts will, in fact, have a lesser resale value down the road. That is not good for the buyer only in that it reduces how much he/she might recover for the vehicle at trade-in time. It has nothing to do with Fusions/6s/Sonatas or anything in particular, just a simple statement saying that cheaper up front generally equals cheaper later. It is no secret that Honda and Toyota are hard to deal with especially if you are expecting \\'Detroit\\' style discounts, but it is largely the reason why those cars tend to have high resale values - they cost more because they don\\'t negotiate much. The guy that really gets screwed is that guy that goes out and buys a car when it first comes out, pays something closer to sticker, only to see the mfgr. rebate or finance at 0% in some sort of EOY clearance sale thereby making that car thousands less than what he paid.Resale value should be a primary issue for any car buyer under the proviso that he/she is not likely to keep a car more than about 3 or 5 years. Resale value starts becomings a non-issue once that car accumulated a bunch of miles and more age than that. And yes there are a number of examples where a cheaper car at purchase can and doesreally cost more - all depending on those kinds of things.My point thru this whole thread is that folks all the time point to a car that let\\'s say costs them $3300.00 less new than Brand X or Brand Y, and then think they have actually saved all that money - to which I say \\'well, yes you did, and no, you didn\\'t.\\' And you are absolutely right, higher resale values will generally not offset the higher initial price (unless you bought a hybrid) and for whatever that real difference ends up being than that is really what it costs you to drive that Honda instead of something else - plus, of course, the time value of the extra money you had to borrow.  When comparing costs also take into account insurance and fuel.I comared a Mazda 6 to an Accord. The Accord was more expensive, but it saves $10 per month in gas and $10 per month for insurance.I bought the Accord, but if there was a 6 wagon with the 2.3 liter 4 I would have bought that. Love wagons.  \"The guy that really gets screwed is that guy that goes out and buys a car when it first comes out, pays something closer to sticker, only to see the mfgr. rebate or finance at 0% in some sort of EOY clearance sale thereby making that car thousands less than what he paid.\"That is one of the things that steered me from the Fusion to the Accord. When I saw that I could get an Accord for under invoice, I was pretty confident that was the rock-bottom price; it was as good as I would be able to get on an Accord. The new Accords will be out in a few months, the 07s will be gone, and we likely will not see such pricing on Accords again until the end of the next generations life cycle. There is very little chance that in a few years my resale value will be less because Honda will be selling them much cheaper.The Fusion had a larger discount, but there was no gaurantee that the deal I was seeing would not have been eclipsed by some larger rebates, or 0% financing, plus a free dell computer, and iPod, or who knows what else they\\'ll come up with to sell the things, and like captain said it\\'ll drive the resale down faster.That happened to me when I bought my last Ford, but I didn\\'t even pay anywhere near sticker! I thought I had a screamin\\' deal on my hands... paid invoice, less rebates, and got zero percent. The next year, the rebates doubled, zero percent financing was back, they had lowered the MSRP AND the invoice, and Ford had made standard some things which I had paid extra for. Guess what happened to my resale value?  Resale value should be a primary issue for any car buyer under the proviso that he/she is not likely to keep a car more than about 3 or 5 years.That is where you lose me. Honestly, I am trying to understand why you think resale value is so all important.If the net cost is less for the cheaper car or even if it is about the same, why buy something you don\\'t really want, just because the resale value is higher? For example, if after considering everything, excluding price and resale value, one likes the Fusion better than the Accord, why buy the Accord?  Resale value is unknown. There are three distinct possibilities:Scenario one: The Fusion continues to sell well for the next 5+ years, without having increased rebates or fleet sales. Also, the LONG TERM reliability proves to be on par with Honda (or Honda reliability falters). In this case, the Fusion will resale favorably compared to the Accord, and since it was less costly to purchase, will prove to be the better value. In the end, it really will cost more to drive a Honda, and the \"Japanese Myth\" theory is confirmed.Scenario two: The Fusion continues to sell fairly well for the next 5+ years, with minimal rebates and fleet sales. Long term reliability is not too far behind Honda. The difference in resale vales between the two cars will be roughly equal to the difference in their purchase prices when new, taking the time value of money into effect, making the resale issue a wash. No car is the better value than the other.Scenario three: (JUST ANOTHER SCENARIO) The Fusion doesn\\'t continue to sell as well through the next 5+ years; maybe Ford doesn\\'t update it enough, maybe the competition makes great leaps and bounds. In response to lower sales Ford increases rebates, and/or sells to fleets. OR, the LONG TERM reliability isn\\'t as good as Honda. The steep discounts on the future new Fusions, the older Fusions having reliability issues as they age, and used Fusions being dumped on the market at low prices, or any combination of those, come together to make a used Fusion worth considerably less than a similiar Honda. In that theoretical scenario, the resale difference between a Fusion and a Honda would be more than the difference in purchase price, making the Honda a better value. Like my last Ford, the costs of owning the Ford would be much greater than the costs of owning a competitor.Again, no one knows about future resale around or after 3-5 years from now.  no one knows about future resale around or after 3-5 years from nowabsolutely true - but what we do have is about 15 or 20 years of established history whether that be Ford\\'s history or Honda\\'s. Resale values as used in those \\'cost of ownership\\' studies are only estimates, even those residual values that are used to calculate lease costs are \\'estimates\\' on the lessors part. Tomorrow we might have the greatest en masse sequence of engine failures ever known to mankind, with every Honda 4 banger blowing head gaskets simultaneuously.  At that point, those particular cars will certainly have resale value problems, wouldn\\'t they? And every unfortunate Honda owner that happened to invest 20k or so of their hard earned money would experience a helluva financial loss, because now this car that they thought they could sell used for let\\'s say 10k is now only worth half of that. Kind of reminds me of GMs dubious flirtation with diesels back in the first energy (gas price) crisis. Those engines darn near did all blow up simultaneously, and just like magic those resale values went into the dumper.  why buy something you don\\'t really wantand all truths are self evident - you should never buy anything that you don\\'t really want.  Kind of reminds me of GMs dubious flirtation with diesels back in the first energy (gas price) crisis. Those engines darn near did all blow up simultaneously, and just like magic those resale values went into the dumper.The point being it was a crummy diesel, not that diesels are crummy. Mercedes and VW diesels have exceptionally high resale values, even still.As Honda and Nissan roll out their diesel mid-sized sedans, we will see who follows.  you\\'re making this comment to someone who really believes that the diesel/biodiesel will supplant the gasoline engine within the next 5-10 years - and of course, anything that is obscenely economical and durable will have great resale values. That small block V8 diesel I was talking about, was a little worse than merely \\'crummy; however.  Unless money means nothing to you, it is a good premise to strongly consider resale value of a car, if, and only if, you plan to keep the car equal to or less than 3 to 5 years. However in my case, I keep a car at least 10 years, sometimes much longer. Thus, resale value\\'s importance is less of an important factor in the purchase decision. My three last new car purchases were kept 22 years, 13 years, and 11 years respectively.  Why didn\\'t you include the Sonata? It\\'s sales are down 31% from last year at this time. See a trend? Also, Fusion sales to fleets are pretty low according to Ford and Hyundai just made some news about selling in high volumes to fleets IIRC. I just didn\\'t feel like looking them up. perhaps its (probably) just me buying into an old sterotype, but i don\\'t consider hyundai in the same leauge.  If you read the latest sales news from Ford, a quick search will take you to several of them, they are reporting that fleet sales are down 5% for either the year or the month of April, I can\\'t remember which it is.Maybe you forgot Ford removed Taurus fleet completely, so let\\'s think about this logically. Ford operated 100% of Taurus to fleet this time last year, and fleet sales YOY are only down by 5% even with the removal of Taurus fleet, you do the math. For a good part of 06, Taurus fleet led in Ford car sales monthly, ran normally from 15-20K units/month.  Resale value is unknown. There are three distinct possibilities: so true. One thing nobody has mentioned is the condition and mileage of the car. If you buy any car, put 45k miles a year on it, and trade it in after 3 years with 135k miles on it, you\\'re going to seriously hurt the resale value. I don\\'t car if its a honda, nissan, toyota, or bmw. You also have to consider the condition of the car. personally, if it knew I was going to be putting a lot of miles on a car, I\\'d buy a cheap as I could.But to me, the whole argument is moot. Your going to pay more for an asian car. Your going to pay more to buy it, pay more to maintain it, and pay more to fix it when it needs fixed. And if the dollar does\\'t strenghen against the yen, your either going to pay even more, or the asian car companies will continue to see their profits decline.  Unless money means nothing to you, it is a good premise to strongly consider resale value of a car, if, and only if, you plan to keep the car equal to or less than 3 to 5 years. However in my case, I keep a car at least 10 years, sometimes much longer. Thus, resale value\\'s importance is less of an important factor in the purchase decision. My three last new car purchases were kept 22 years, 13 years, and 11 years respectively.I think resale value is still important 10 or more years down the road. In 1992 the Taurus was the top rated car. I happened to buy a 92 Accord. After 12 years, and 140k miles, I decided to sell it and buy a new Accord. I sold the car in less than one hour for $1000 more than the KBB value ($5,000). Do you think I would have gotten close to that much for a 92 Taurus? I don\\'t think so. I also think an 07 Accord will still be worth considerably more in ten years, than an 07 Fusion will be.  if you found somebody to pay 5000 (or 6000 if you\\'re saying kbb was 5k) for a 12 year old car, consider yourself lucky. you found a moron who would have overpaid for anything.  \"it is a good premise to strongly consider resale value of a car, if, and only if, you plan to keep the car equal to or less than 3 to 5 years\"The key word is plan. Things happen. Say you buy a new car without considering resale value because you plan to drive it until the wheels fall off, but in the third year you accidentally total it. All of a sudden, resale value becomes very important. Say your cars value as determined by the insurance company is $8,200 while a competeting car in the same shape would have brought $11,400. It becomes an important factor again.Congratulations on keeping your cars for that long. You are a much wealthier person because of your restraint.  if you found somebody to pay 5000 (or 6000 if you\\'re saying kbb was 5k) for a 12 year old car, consider yourself lucky. The KBB on the car was actually $3,800. I sold it for $5,000. you found a moron who would have overpaid for anything.No, he would not have paid that much for \"anything\". He knew exactly what he was looking for. He wanted a dependable car for his daughter to drive to college in. He got exactly that.  paying 6000 for a 12yr old car with 150,000 miles on it is just stupid. at least when talking about a mid size family sedan. 6000 will buy you something 1/2 as old with half the miles on it.just the idea of paying kbb, let alone 1 grand over it, would make me question anybodies intelligence. paying 1k over KBB is about the same as going to a dealership and offering to pay more than msrp. If i were you, i would have tried to sell this person everything i own. As P.T. barnum said, there\\'s one born every second.  Maybe you forgot Ford removed Taurus fleet completely, so let\\'s think about this logically.Good point, and I did forget that. However my point was that the only proof I\\'ve seen so far of Sonata fleet sales being down is a 5-month old news article stating that all of Hyundai fleet sales are down. If that\\'s what we\\'re going by here, and without real numbers yet, then according to the latest news Fusion fleet sales are down too. While typing this I found the link  I was referring to. Turns out the numbers I saw are from mid-2006. Sonata fleet sales were just over 50% and Fusion fleet sales were 18.8%. Anyone know if the new numbers are actually closer now?  this just struck a(c)cord with me. my neighbor across the street had an accord that was in 3 major accidents. the first was when it was a few months old. based on what my neighbor told me, the insurance company wanted to total it, but he would not let them, so it got fixed. anyways, he put it out on the corner and some guy bought it for his daughter. when he was putting the plates on it, he gave me a look while i was mowing my lawn, like \\'i got a deal\\'.i really wanted to say something, but i didn\\'t. my point is, a lot of buyers of used cars don\\'t have a clue.  \"Wrong on both counts. Fusion fleets are actually going up as we speak\"Please prove this. you can\\'t because its not true. Ford does sell some Fusions to fleets but its much, much lower than at the levels of the Taurus. This is all over the net. And what about the Toyota fleet sales of the Camry??  paying 6000 for a 12yr old car with 150,000 miles on it is just stupid.Who said $6,000? Fact is, the car was well worth $5,000 and I would not have sold it for less. I still wonder if I made the right decision to sell it. The fact that I needed to have a truck, made selling the car a necessity.  \"Ford needs to discount to sell the 6 (or the Fusion). In any case,\"Ever thought Ford/Hyundia just decided to sell a great car at a great value and maybe Honda/Toyota are taking you for a ride? \"Cheap now will almost always equal cheap later, and the reverse is also true\" Cheap in what way? Or is this just because its a Ford product? N  \"From a dead stop, a manual 4-cyl Accord will hold its own against an auto V6 Fusion.\"No, it won\\'t.  \"That is where you lose me. Honestly, I am trying to understand why you think resale value is so all important.\"I agree. Honda folks love to tought resale value. Yet, they leave out the initial higher price paid, along with the higher interest over the lifetime of the loan..Cars are not an investment either...Another thing here. Resale on the internet is an average. Real world is where resales come in. I had a 2000 Accord LX and 3 dealerships wouldn\\'t give me more than 10,000 in 2004 for it! Perception to the public is also key on resale value. It has been bashed into our heads that Honda/Toyota are so much more reliable and they are \"worth it\". In my experience they are not. The internet has all kinds of information about reliability data. Get out and take a look. You will be surprised. :surprise:  According to the 12/1/06 statement pasted in #831, Hyundai started curtailing fleet sales dramatically in 11/06. If they established a new policy in November, they would not keep issuing the same press release month after month. While such monthly press releases wouldn\\'t be a \"5 month old new article\",they would certainly be \"old news.\" Hyundai added XM radio to Sonata\\'s built in late 2006. They had a press release about that. While they advertise that XM is included, they don\\'t issue press releases each month to announce that XM is included.  Honda/Toyota are so much more reliable and they are \"worth it\". In my experience they are notMy experience is the total opposite. My 2 Fords have been very weak compared to the satisfaction my 3 Hondas and 2 Toyotas deliver. Ford\\'s burned me twice. I doubt I\\'d ever buy one again. My 15 year old won\\'t see one in the driveway either. Leaning towards an Elantra.And I get \"out on the internet\". I don\\'t need it to tell me to steer clear of Ford.  My experience is the total opposite. My 2 Fords have been very weak compared to the satisfaction my 3 Hondas and 2 Toyotas deliver.I feel the same. Ford needs to step it up to earn my business. The Fusion seems to be an OK car, but its too new on the scene for it to be judged in the esteemed light of an Accord (yea I\\'m Honda-biased but for a good reason). Lets see how it holds together with 90,000 miles on it. The Aura looks good too, but how do we know what it\\'ll be like with 90,000 on it? I\\'m pulling for GM tho with its new models - the Aura, the new Malibu, and the new CTS. C\\'mon GM.  that\\'s weird, I got a quote on my insurance for an accord that was $150 more every 6 months compared to a mazda 6...and a civic SI was like $300 more every 6 months! Car insurance is just strange. Like a zip code where you live can have a big impact on insurance even if you park your car in a locked garage, while work addresses aren\\'t considered and cars there are out in the open. Ah well, what do you do?  The Honda is one of the most stolen cars in the USA. That\\'s likely why the higher insurance rates.  Dont you find it difficult driving a manual in stop and go driving. I personally hated it. Besides you can\\'t chat on the cell phone and drive if you drive a stick :P  Me: \"From a dead stop, a manual 4-cyl Accord will hold its own against an auto V6 Fusion.\" Scape: \"No, it won\\'t.\"Well, I\\'ve tried supporting my argument by stating that I have driven both cars and own one of them. However it seems we\\'ll have to take another look at some numbers. Car and Driver clocked the 2007 Accord I4 manual as having a very respectable 7.5 second 0-60 time, slightly slower than the new Altima 4. I couldn\\'t find much other data on 2006 and later (post engine power bump) Accord 4-cylinder manuals.The V6 Fusion automatic has plenty of test results available, however the results are all over the place. You are right, Motor Trend did clock one at 7.2 seconds, however there are many other credible sources that weren\\'t able to acheive that time. Please read the following excerpts:Edmunds.com, Full Test of SEL V6- 0-60 mph 8.0 sec, Notes: \"We achieved our best time doing a \"street start\" with the traction control turned off.\"NewCar.com- &#147;The 221-hp V6 engine provides enough power, although the Fusion will not likely be mistaken for a sports sedan. The Fusion can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in about 8 seconds, a reasonable performance though not as quick as the V6 versions of the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.&#148;Autoweek- &#147;In a straight line the Fusion turned in a respectable&#151;if average&#151;performance. Its 3.0-liter 221-hp V6 just edges the best our long-term Hyundai Sonata&#146;s larger 3.3-liter V6 could deliver, both to 60 mph (7.5 seconds vs. 7.51) as well as through the quarter-mile (15.7 seconds at 91.2 mph vs. 15.76 at 89.4).&#148;7.2 seconds? 8.0 seconds? 7.5 seconds? Even if you take the fastest time for the Fusion, versus the only time I found for the Accord, that\\'s only 0.3 seconds difference. Between a 2.4L four, and a 3.0L six that has an extra gear! The results indicate to me that it would be a well-matched street race. Oh wait, I already did that myself (versus its sister car), and won. Seems to me like somebody just doesn\\'t want to admit that a 4-cylinder Accord can keep up with his V6...  Ever hear of \"bluetooth\"? anyhow driving and chating is illegal in a bunch of states including mine and doesn\\'t need an official proclaimation, for me anyhow, to be avoided.  According to the 12/1/06 statement pasted in #831, Hyundai started curtailing fleet sales dramatically in 11/06. If they established a new policy in November, they would not keep issuing the same press release month after month. While such monthly press releases wouldn\\'t be a \"5 month old new article\",they would certainly be \"old news.\" I\\'m not looking for another press release. I\\'m looking for numbers!!!!!!!A lot can change in 5 months which is why that press release is worthless. Hyundai also isn\\'t going to release a statement to the press that they\\'ve increased fleet sales either. I go along with them having lowered Sonata fleet sales but they were selling ove 50% of them to fleets as of July 2006. I doubt the big drop in Sonata sales is a result of them cutting fleet sales by the same amount. Let\\'s be realistic here. :sick:  if you found somebody to pay 5000 (or 6000 if you\\'re saying kbb was 5k) for a 12 year old car, consider yourself lucky. you found a moron who would have overpaid for anything. While I agree that it is nuts to pay $5000 for a 12 year old car with 150K miles, I don\\'t think you are correct about the person being willing to overpay for anything. I imagine that there are a lot of people who believe that a 12 year old accord with 150K miles is more \"reliable\" than a 5 year old Taurus with 60K miles. In fact, I bet in many people\\'s view the age and mileage does not even enter into their evaluation of this...they would figure a 1992 Accord with 250,000 miles on it is more \"reliable\" than a brand new Fusion.  Hate to jump into a series of posts arguing aceleration numbers because they are largely irrelevent due to a hundred factors e.g. driver...mechanical condition..reflexes (in a street race)..road surface condition...is it your car as opposed to a rental etc. Some of the few times I really CARE about having a fast car involve a quick pass on a two lane with oncoming traffic and the passee speeding up and I\\'ve passed \"bingo\". A quick entry onto an interstate with two Peterbuilts..one in each lane..bearing down on me @ about 75 mph. Those plus the occasional \"pull away\" from a tailgater.That said, I prefer a V-6 to a 4 and buy the larger V-6 if two of those are available. I am of the \"better to have it and not need it\" school of thought. Anyhow, what I wanted to say was Autoweek has the absolute slowest numbers I have ever seen for a V-6 Sonata both 0-60 and 1/4 mile  The Honda is one of the most stolen cars in the USA. That\\'s likely why the higher insurance rates.That\\'s silly. Ever think that the sheer number of Accords out there has anything to do with its target for thiefs? My insurance agent says the Accord is one of the CHEAPER cars to insure.  My insurance agent says the Accord is one of the CHEAPER cars to insure. Maybe that\\'s because they are getting all those stolen body parts cheap  .Seriously though, insurance costs vary. For me, my insurance agent has said for any car I have the liability will cost the same with my insurance company. He tells me for collision it varys a little based on the cost of body parts. I think he said generally import body parts would be more expensive. I think he may have also said that some cars have alternate body part suppliers, with lower prices. Since the Accord and Mazda6 are built here they should be toward the cheaper end along with other models that are asembled in North America. Accord might be so common that there are alternate suppliers.In the end, for me the make and model of the vehicle has little impact on determining my auto insurance rate. Apparently this is not the case for everyone, though.BTW, Mada6 made #2 and Accord #6 on the cheap to insure list here at edmunds:http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/list/top10/110137/article.html  Oh I agree with you about there being a hundred factors which influence acceleration numbers. I only got started on the whole debate because someone made the blanket statement that Fusion V6 was \"much faster\" than competing 4-cylinders. That\\'s simply not the case for Accord manual and Altima manual and CVT, they are right there with the Fusion V6. Car and Driver clocked a 2.5L manual Altima at 7.2 seconds, matching the best time I\\'ve seen for a Fusion (the Motor Trend test).  I go along with them having lowered Sonata fleet sales but they were selling ove 50% of them to fleets as of July 2006. I doubt the big drop in Sonata sales is a result of them cutting fleet sales by the same amount.Hmmm, interesting correlation. I think you may be on to something here!I think there\\'s a few factors behind the drop in Sonata sales:* HMA\\'s decision to reduce fleet sales.* A big increase in Santa Fe sales over last year; Santa Fes are made in the same plant as Sonatas, so if they can sell a higher-priced Santa Fe vs. a Sonata, which would they choose?* Reduction in Sonata incentives compared to last year.* General slowness in the auto industry coupled with stronger competition this year vs. last year (e.g. new Camry, new Aura, big incentives on Accords and Mazda6\\'s, improving reputation for Fulan), combined with no major changes to the Sonata since its introduction two years ago. It\\'s no longer the \"fresh-faced kid on the block.\"  Dont you find it difficult driving a manual in stop and go driving.Wow, why do you live in a miserable place with stop and go traffic? Why don\\'t you live closer to work? I personally hated it. Besides you can\\'t chat on the cell phone and drive if you drive a stickMaybe if you didn\\'t have a boring car and lots of \"stop and go traffic\" you would actually enjoy driving and not want to talk on the phone :P  I only got started on the whole debate because someone made the blanket statement that Fusion V6 was \"much faster\" than competing 4-cylinders.It wasn\\'t a blanket statement originally. I was comparing an ATX to an ATX. You made it into an ATX vs MTX argument and you are right about that as I pointed out. However, your 0-60 times for the Accord 5A were just plain wrong and the Fusion V6 is a much better performer than the Accord I4 5A. Plus they are really, really close in price. .8 to 1 second difference is big no matter how you slice it.Those of you who have bought an Accord I4 5M are getting quite a performance deal because it is nearly every bit as quick as a Fusion V6 for $1k or $2k less. But I don\\'t imagine many of you do have an Accord with that drivetrain so my point still applies to the vast majority.Oh I agree with you about there being a hundred factors which influence acceleration numbers.A lot of people don\\'t get that though. If the two weren\\'t tested on the same track, on the same day, and with the same driver, then it\\'s hard to believe any comparison of numbers.  Here\\'s the link: dzelinski, \"Subaru Legacy/OutbackTransmission Problems\" #45, 11 May 2007 7:25 am.  Agreed, on nearly all points. That Accord I4 5A time was probably fast by 0.2 seconds. A few things to consider, regarding the ATX to ATX argument: Altima 2.5L CVT is very nearly as quick as the fastest test of a Fusion V6 ATX. Also, I suspect the 2008 Accord (with the new A-VTEC engines and resulting power increases) will be able to match the Altima, closing the gap to the Fusion unless Ford has some new tricks. A-VTEC promises to increase economy as well, where the Accord already has a distinct advantage (I am seeing 28-29 city and 34-38 highway).  Dont you find it difficult driving a manual in stop and go driving. I find it quite easy to drive a stick in stop and go traffic. I actually prefer it to an automatic because I can anticipate and coast. And I\\'ve spent a lot of time in that kind of traffic. :sick:  Accord (with the new A-VTEC engines and resulting power increases) will be able to match the Altima, closing the gap to the Fusion unless Ford has some new tricks.Well, that brings us back to the whole origin of this and other conversations I\\'m trying to clear up here. The new PIP D30 engine for the Fusion and Escape will, if all the news on Ford forums are correct, have more horsepower and better fuel economy with no hit in price.A CVT is a completely different animal but it is the closest thing to an ATX Nissan offers in the Altima right now so I\\'d say that\\'s fair to compare too. 99% of Freestyle owners I\\'ve come across say it has plenty of power for them with the CVT (which is gone for the Taurus X and D35 motor BTW) and that\\'s a heavy vehicle with a relatively weak engine. So something good has to be going on in a CVT. I\\'ve never driven a CVT equipped vehicle, so I can\\'t attest to the magic they perform.   \"Dont you find it difficult driving a manual in stop and go driving. I personally hated it. Besides you can\\'t chat on the cell phone and drive if you drive a stick\"When I used to live in an area that had rush hour I still preferred a manual. Now the nearest town with any kind of traffic congestion is about 200 miles away. I go years at a time between waiting more than one cycle for a light. :P As far as cell phones go the Accord is quiet enough that I can just put it on speaker. Love the drivetrain in the I4 manual. Nice and quick, but still give Focus like fuel economy (or better). My lifetime mpg is 31.3 for my Accord, and 40 mpg is obtainable on the highway - 35 mpg under poor conditions. Still, I was another that looked at the Fusion. It is a nice drive, but the dash and switch gear are below my 1990 Acura, seemed a little more cramped than the Accord, and mpg was not there. I also wish they made a wagon.  also wish they made a wagon.Yeah that ruled out the Accord and others the last go around, but this time the car is for me so the needs are different.  If Hyundai cut back on its fleet sales by 60%, their April \\'07 sales of 10,434 would have had 8347 retail sales and 2087 fleet sales. Using your 50% figure, April, \\'06 sales would have been 7858 retail & 7858 fleet.Cutting back fleet sales to a total of 20% is not unrealistic. :P  if all the news on Ford forums are correct, have more horsepower and better fuel economy with no hit in pricewhen Toyota developed the new 3.5 2GR they did it with a savings of $1000.00 per engine and picked up 80 hp,a coupla mpgs in the process, and did it with enough (US) plant capacities to use it in about every car that Toyota and Lexus makes. That Ford should be \\'rewarded\\' \\'by a hit in price\\' is silly. For what, maybe making an engine that is borderline competitive, 5 years too late? I only hope that they can figure out how to take out whatever it is that makes the engine so rough sounding and harsh feeling. Even the (new?) DT3.5 has been getting some mixed reviews in that dept.  I also wish they made a wagon.I think the Edge is essentially the Fusion wagon.  Good point assuming those are Sonata numbers. I guess I was figuring on the sales numbers to be higher for some reason.The key word in your proposal is \"if\" though. Did Hyundai cut Sonata fleet sales back by 60%? I\\'m not saying they didn\\'t, but did they? History would tell us that they didn\\'t.  That Ford should be \\'rewarded\\' \\'by a hit in price\\' is silly.I never said there would be a hit in price. I have no idea what the price will be and neither does anyone else at this point. I\\'m guessing they won\\'t raise the price when the new version of the engine comes out.I only hope that they can figure out how to take out whatever it is that makes the engine so rough sounding and harsh feeling.Mazda did but I don\\'t know that Ford will. when Toyota developed the new 3.5 2GR they did it with a savings of $1000.00 per engine and picked up 80 hp,a coupla mpgs in the process, and did it with enough (US) plant capacities to use it in about every car that Toyota and Lexus makes. This isn\\'t the right place for this, but Ford, GM, DCX, and Toyota plants are not of the same breed. Ford is now finally converting it\\'s plants to support flexible manufacturing which will also lower re-tooling costs and time. Right now that\\'s just not the case. Did you read that article I posted about the PIP D30? It is going to take them a little over a year to re-tool the Cleveland engine plant #2 to prpcude that engine. Toyota does not have to deal with such downtime because their plants are much newer.FWIW, the other DT35 engine plants are set up to switch between building the DT35 and DT37 variants with little or no downtime as I understand it. They are taking their sweet old time with the new engine but I think we can all agree that they have to to get it right. And should.  \"I think the Edge is essentially the Fusion wagon. \"Yes true, but the 4-cyl is borderline for mpg. The V-6 just uses way too much fuel, and I require a stick shift. I am also not interested in the whole crossover thing - just a regular wagon with all the advantages of a sedan, but more room.  Mazda did but I don\\'t know that Ford will.having never driven a 6 but obviously with a lot of bad taste in my mouth for the Ford DT3.0- correct me if I\\'m wrong, - except for the blown 4 banger, Ford and Mazda drivetrains are identical, even to the point of coming out of that same Ohio factory? Ford can\\'t do what it wants or needs to do because of some nasty labor contracts as well as horrendous losses in the last few years. Toyota can do and did obviously what it needed to for pretty much the opposite reasons. It takes money to make money, and Toyota sure has beaucoups of that. If it takes Ford another year or two to get a lousy 240hp V6 out, it will be too late, as usual and the Fusion (so equipped) will be a market afterthought - if it isn\\'t already.Remember that when the 500 came out hampered by the same engine, Ford promised then that they would have a better engine for it for the 06 model. Didn\\'t happen, of course and now even the renamed Taurus which was promised for last month, is still not here. Promises come from the sales depts., real cars are what the bean counters allow to be built.  The key word in your proposal is \"if\" though. Did Hyundai cut Sonata fleet sales back by 60%? I\\'m not saying they didn\\'t, but did they? History would tell us that they didn\\'t.That history you speak of would be the purposeful program Hyundai had for a good part of 06 on the Sonatas. Aside from that, Hyundai\\'s fleet figures are average at best. The purpose of the Sonata program, and I\\'m paraphrasing Hyundai officials\\' words - to get as many butts in the Sonata as possible Most automakers do not have fleet/retail split model-by model readily available, and for good reasons  But, I will try to see if I can get confirmation from one of my buddies who works for Polk. For now, based on my conversations with various industry professionals, Sonata fleet units have been reduced since the purposeful program ended, while Fusions went up.  Didn\\'t happen, of course and now even the renamed Taurus which was promised for last month, is still not here. Promises come from the sales depts., real cars are what the bean counters allow to be built.I thought the new (2008?) Taurus (nee Five Hundred) was supposed to get the 3.5-liter V6. No? I though I also read where FoMoCo\\'s bean counters were going to be shoved into the background for a change. No?Boz  \"I think the Edge is essentially the Fusion wagon. \"Yes true, but the 4-cyl is borderline for mpg. The V-6 just uses way too much fuel, and I require a stick shift. I am also not interested in the whole crossover thing - just a regular wagon with all the advantages of a sedan, but more room.ditto. But I know I am not typical and I would say others on this forum, just by the fact that they are here, are not typical either.I am less excited about added vehicle height and center of gravity, reduced maneuverability, and harder entry and exit for children.  yes, the only thing I\\'ve seen on the 3.5 engined 500 are car show photos and a promised April 07 date as apparently an 08 model. In the meanwhile dealers continue to give away 500s off their lots at $5000.00+ discounts. The Five Hundred, IMO, is in much the same situation as the Fusion, a good overall design courtesy of somebody else, but both saddled with an outdated powertrain. Whether the bean counters are now in the background, I don\\'t know, but it sure doesn\\'t seem like it. And I\\'m also not so sure that the \\'Taurus\\' name will solve any problems either - a car that had a good name 10 or 15 years ago, that quickly degenerated into the definition of a rental car.  but it sure doesn\\'t seem like it. And I\\'m also not so sure that the \\'Taurus\\' name will solve any problems either - a car that had a good name 10 or 15 years agoIn the end, the taurus didn\\'t have that good of a name. the last few years it was arround, ford pretty much neglected it, and its reliability ratings kept dropping, along with its sales. thats why ford canned it. but, the replacements (fusion/500) combined sales are even less than the taurus was in its last year. which is why they want to try and bring it back.  So something good has to be going on in a CVT. I\\'ve never driven a CVT equipped vehicle, so I can\\'t attest to the magic they perform. I wouldn\\'t call it magic, its just more efficent. it\\'s kind of like comparing and overhead cam setup with a pushrod/lifter one, or fuel injection to carburation. there\\'s less moving parts, so less loss of energy. I\\'d be willing to bet the difference in the alti 0-60 time (and other speed tests) is entirely because of that. and on a separate note, with a lot less moving part, and generaly simpler design, repair/replacement costs are much lower.  I\\'m pulling for GM tho with its new models - the Aura, the new Malibu, and the new CTS. C\\'mon GM.  I think GM will be alright. the impala seems like a good car that is selling well. with the addition of the impala ss, it should only improve. Also, the aveo seems to be doing fairly well. I actualy see as many of them a i do yaris\\'s. that gives GM a dominant position in truck/suv\\'s, and a competitive midsize and sub-compact. If they can just come up with a decent compact (cobatl doesn\\'t impress me)and a crossover or two, they should be fine.  Spy Shots  I think the 2007 looks better  \"I think the 2007 looks better\" I wouldn\\'t say that my 2007 looks \"better,\" but I don\\'t have to worry anymore about seeing a new 2008 and feeling buyers remorse for not waiting. They are both nice looking cars. I wonder what the interior looks like. Judging from the shot of the coupe with the door open, it might have those uncomfortable side armrests like the new Camry (slanted and sloped with a big grab handle).  This looks to be a low-end model. Note the cloth seats, modest tires, and lack of a sunroof. One tailpipe indicates the 4-cylinder model.Notice, there\\'s no body-side moulding. I like the door handles, they seem sculpted to a design, not just basic handles.  Before I say this, don\\'t get me wrong. I think the car looks fine, I think the 2007 is a very nice looking car, and I have absolutely nothing against honda:but, the three things I don\\'t like about the 2008 are1. the tail. I don\\'t know if its shorter, or lower or what, but doesn\\'t look as good to me as the 2007. The most notable of it, the tail lights. I always thought that made the accord\\'s rear end look much better, the triangular taillights.2. the headlights. hard to tell exactly, but look like the stick out from the fender.3. the door pannels look flat. no creases or design to them. kind of plain jane looking.I know its just a couple of spy shots, but thats my impression.  Overall, I think I like it. But...the front end reminds me a little of a Saturn L series, the side of a BMW 5 series, and the rear pillar of an Altima. Not bad. The grill seems tacky and cheap--black plastic of a not particularly pleasing shape. Like a Fusion without the chrome. Frankly, I think the current Fusion may be a nicer looking car, because it\\'s more coherent and less fussy. But my guess is that in terms of performance and quality, the Accord may have the edge.  having never driven a 6 but obviously with a lot of bad taste in my mouth for the Ford DT3.0- correct me if I\\'m wrong, - except for the blown 4 banger, Ford and Mazda drivetrains are identical, even to the point of coming out of that same Ohio factory?I will correct you. The Mazda version of the DT30 in the Mazda6 V6 has a Mazda exclusive VVT system and uses different heads and intake among other things. It is quite smooth when compared to a Ford DT30. I have not driven a Honda or Toyota lately so I can\\'t compare unfortunately.The motor is mfd in the same plant as the Ford DT30s but it is different in several key ways. I have to wonder if the PIP D30 motor I speak of is in fact some newer version of that Mazda V6 as the next Mazda6 will get the DT35, and a good bit of length added, from what has been printed several times. If it has an MTX it might be quite appealing.of course and now even the renamed Taurus which was promised for last month, is still not here.Where on earth did you hear that? Ford\\'s official press release from the Chicago auto show states summer availability.  Not sure what everyone is commenting on. All I see are 3 boxes with red X\\'s in them.   and isn\\'t captain\\'s impression of the DT30 based on the Ford Five Hundred, a car that weighs 500 pounds more than the fusion or 6? If I remember correctly, his comments from several months ago were about a different car that may or may not have similar characteristics as the Fusion or the 6. Try driving a Honda Pilot or Nissan Xterra and tell me you can\\'t hear that the engine is stressing a bit more pulling all that extra weight compared to the sedans with similar engines. To give you an idea of how smooth the mazda6 engine is, today I accidentally drove about 10 miles in 4th going around 70mph before noticing and shifting up to 5th. 4k+ rpms does sound more aggressive in the mazda, but the thing is, I WANT IT TO SOUND LIKE THAT WHEN I REV IT UP THAT HIGH. Passionate driving should involve your senses; what you hear influences what you feel. If you exceed 4k rpms, you\\'re doing it for a reason, and an aggressive sound simply is expressing your intentions. But when I want to be serene and smooth, I will keep the engine below 4k and get comments from people like my uncle who drives a lexus saying that they are surprised at how quiet the Mazda 6 is.That, to me, is one of the great things about the 6...it can be quite civil when you want it, but when you\\'re in the mood for fun, it has great grip and balance through curves, amazing brakes along with an engine that propels the car nicely. Oh yeah, for 5k less than an Accord.  try this link:link titleyeah, not too impressed with the sedan. the profile looks a bit too generic still. in some ways it reminds me of the Sonata from the side view. I do like the front though, especially the headlights. I wonder if they will have that TL type line down the side like the coupe had... one thing though notice the last pic of the front quarter of the accord with the older accord behind it? and notice the last car in that same picture has the same wheels as the 08 accord coupe in it\\'s spy shot? looks like they are doing some comparing the old vs the new.  The wife and I bought a 2007 SEL AWD V6 6-speed automatic Fusion on Dec. 4, 2006. The MSRP was $27,105. Other than the standard SEL equipment and the AWD, it has heated leather seats, anti-lock brakes, and a moon roof.My wife refused to consider Asian cars and the only one I was really interested in was the Honda Accord. My question is: How much Accord could I have gotten for $27,105? A V6? Moon roof? AWD is not available, of course. The Fusion comes in three models, the S, SE and SEL and there is a choice of two engines, the 160-horsepower I4 2.3 liter with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. The 3.0-liter V6 only comes with a 6-speed automatic.My wife and I, to some extent, believed the Accord to be priced out of our range for the options we wanted and the standard SEL features on the Fusion (too numerous to list all).This car has been delightful so far, 3,000 miles and no squeaks or rattles, no breakages, nary a problem EXCEPT for very poor (14.8 average) in-city gas mileage. Unfortunately, 95 percent of our driving in in the city, stop-and-go, short hops.I am having second thoughts now. I am wondering how much Accord can be bought for $27,105. The Fusion\\'s bold, distinctive styling and superior handling qualities were big selling points as was having a top-notch Ford, Lincoln, Mercury dealer, Sherwood of Salisbury, Md.Granted, now is not a good time to go shopping but I might be in the market for an Accord within a year or so.  Sounds to me like you got your fusion fully loaded. an accord fully loaded would have problby run you about 32k.  Yeah, JD, everything but Sirius radio, navigation system and the audiophile sound system. Our radio is the premium version though, with 6 CD player and six speakers (eight on the audiophile version). Those missing options are not something that we would order. Then again, neither is the AWD.32K for a fully loaded Accord? That\\'s steep in my book. Plus the Honda dealer is only so-so, carries too many other brands. Has a mini conglomerate.Thanks for the reply. Our fully loaded Fusion will be just fine for awhile. I was afraid that the Accords were priced like that.  Check the Accord prices paid forum right now. The most I can find anyone paying for an EX-L V6 Accord with Navigation (not avail on Fusion yet) is $26k or so. That is the most Accord you can buy. You\\'d be hard pressed to spend $27k for an Accord unless you just didn\\'t shop around much.People are paying $1,000-$2,000 under invoice for Accords. The reason is the more 2007 models dealers sell now, the more highly profitable 2008s they will be alotted.  The only Accord that may cost 32k is the hybrid V6. I think you could get any other Accord for 27-28k easy.  The Accord EX-L might be a good fit for you. With today\\'s incentives, you could probably get one for under $23k. It has leather, moonroof, and alloys. Its I4 is peppy and all that you need for 95% in-town driving, and it will deliver a lot better fuel economy than a V6.If you are serious about being in the market for an Accord soon, you might be able to take advantage of model close-out pricing that is likely this fall once the all-new 2008 Accords roll out. But you would take a bath on your Fusion, just as you would selling any car that is less than a year old. If you can find a hungry Honda dealer this fall, maybe they would trade you straight up for a 2007 Accord EX-L, and if you are really lucky maybe one with nav.  The only Accord that may cost 32k is the hybrid V6. I think you could get any other Accord for 27-28k easy. I checked my local dealers website, and the highest they had was 31,700. I wasn\\'t just pulling a number out of the air. But that was fully loaded with a nav system. Yes, they had a lot of accords cheaper, but it looked to me like the poster spent about as much as you can on a fusion, so I specificly looked for the most someone could spend on an accord.and no, it wasn\\'t a hybrid   The MSRP for the Accord EX-L V6 with Navi and Destination is $29,995, so that dealer had a bunch of added junk that doesn\\'t really add to the value of the car. That, or the dealer is crooked.  of course he is. they all are  The MSRP for the Accord EX-L V6 with Navi and Destination is $29,995but actually, its not listed as an ex-l v6. something called an accord ex-l auto ULEV with navi  27k will buy the Accord V-6 6MT loaded. It quite fast (5.9 to 60) and gets pretty good gas mileage EPA 21/30.If you need traction in the winter snow tires will do more than AWD - after all they will help you stop, and not being able to stop is more likely to get you in trouble.  Actually, dudleyr, we didn\\'t shop for Accords because we figured a loaded one with a V6, moonroof and leather seats would cost around $30,000. Our Fusion has all of the bells and whistles except for navigation and Sirius, which don\\'t interest us. I wouldn\\'t have ordered AWD either, the car just came that way on the lot.In retrospect, we bought the Fusion too fast. But $27,000 MSRP, before the dealing, was our absolute maximum (paid cash and traded in a 2000, one-owner, Mazda Miata with 7,500 original miles on it. ($8,000 trade-in.)Given our city driving habits, 95 percent, we should have gone with an I4. The Fusion\\'s 14.8 mpg city is a killer.Thanks to all who have weighed in on this topic, \"How much Accord.\" Hindsight is always 20-20. The SEL is a nice package though. We especially like the piano black dash, no plood, and the fit and finish is perfect on our car.  \"...traded in a 2000, one-owner, Mazda Miata with 7,500 original miles on it.

Seven thousand miles???D&#\\\\!~, I wish that I would have been standing there to buy that from you for 80 bones.True. 7,500 miles and looked like new. My mother bought the car new in 2000 when she was 81 years old. Drove it to church, the grocery store, the beauty shop. Oil changed every six months. She never had the top down. After she got side-swiped by a semi I took away her driver\\'s license and kept the car for about six months before trading it on the Fusion. It was a sweet machine but a true sports car in every sense. Not a practical car and the smallness of it scared me. The side-swipe accident did $2,000 damage. It had been repaired when we traded it. Kelley Blue Book range on the car was $8,000 to $10,000. I thought the $8,000 was a fair price. Maybe I should have held out for more or offered it in a private sale. Hindsight is 20-20. My wife and I both like the Fusion more than the Miata convertible.  google navigation+depreciation. then see how you feel about it as a built in feature.  I\\'m not \"pro-built-in-nav,\" and if it seemed that way, I misspoke. I have the portable unit (for around $300) and love the fact that I can use it in unlimited different vehicles. Built-in units cost MUCH more than that, and while often coming with other neat features, the fact that it is only useful in that car limits its \"help\" factor.I just wrote about the Accord with Navi because even the Navi-equipped Accord would be less than the $27k our Fusion-buying friend mentioned. Unfortunately, it appears he didn\\'t know about the incentives, or the MPG penalty AWD would beckon. He got a nice car though. For me, I have a hard time paying for satellite radio, leather, or built-in Navigation (hence the reason my car has none of that). I would, however, love to see the 2008 Accord offer automatic climate control on some cloth-equipped models. It\\'s not a big deal, but an area where I\\'d like to see a change.  Hmm. I actually HATE the current Accord sedan and coupe. I kind of like the \\'08s though. I\\'m not ready to drop everything and buy one but they are nicer. Two things I notices right off the bat. The head and tail lights seem to jut out from the body, on the side, which is one thing I don\\'t really like. Looks sloppy to me and the last gen Camry head lights were like that too. The other thing is the grille. It appears to be covered in black tape on the mule. I\\'m guessing the production version will show that there\\'s a three-bar chrome grille under that black tape. At least on the EX anyway. Wonder where that idea came from. :P One more thing. The profile kind of looks like a BMW 3-series in a way. Low hood, high greenhouse, slightly lower trunk, but without the goofy \"Bangle butt\".  Interesting article comparing 25 midsize and large sedans costing less than $21,000.  Thanks for the link. Their reviews are much better written than another purported consumer oriented magazine. They seem to real world.They match exactly what I saw in a neighbor\\'s visiting brother\\'s Camry. They also have large sedan reviews. Azera tops the list.  Thought you ought to know that IFCAR is a car research institute consisting of one auto junkie. Nevertheless, I like his evaluation tables.  Very interesting reviews, rhduke00. Thanks for the link. I learned something. It was interesting that the 4-cylinder Fusion finished 4th while the V6 Fusion finished 14th.As the owner of a 2007 V6 SEL AWD Fusion, I would have to agree with that assessment. We should have ordered an I4 SEL rather than taking what was on the lot. We get horrific in-city gas mileage, 14.8 mpg, and don\\'t need the power of a V6 because 95 percent of our driving is in-city. Hindsight is always 20-20. We bought power we don\\'t need. The same is true for the All-Wheel-Drive. Both are expensive options. Our SEL had a MSRP of $27,105. An I4 SEL would have been a much better deal.Again, thanks for the link, even though it reinforces our buyer\\'s remorse.   I just wrote about the Accord with Navi because even the Navi-equipped Accord would be less than the $27k our Fusion-buying friend mentioned. Unfortunately, it appears he didn\\'t know about the incentives, or the MPG penalty AWD would beckon. He got a nice car though.Graduate,Actually I did know about the AWD penalty. The original EPA in-city estimate on the window sticker was 19 mpg, which I could live with. Believing that was my first mistake.Since then, the EPA has revised its estimate for this power train downward to 17 mpg city. I could live with that, too. It\\'s the 14.8 mpg that we are getting in city driving that is killing me.Bottom line: We should have ordered an SEL with an I4, either manual or automatic, instead of buying what was on the lot. I didn\\'t think the I4 would be powerful enough but, according to numerous posts on various forums, it would have been just fine for our purpose.   Interesting that of the top 8 cars, there\\'s two Kia Optimas, two Hyundai Sonatas, two Fords (Fusion and Five Hundred), the Aura, and the Accord. I think it reinforces how competitive this class is and that if people bother to look beyond the \"automatic\" choices of Accord and Camry (and maybe Altima), there\\'s several very good cars and good values in this class.  That\\'s a very good point, Backy. I also found it interesting that the Fusion placed fourth (the I4) and fourteenth (the V6). The reviewer obviously places more value on the four cylinder models. Indeed, we now wish we had ordered an I4 SEL Fusion rather than buying a V6 off the lot.Your point about the diversity in this mid-size sedan class is well-taken. I really wish we had been able to read this information before we decided. We would have saved several thousand dollars and been better satisfied to boot.  Accord still #1.   Thank-you!! I have been saying this all along and now another person comes along and shows folks, Accords are thousands more than like optioned Fusions/Milans/Sonata\\'s.. This is common knowledge.. :surprise:  No you didn\\'t buy the Fusion too fast. Don\\'t let the Honda crowd get to you. You have a very well built vehicle at a good price. The Fusion fit/finish is every bit as good as an Accord or Camry. When I shopped last year the Ford salesperson was so confident he took the Fusion to both a Honda lot and a Camry lot to show me first hand face to face, side by side comparison. I had 4 - 5 sales people walking, poking, opening/shutting doors ect around these cars looking at every detail. I am totally confident the Fusion will easily hold up over 100,000 miles. In fact.I just got back from a trip to Idaho in my Fusion. I wanted to post this so badly!! I traveled with my whole family. 2 Adults, 2 children, soccer gear/luggage. I averaged 75MPH and got 32.6 MPG!! This is 3MPG better than Ford advertises. I as extremely happy. The car handled like it was on rails through the mountains, and drove with confidence. You made a great choice in buying a Fusion. :shades:  Thank-you for posting this!! so much! Yet another reason why the Fusion is a great value and a great vehicle. It finishes within points behind the Accord. Some here make it seem as if the Fusion is miles behind the Accord when look yet again! Its not. Take a look at the pricing difference. http://ifcar.net/reviews.comparisons.inexpensivefamilysedans.htm  Good read!I was certainly surprised to see the Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima tying for first place, and well deserved too.EDIT: Just noticed the Hyundai Azera took the first place as well in the large sedan category. Kudos!!  \"Accord still #1. \"Did you read the article? Nope the Accord is #3.. :confuse:  You made a great choice in buying a Fusion. Nobody seems to be saying otherwise. Instead, that they bought the wrong Fusion for his/her needs. 14 MPG when they don\\'t need V6 power or AWD is pretty sad, when the 2.3L Fusion would\\'ve sufficed. Out of curiousity, do you realize that it IS ok for people to disagree with you and it not be personal? There always seems to be a chip on your shoulder. Sure, the Fusion will hold up 100,000 miles, as should any car on the market today. Anyone saying otherwise is just trying to push your buttons. I\\'m glad you got above EPA numbers on your trip. I just got back in my Accord and did similarly to you! 36 MPG, 75 MPH (through the Ozark Mountains), 100% A/C use. 2 MPG better than EPA with 700 lbs of load in the car. Just proves that with the right driving style, the EPA numbers aren\\'t as bad as people say they are. With better conditions (for both of us) the numbers will only climb (I\\'ve seen 40 MPG twice in my 4-cyl, I\\'ll bet you might see 35 if you drove closer to 65 MPH).Hey, urnews (I hope you read this so I\\'m making your name big ), you mention your Fusion\\'s sticker, but you never mention what you actually paid for it. Since Accords are going consistently $1,000 and more under invoice, I\\'d guess your Fusion did too, making your deal better than the $27k you are telling us about. Fill us in! There\\'s not a bad car in this bunch! Some are just better for some people than others, and it is usually subjective (style, interior finishings, engine sounds, ride/handling compromise).  You got a nicely equipped car. I drive a 4-cyl Accord and I regret not buying V6. Grass is greener on the other side.  With my average mileage being close to 30 MPG, the grass is only greener looking for me because my engine pollutes less!  J/KI really have more power than I need in a 4-cylinder. It\\'s all relative. Embrace what you\\'ve got.  Are my eyes deceiving me? I see first place. Like I\\'ve said before, it\\'s the best you can get for $25,000.http://www.ifcar.net/reviews.comparisons.premiumfamilysedans.1stplace.htm  Are my eyes deceiving me? I see first place.Your link is different than the original link posted above. His referred to cars under 21k and the I4 Accord SE took third, behind an Optima and Sonata.  We all have different price ranges, this is true. $25,000 was my personal price limit.  Are my eyes deceiving me? I see first place. Like I\\'ve said before, it\\'s the best you can get for $25,000. I wouldn\\'t pay too much attention to rankings. I\\'m willing to bet you can find a fist place review for most midsize cars. They\\'re good for learning about a cars features, handling ect, but as far as ranking, it\\'s too subjective.I realy don\\'t think you can go wrong with most of the midsize sedans out there. the compettion has become so intense that the quality in all of them has gone up pretty significantly.

With the possible exception of the Verona. Don\\'t see much discussion about THAT car here.   Hey, urnews (I hope you read this so I\\'m making your name big ), you mention your Fusion\\'s sticker, but you never mention what you actually paid for it. Since Accords are going consistently $1,000 and more under invoice, I\\'d guess your Fusion did too, making your deal better than the $27k you are telling us about. Fill us in!GradWe didn\\'t get the best deal possible. They marked the $27,105 MSRP down to $24,180 and gave us $8,000 for a 2000 Mazda Miata convertible with 7,500 miles on it. (Not a misprint). We bought the car Dec. 4, 2006. All toll, we paid $16,180 for the $27,105 car.Had we been smart, we would have ordered an SEL 14, 5-speed manual and waited a few months until convertible season (higher trade-in) arrived.I would be much happier if the car just delivered average  miles per gallon, EPA-estimated 17 for in-city driving, which is 95 percent of our travel. I don\\'t believe that is every going to happen. We made some bad choices and are just stuck with the result. It was a cash deal. I figure the dealer made out like a bandit.We also should have considered the Accord more closely. We just automatically figured it would have cost more when equipped like the Fusion. The AWD was a big mistake. Our climate is moderate, with very little snow each year.The best way to describe our situation is \"buyer\\'s remorse.\" The next time, if there is one, I will do more homework and probably buy an Accord, an I4 at that.  Come on Boz - how can you expect average mpg when you only drive short stop-n-go trips with an average mph of 20?  Come on Boz - how can you expect average mpg when you only drive short stop-n-go trips with an average mph of 20?You\\'ve got a good memory Allen.  On the current tank we are only averaging 16 mph, even slower. But this is the year 2007. Shouldn\\'t a 160-cubic-inch V6 engine coupled to a six-speed automatic in a 3,200-pound car at least deliver 17 mpg in almost any city-driving conditions? It makes no sense to me that we can only manage 14.8 mpg when we are both gentle drivers. I just can\\'t fathom it. Something has to be wrong with this car.  Given that your avg. mph is only 16 on this tank, that implies that you either you drive in a lot of stop and go traffic with a goodly number of signals or stop signs, or you sit in traffic and your vehicle idles a great deal. Either way, it would seem that your driving is definitely not conducive to good mileage, even with a gentle foot on the gas pedal. What I would suggest you try, if possible, is to try and replicate the EPA test cycle and see what happens. Here is a link to the test variables:EPA Test cyclesWhen you get there, click on the tab \"Detailed Comparison\". The table listed will show you the the major test variables the EPA uses to determine mileage. If you can find a way to replicate the environment and test and then your vehicle still falls far short of the city mileage, then maybe there is a problem. Chances are though if you can replicate the test you will find that your car can meet the test results. Either way, maybe it will help reduce your \"buyer\\'s remorse\".   Shouldn\\'t a 160-cubic-inch V6 engine coupled to a six-speed automatic in a 3,200-pound car at least deliver 17 mpg in almost any city-driving conditions?Nope. Consider that for every minute you\\'re stopped in traffic or moving very slowly you\\'d have to spend an equal time at highway speed getting 34 mpg to average 17.You need a smaller engine that consumes less fuel when idling or better yet a hybrid that shuts off when stopped.Or get a longer, faster commute.  From the type of driving you face, it isn\\'t likely that you are getting into 6th gear (maybe not even 5th gear)on your typical commutes.  have a 213 CI, 268 hp engine in a 3600 lb. car that consistently gets me 27 mpg overall on EPA ratings of 22/31. Could I fathom a set of conditions where I might only average let\\'s say, 12 mpg - sure. It\\'s called stop and go traffic and gridlock. Take your AWD Fusion DT V6 out on the highway and drive away a tank at 65mph, if it doesn\\'t do closer to 30 mpg I would be surprised, and there may be something wrong with it. It is a relatively economical engine, although you have certainly penalized it with the AWD. EPA ratings really mean little except in relative terms, the fact that they are not realistic measures for many drivers and/or driving conditions is something that\\'s been going on for 30 years or so, I find it difficult to believe that you wouldn\\'t know this.That little 4 banger you yearn for probably won\\'t crack 18 under those same conditions your V6 is getting less than 15. Given that you apparently drive very few miles, suggest that the V6 is not really costing you much at the pumps - put a pencil to it - it may help with your \\'remorse\\' - but don\\'t think that the 2.3 4 cyl is going to come close to its city ratings either - at least for you.  Captain2,We have taken one 360-mile road trip with the 2007 SEL AWD when the car had 1,200 miles on it. It yielded 26 mpg going and 24 mpg returning. Average speed for the entire trip was 60 mph or so.Dealer road tested the car with an on-board computer hooked up at 1,500 miles and got 24 mpg at 50, 60 and 70 mph during a 12-mile run. Shop foreman pronounced it to be AOK, according to specs. He provided computer printouts of the testing. At the time, the car was only getting 13 mpg. Now, with 3,200 miles, it is getting 14.8 mpg.The original EPA estimate for this power train was 19 mpg city, 26 highway. That has since been revised to 17 mpg city and 24 highway. AWD is the culprit.I have no doubts that the car will deliver the EPA estimate for highway travel and am equally sure that it is never going to yield 17 mpg in our city driving. I might as well shut up about the situation and live with the fact that we bought a gas guzzler, by today\\'s standards.Our 2000 2.0-liter I4 Ford Focus station wagon only delivers 22 mpg in city driving over the same route pattern and our 1997 3.8-liter V6 Thunderbird averages 13 mpg over the same course.This being a 2007 model, I just naturally figured the Fusion would at least meet the EPA estimate. Obviously, that was flawed thinking on my part.Worse, these averages have been achieved without the AC on. I imagine there will be a 2 or 3 mpg penalty for that as summer arrives. An all-black interior won\\'t help any even though the car is white.I still like the styling of the Fusion better than any of the other mid-size sedans but am convinced we should have gone with the I4 and that AWD was a very bad mistake.What\\'s the expression, live and learn? Well, I have learned a lot since Dec. 4, 2006. If we ever do buy another vehicle it will probably be an Accord. Might as well go with the flow. All those millions of other buyers simply can\\'t be wrong.  The mpg should not be the same at 50, 60 and 70 mph. 24 mpg at 50 mph is especially low - something is wrong. My Accord 4-cyl stick shift is close to 50 mpg at a steady 50 mph. When using a Scangauge in average mode over several miles on level ground with no wind.You should be able to do much better than EPA highway at 50 mph.  most folks can match or better EPA highway at 60 mph, which is effectively what you did do on that trip you were talking about. 24 or 25 mpg highway is a long way from a \\'guzzler\\' IMO, although I think there are some larger sedans with V8s in them that may do what your Fusion does. I don\\'t believe that Ford or any other mfgr. has any ability to \\'cheat\\' the EPA tests any better or worse than they all already are. While it may be true that a Honda 6 (or 4 FTM) are more efficient engines, I can\\'t imagine the Accord doing much better (FE wise) in your particular case. The DT 3.0, while I certainly don\\'t like the engine much, is known for its reliability and relative FE - you may just be paying a big price for that \\'gimmicky\\' AWD.  I had a similar type drive to work...rarely did I drive more than 20 seconds without having to stop at a traffic light and my mph never went over 35. It took me 15 minutes to get to work and there were a few hills that I had to negotiate. My car at the time also had AWD and was a 2.5 liter Subaru, and I was usually around the 15 mpg mark when I was using the car to only go back and forth from work. I was driving my mazda 6 with a similar engine that you have along that route for a while and actually got better mileage (about 16 mpg), although my 6 is a manual transmission. I now take a different route to work that has less stops (although a little longer in distance, it takes less time if I hit the traffic lights right). Since there is a bit less stop and go, my mpg is up to 18. On longer drives with mostly highway, I get 27+ usually. Even when I took it to some really curvy roads with lots of hills and was almost always above 4k rpms in second or third gear, I got better than 20 mpg. So the distance and type of driving is killing your average... as others on this board have pointed out, there are not many cars you could get epa #\\'s with given your short distance with lots of stop and go.  While I don\\'t know that \"gimmicky\" is the right word for the AWD option I do believe that the mpg culprit. The car was equipped that way on the lot, it\\'s not something we consciously ordered. It snows very little, if ever, in Salisbury, Md. But I suppose all-wheel drive may be a factor any time the front wheels lose traction, such as wet or sandy conditions.The people who have the 3.0-liter V6 without AWD on the several forum where I participate generally seem to get good mileage. I seem to be the only exception, although a few owners with AWD have likewise reported poor mileage.I will say that the car handles exceedingly well but we did not test drive any other Fusion. That was a mistake. The dealer only had eight Fusions on the lot. This was the one we liked best. We should have ordered one rather than buying what was in stock.Several people have suggested the power train will not be broken in until the car gets to about 5,000 miles or so. We are at 3,200 now. I am pessimistic about that.    I could have told you about No. 24-21 on their list. The Avenger/Sebring isn\\'t even discussed about here it seems. I spent about 2.5 weeks in a rental Dodge Avenger SXT with the 2.7L V6... it wasn\\'t a total stripper either, had alloys, Sirius sat radio and so on.Worse seat I\\'ve tried yet - I couldn\\'t ever get comfortable in it. Way too much lumbar support built into the shape of the seat for my liking. Then you get all the chrome shiny bits that glare in your eyes when the sun\\'s up. Not to mention the corporate bluish greenish gauge lighting that\\'s just horrible looking IMO. Plenty of cheap plastics to go round.How it drives wasn\\'t much better either - basically transportation. Lumpy V6, not a lot of smoothness and honestly I prefered the Vulcan V6 in my old Taurus compared to this 2.7L V6. And then you have this look of the driver\\'s seat where you\\'re sunken in tons of sheetmetal... there isn\\'t a lot of greenhouse to work with.And yeah, Daimler just paid someone to buy Chrysler today. No wonder! :sick:  While I don\\'t know that \"gimmicky\" is the right word for the AWD option I do believe that the mpg culprit.I\\'d call it gimmicky cause it isn\\'t a true AWD system like in Subaru/Audi. Basically you have a FWD that can transfer some power to rear wheels when wheel slip is detected.Let us know if you ever get fed-up of your Fusion, what you get for it in a trade-in. A lot of people here can\\'t seem to agree if the Fusion will be worth anything in a trade-in or not. Some think so, others think not.  Neteng101,According to one Yahoo cars Web site the one-year depreciation on a similar Fusion was about $4,600, if I remember correctly, but only about 1,200 for the second year.One of two things is going to happen: I\\'m either going to trade it for a 2009 \"something\" or drive it for as long as it will run. I don\\'t except to posting on here at the time. But who knows? Everyone is so friendly.I just like reading about cars and daydreaming about them. The J.D. Powers\\' \"Most Appealing Mid-Size Sedan\" award for the Fusion was a big factor in our buying decision, reinforced by its Consumer Reports marks.Even the \"experts\" and \"pros\" are wrong some of the time. I didn\\'t do enough homework and got burned for it. According to my math it\\'s \"only\" going to cost me an EXTRA $524 a year in gasoline costs for the crummy 14.8 mpg. I guess having a 2007 SEL AWD might be worth an extra $10 a week.How about Chrysler being sold? That\\'s the big automotive news of the day. I wonder how that will pan out. :confuse:  If you look at the top picks summary page, you would see Hyundai Sonata / Kia Optima seat as best-in-class family sedans overall.http://www.ifcar.net/toppicks.htm  My sister has an 06 Optima, and the seats are not comfortable at all. She says she can not stand more than 1/2 hour in the driver seat.  While I don\\'t know that \"gimmicky\" is the right word for the AWD option I do believe that the mpg culprit.I am guessing that the AWD system in my MazdaSpeed6 is similar or identical to the Fusion AWD. With almost 10K miles, the worst gas mileage my Speed6 has registered (on a full tank) is 24 mpg; last tank was 27.5 mpg. I realize that AWD does diminish gas mileage, but not drastically. You need to look at the other factors in your situation; your commute traffic route is likely the biggest factor. Here in the mountains of Colorado I have been very pleased with the AWD this past winter. The only way I can get a wheel to spin is to break the whole car loose by flooring the gas pedal while driving in very icy conditions. It performs very similar to my wife\\'s Audi Quattro.  \"Out of curiousity, do you realize that it IS ok for people to disagree with you and it not be personal? There always seems to be a chip on your shoulder. Sure, the Fusion will hold up 100,000 miles, as should any car on the market today. Anyone saying otherwise is just trying to push your buttons. \"I never said it wasn\\'t ok for people to disagree. you also may want to look over to your shoulder sometime too.. :shades:  urnews, Accords DO cost more than like equipped Fusions. Thousands more, not just the $1500 some lead you to believe. Why don\\'t you try to trade the Fusion in for a Fusion SEL I4 and see what happens?I am very curious as to why you feel buyers remorse? I understand your MPG issues. What other reasons for remorse? :confuse:  Just seems like you take things a little too seriously sometimes. No sense getting worked up over people saying things that aren\\'t true. I\\'m through responding to your repeated and untrue claims about Accords costing $5k more than a comparable Ford, especially since you have stated you\\'d never own one and don\\'t like them. You shouldn\\'t respond to people saying that say \"Ford\\'s are garbage, and you\\'ll be lucky to see 80k miles\" etc... because they\\'d probably never shop for a Ford, and are just posting biased comments against them without credence.We both know that the statements are untrue, so let\\'s just be satisfied, and try to only talk about things we know about, and not get so wrapped up in defending our choices, because as we should all know, Bob\\'s choice may not be right for Chuck, and Chuck\\'s may not be right for Bob. They picked different cars, but they each got the best possible value.EDIT: Scape, i just realized in your little profile that your name is Bob!

He doesn\\'t need/want the V6 engine, and feel he would\\'ve been much happier with a much less-expensive Fusion than the $24k and change he paid (he got a completely loaded model, with AWD and HP which he doesn\\'t need).It\\'s probably how I\\'d feel if I\\'d bought an Accord EX-L V6 with Navi. I don\\'t need the Navi system (I have a portable one) and I certainly would rather have the economy of the 4-cyl over the excess power of the V6.  Accords DO cost more than like equipped Fusions.And they are worth every penny. 4 out of 5 reviewers recommend the Accord to their readers who buy midsize sedans. What happened to the 5th guy? He had an accident. :sick:  Accords DO cost more than like equipped Fusions. And they are worth every penny.To YOU. Not to everyone.  on my trip to Boise was 32.2MPG in my v6 SEL Fusion. My average speed was 75mph. This is way better than Ford claims. I am very, very happy with my Fusion. Urnews, give it time. Give the car time to break in. I have just over 14,500 and my mileage is on the trend upward. When I first bought the car I was even skeptical. I was averaging 17MPG!! for about the first 3-4,000 miles. Then my mileage jumped dramatically per the computer in the car. Get out on the net and find other forums with Fusion/Milan owners. Get out on the net! If you want Fusion sites e-mail me at [email\\xa0protected] and I will send them to you. I can\\'t link you to them here at Edmunds they frown on this. The Fusion is a great car and a great value.   \\'gimmicky\\' only in that few drivers will ever find an effective use for it and the manner in which it is employed in what really are FWD cars. The vast majority (I would guess 90%) of the population of this country, do not regularly see road conditions (snow/ice covered roads) bad enough or frequently enough that the extra cost/weight penalties can truly be justified and/or proper driving techniques in a std. FWD (or even RWD) wouldn\\'t do just fine. That said, there is a good reason, why Subarus sell so well in your part of the country. In the mountains of Colorado, you as part of that 10%, would certainly understand the benefits of AWD or, even better, 4WD - but for the majority of us I\\'ll stick to the contention that is a waste of money and gas - and a gimmick of sorts. Further, normally these systems route well over 90% of the power to the front wheels anyway, only pushing power rearward (up to maybe 50%)in the event of loss of traction at the front, again an infrequent occurrence - unless, of course, you live in Colorado. While there is no doubt that AWD systems and/or stability control systems have become the rage, I question not only the need for such systems but also the rather invasive way these systems (SC) can be implemented. While there is no doubt that a computer may \\'save our bacon\\', I look very suspiciously at a \\'computer\\' making those kinds of decisions for me.  With today\\'s technology, etc..I wonder if perhaps some of the manufacturers set their computers to show increased MPG results with increased miles. I know the engines \"free-up\" or break-in or whatever, but I am wondering about more than that. Could they be setting the computers to show better MPG as we go down the road?? Just a thought... :confuse: van   Well, I also \"do the math\" with my trusty little calculator in addition to reading the computer readout display. We (my Texas Instruments calculator and my auto computer) generally always agree +/- a tiny bit. Do you also line your windows with aluminum foil to block the government mind control transmissions??? Just a joke.....   If mpg is important to you, maybe you should go to a Honda dealer and see what kind of trade they\\'ll give you on the Fusion. You might be able to get into an Accord I-4 SE 5 speed manual for not much money at all...The I-4 i-Vtec manual Accords are said to get close to their epa ratings of 26 in the city and 34 on the highway. My less advanced 02 Accord I 4 manual, with the regular VTEC engine (before i-VTEC), gets about 23-25 around town, and about 30-33 on the highway (70-75 mph, ac running, fully loaded with four passengers and luggage). Or, perhaps wait for the all new 08 Accord which is rumored to have the new Advanced VTEC engine. The A-VTECs are supposed to have more power, and 10% higher mpg. So that might mean as high as 28 mpg around town and as high as 36 on the highway. Of course, those all new A-VTEC Accords, which look a bit like a 5 series BMW, are probably going to be selling at close to list price for a while....I\\'m going to try and wait until the summer of 08 when they might be had at a bit of a discount.  Not yet, but am thinking about it. I heard it works.!  hmmm I too use the old fashioned way of calculating the mpg, then compare/record both. I keep a running total..just a habit from years ago. Yes the mileage increases with the miles but sometimes seems to make unusual jumps. van  \"The vast majority (I would guess 90%) of the population of this country, do not regularly see road conditions (snow/ice covered roads) bad enough or frequently enough that the extra cost/weight penalties can truly be justified and/or proper driving techniques in a std.\"I couldn\\'t disagree more. After years of owning FWD and RWD cars, all my cars now have AWD. I\\'ll take the penality in gas over the more surefootedness in wintery conditions. In addition, when one steps on the gas a true full-time AWD has four tires launching the car instead of two. Making for smoother takeoffs in bad conditions.\"I look very suspiciously at a \\'computer\\' making those kinds of decisions for me.\" That maybe, but you are clearly in the realm of: \"you don\\'t know what you don\\'t know\" about stability systems.  Most Fusions also get at or above their EPA city ratings if you drive normally. Boz (urnews) does not drive normally and won\\'t get normal EPA city mileage no matter what he drives except possibly a Hybrid.  \"The vast majority (I would guess 90%) of the population of this country, do not regularly see road conditions (snow/ice covered roads) bad enough or frequently enough that the extra cost/weight penalties can truly be justified and/or proper driving techniques in a std.\"I couldn\\'t disagree more.

In addition, when one steps on the gas a true full-time AWD has four tires launching the car instead of two. Making for smoother takeoffs in bad conditions.I gotta say I concur. The AWD 4 cylinder manual transmission wagon gets roughly the same MPG as the older manual transmission FWD car. Both seem to get low-mid 30s on the highway, upper mid-20s in town. The wagon has been fantastic in terms of meeting needs, 5spd, good mileage, feels like a tank in bad weather, tows a small-ish (2500lbs) trailer with no problems, baby seats fit well, and was about 1k more than the Accord at the time, for AWD and a wagon body style.\"I look very suspiciously at a \\'computer\\' making those kinds of decisions for me.\" There is no computer in the AWD system. There are true limited slip differentials (I believe they are Torsen type). None of this computer controlled engine retarding traction control nonsense.  AKirby,Allen, we do drive \"normal,\" as in gentle, conservative. But perhaps our average usage -- short commute, stop-and-go, short hops -- is not normal. There is a difference between the two entities, in my humble opinion.Maybe nothing, except a hybrid, would make a difference. All I know is that 13 mpg for the first 2,000 miles or so was financially painful and 14.8 mpg now is not much better.I would not recommend the AWD option to anyone, unless they live in upstate New York or one of the snowy climes. AWD is a waste of money at the outset and a mileage killer in the long term, which is more money down the fill-up tube.Our decision to buy a car equipped this way was just plain stupid. It was a \"fuelish\" move on our part. That\\'s what happens when you see a car you \"just have to have.\" FoMoCo does not equip many of its SELs with an I4 and a manual tranny but you can order one that way, which is what we should have done.An I4 manual might not reach its EPA estimates given our driving pattern, but at least it would have been cheaper to operate overall. Hindsight is always 20-20, unfortunately.According to my calculations it will cost us $524 a year EXTRA to operate at 14.8 mpg versus the revised EPA estimate of 17 mpg. But that was figured out when gasoline was \"only\" $2.22. It\\'s now at $2.74 a gallon and rising almost daily. That only increases the pain.I pity the people, ourself included, who are stuck with vehicles that deliver low gasoline mileage.If there is a next time, I will opt for an Accord.  Boz - of course I was referring to extreme stop-n-go short commutes and not your personal driving style.A hybrid would really be your best bet. This is the type of driving where they excel. You could probably get 45-50 mpg from a Prius or less than that with a hybrid Camry (or the 09 Fusion hybrid). The V6 Accord hybrid won\\'t come close.Just trying to level set your expectations so you\\'re not disappointed a second time.  you are clearly in the realm of: \"you don\\'t know what you don\\'t know\" about stability systems. well this just might be the other way around - go ahead and revel in your political correctness, but you should at least understand that a computer IS making driving decisions (and adjustments) for you, along the lines of applying brakes for you, cutting throttle and/or slowing steering responses. And the problem has nothing to do with the principles of the systems like this to begin with but with how invasive they can become courtesy of that computer programmer and HIS (or some lawyer\\'s) judgement of what a vehicle\\'s dynamic situation must be before HE THINKS we are unable to cope with it. Educate yourself, read a few road tests, and see how SC systems can and do inhibit many vehicles ultimate handling capabilites in terms of really quantifiable numbers.  Yeah, I sorta figured you were referring to the driving pattern and not the drivers. I was just having some fun, as I suspect you were, unintentionally.Yup, I\\'ve made up my mind. Our next vehicle will be a hybrid and or a Accord, maybe a Prius (they are so ugly they are beautiful (and everybody knows you are doing your part for the environment).It was the bold distinctive styling, the exceptional handling, the many nice creature comforts that sold on us on the Fusion (and its many favorable reviews in the media).The next time around it will be all about economy, economy, economy. I once owed a 1958 VW Beetle that didn\\'t even have a gas gauge. Didn\\'t need one, it delivered 30 mpg all the time and had a 10-gallon gas tank. You were good for 300 miles no matter how you drove it. It was a fun car. Unfortunately I totaled it, but walked away.Is the Prius considered a compact? I think mid-size is our comfort level. Which car is the mileage champ in this group?  Prius is a mid-sizer based on EPA volume numbers. For four adults it is plenty roomy; actual legroom in the back is better than some other mid-sizers like the Mazda6 and Legacy. There\\'s also the Camry and Altima hybrids, and soon Aura and Malibu will be available as \"mild\" hybrids. Of all the \"mid-sized\" cars, I think the Prius is (per EPA anyway) the FE champ.  Why don\\'t you try to trade the Fusion in for a Fusion SEL I4 and see what happens?I am very curious as to why you feel buyers remorse? I understand your MPG issues. What other reasons for remorse?Scape2,We are not going to do anything, as far as trades go, for at least one model year. Maybe, as you say, the mileage will improve as the Fusion matures. If it would just get 17 mpg, the revised EPA estimate, I would be satisfied, really.Our (my) buyer\\'s remorse is solely related to the mpg situation because that is a dollars and cents issue. The Fusion is fine otherwise, a genuinely outstanding car, the best we have every owned. (The large turning radius takes some getting used to and backing up is tricky because of limited visibility. These are factors that you learn to make adjustments for.)My wife could care less about mileage. Maybe I should adopt that outlook, too. But I just can\\'t. It bugs me big time. If there is a next time I will definitely opt for a four-cylinder, manual transmission something.I (we) believe the Fusion to be an exceptional automobile, EXCEPT for the mpg issue. That is my only real complaint.  I would not recommend the AWD option to anyone, unless they live in upstate New York or one of the snowy climes. AWD is a waste of money at the outset and a mileage killer in the long term, which is more money down the fill-up tube.I don\\'t know, SE MI has enough days of grumpy weather to justify AWD for our needs (especially since it doesn\\'t seem to have a mileage penalty yet). If I was still on the west coast, I would be less excited about it. Gas here is $3.28, but realistically, its not that often the cars need to be filled up so I can\\'t complain as much as some.  Don\\'t believe all the hype about Honda 6\\'s being more fuel efficient. Our \\'06 Honda Odyssey doesn\\'t come close to manufacture estimates of 20 city/ 28 highway. More like 17 city and 21 highway. If you read the experiences of other foreign vehicle owners you will see that they are just as frustrated with not achieving stated or claimed fuel efficiencies as anyone else. Bottom line is you cannot overcome the law of physics. Heavy vehicle with powerful engine= not very good gas mileage. If you want an efficient vehicle get a diesel if you need power and a 4 cylinder if you don\\'t care. Or else just buy a 2 year old vehicle with low mileage and use your savings to pay for gas.  Suprising about the Odyssey. Our Sienna gets EPA or better on the highway. 26 or 27 mpg on long Interstate trips at 75 mph. Up to 30 mpg at slower speeds.  I\\'ve read that most of the emissions that come from a car happen in the first 5 minutes of operation when the car is not up to temperature... so I wonder if this has something to do with cars having poor mpg when driven short distances. But I\\'d have to agree with others that have suggested a hybrid probably makes the most sense for the type of driving you have described. The Camry seems to be the standout hybrid in the midsize department at this point. But if you trade your car in on another for the next few years, I would imagine you would be upside-down as far as trade in value is concerned. the money you would lose by trading in too quickly would easily pay for your gas for a few years. To be blunt, there really aren\\'t a whole lot of good options for you right now. If your drive to work is longer than your wife\\'s, perhaps it might make economic sense to trade cars with you driving the fusion? Anyways, hope you can get over your angst... by all reports, it sounds like it\\'s a very nice car but maybe not ideal for your circumstances, but it still is a nice car.  My aunt\\'s 2005 Odyssey gets what the EPA advertises on the highway. At 80 MPH on my first trip to Oklahoma, we got 23.3 MPG. You might say \"that\\'s lower than EPA (EPA is 19/25), but we were going 80 MPH, with A/C running, and many belongings.Your mileage may certainly vary.  Yes, Zzzoom6, it is a very nice car in all other respects. The poor mileage is its only flaw at this point. We don\\'t even have any squeaks, rattles, shakes, etc. The fit and finish on the Fusion is 100 percent.We\\'ll most likely keep the car until the 2009s debut, at least. Who knows maybe the mileage will magically improve at 5,000 or 10,000 miles, even though I doubt it.I\\'m retired, but my wife (12 years younger) still works. There is only one commute involved, hers, and sometimes she takes our 2000 Ford Focus station wagon to work. It delivers 22 mpg over the same driving pattern. That is below the EPA estimate, too.As you suggest, a hybrid would be an ideal vehicle for our circumstances. I will definitely explore that possibility the next time around. Who knows, maybe there will be a decent Fusion hybrid by that time.Oddly enough this is the only four-door my wife would really consider. (She had her heart set on a Mustang, but that was just not practical enough at this time.) We actually owned two Mustangs in the past. Neither were particularly good cars and we did not keep them for very long, but they sure are sporty.One of the former Mustangs had a pathetic four banger in it and it was severely underpowered. That\\'s why we went for a V6 in the Fusion. According to what I\\'ve read on three Fusion forums, the I4, 160-horsepower engine is more than adequate.Indeed, most of the fours available in the mid-size cars today seem to be quite adequate, according to what I have read.The bottom line is we should have ordered an I4 manual SEL rather than buy the $27,105 MSRP car that was on the lot. We were smitten with the car. You know how that goes.I was also interested in the Sonata but the wife considers all of the Asian makes to be \"plain Jane lookalikes.\" The Fusions styling, handling and good press reviews turned out to be the deciding factors.Heck, I even think the Prius is so homely as to be attractive in a perverse way. Wife can\\'t stand them. As I mentioned in an earlier post, she doesn\\'t even care about mileage. (I\\'m in charge of filling up the cars and paying for it, so why should she?)  Heck, I even think the Prius is so homely as to be attractive in a perverse waylol, know what you mean. the scoion\\'s are kind of the same way.  \"Educate yourself, read a few road tests, and see how SC systems can and do inhibit many vehicles ultimate handling capabilites in terms of really quantifiable numbers.\"I\\'ve been educated. One of my former cars had stability control and I have a raft of experience with it. Stability control is supposed to keep the car under control, however, the stability control on my car could be disengaged. This will prevent the car from (thankfully) reaching it\\'s full potential at the expense of having it go out from under you.Again, unless you have extensively driven a car with a stability control system and have tried to defeat it, you are only speaking from what you have read, not what you have driven.If it saves your bacon once, it has done it\\'s job.  you finally posted the truth. you are not the primary driver, so you don\\'t really know how your fusion is being driven. it is ok. it is a small price to pay.   Me too! I\\'ll probably get a Fusion Hybrid when it becomes available in 2009. I drive 22miles one way to work. So far my average has creeped up to 24MPG. I\\'m really hoping it keeps going up to about 25 would be nice. :shades:  I have to take disagree with you on this issue. I have a \\'03 accord with a 6 cylinder and I have averaged 25-26mpg on mixed driving. The manufacture estimate is 21 city/ 30 highway and although I have owned the car for over a year I have never had an extended highway trip to check the mpg. I have gotten 29mpg on half a tank of highway miles and the rest my normal commute. That is better then the \\'02 Maxima I had which I averaged 22-23mpg (Granted the Maxima was a 3.5l and the Accord is a 3.0l). The best I ever averaged on only highway mileage 27mpg in the Maxima.  My brother has a \\'04 Mazada6 with a 6 cylinder and 5m he is averaging 25mpg on 80% highway mileage. With a 100 mile daily commute he wishes he was getting my mpg. He also wishes he knew Mazda was going to release the Speed6 before he bought his 6 cylinder.  We also have an \\'05 AWD Pilot which my wife drives and she averages 18mpg on more stop and go traffic. On vacation I have averaged 22-23mpg going 75-85mph on strictly highway driving. We have been satisfied with mileage considering the size, weight and AWD. IMO Honda does build a good compromise between power and mpg in their 6 cylinders.  again referencing multiple testing by multiple publications, almost all tests of things like lane change and/or skidpad pad abilities lately have been showing up with an asterisk next to those numbers - the asterisk - stability control inhibited. Even CR (who would figure to champion such systems) now grudgingly admits that SC can and does limit ultimate evasive capabilities. My point being that there is a really really low probability that SC system intervention might also \\'cost you your bacon\\', in lets say a high speed avoidance manuever - depending on how the intervention levels are set by that computer programmer in the first place. That said, things like this are certainly more likely to work for you than against you but the buyer needs to understand that it is not a free ride from a performance standpoint and especially that while it might make his car safer, it is not improving handling (stability yes, handling no). What I\\'ve read only confirms a coupla of experiences I had. Following a successful \\'heart in my throat\\' accelerating high speed avoidance manuever (swerve) in my own non-VSC car, I did take an opportunity to test VSC personally as installed in a Sonata (don\\'t ever buy a rental car that I have had a chance to play with  , my cornering exit speed (on a favorite traffic circle of mine) was 10 mph less (VSC on vs. off) because the car \\'went dead\\' as I approached those computer imposed limits for that particular car. There is no way that the Sonata system would have \\'allowed\\' me to do, what I did do several weeks earlier in my own car although I can\\'t definitely say if I would have been involved in that particular pileup or not. Incidentally, many of those VSC off switches do not completely disable the system and I know of no cars that wouldn\\'t automatically re-engage the system when restarted - making the \\'off\\' switch largely impractical anyway.  \"My point being that there is a really really low probability that SC system intervention might also \\'cost you your bacon\\',\"Your whole point is moot as stability systems will be required on cars in the future. You have to drive a BMW to see how stability control should be integrated into the driving experience, not a Hyundai. I would take the risk that stability system would cost me \"my bacon\", on the bet I have a better chance of it saving \"my bacon\". That\\'s like saying there is a good change an airbag deployment will physically hurt me, therefore I will disable it. But the airbag can also save your life.In the meantime avoidance at high speed is best done with a stability system enabled, not disabled. We obviously disagree (and I have multiple years of living with a car with a s/c as a daily driver not just a few test drives), but the point will be moot in a few years.  How, exactly does BMW integrate their version of SC to \"enhance\" the driving experience?? and why doesn\\'t Hyundai\\'s version seem satisfactory? In as much as BMW is thought of as a drivers car are the limits before stability control \"takes over\" somehow higher than those of the Hyundai? If so, does the average or less than average driver not reap the benefits simply because the limits are too high? Or does the system as a whole work more smoothly?? Please explain.  It could easily be solved by doing what Honda (among a few others) does. Make it defeatable by simply pushing a button!  you miss the point, grad. Even if you can shut off the system, it will still be normally on when you restart the car - so therefore the system is always on, perhaps as it should be. The Sonata also has a simple VSC on/off button and it does make a difference!  Perhaps as it should be you say... I think you are probably right on that.Out of 350,000 Accord buyers (let\\'s say that\\'s the number for example\\'s sake), how many are going to be so aggressive in their driving that they need the stability system set where it won\\'t intervene when they crank the car? That\\'s where I think Honda has it right (for me anyway). When i get frisky behind the wheel of my Accord (it\\'s a 4-cyl so there is no VSA at all), chances are, the next day/trip I take I\\'m not gonna be so aggressive the next time. I\\'ll probably be making my commute to work/school, or going to Wal-mart, where I\\'d want VSA on.  I found this to be the case in a 545 BMW I drove, the car is a computerized \\'nightmare\\' and seemingly ties SC intervention points into the \\'ride\\' settings you set after going thru what seemed to be 23 submenus on the silly \\'i drive\\' computer. A \\'sport\\' setting would tighten the suspension and also raise the intervention level on the SC. A good \\'sports sedan\\' will do things that nobody short of Mario Andretti would dream of trying and still not incur the wrath of SC. The Hyundai, (or any of the other cars in this group) OTH is by no means a sports sedan, despite Hyundai\\'s rather ludricrous ads trying to compare it to one, or Mazda\\'s earnest efforts at trying to be one. So therefore, as the car\\'s capabilities are less, so too must the intervention levels be adjusted, keeping in mind of course that anybody that spends that kind of money on that BMW is rightfully expecting performance beyond what is generally available, while that Sonata is being sold as a \\'family sedan\\' for the masses. Don\\'t know that I could ever bite on a computer controlled SC system \\'enhancing\\' (kdshapiro\\'s word) anything, only that those particular cars are so dynamically superior that they don\\'t need to get in the way in the hands of anybody with even an ounce of sanity.  What, exactly, does stability control do and how does it do it? Other than BMW, what mid-sized sedans have it now, either as standard equipment or as an option? Didn\\'t I read somewhere that is will become a mandated feature within a few years? I\\'m in the dark on this topic. Help.  SC can\\'t always save your bacon either. If the traction is not there you will still go off the road.I played around with it this winter on our sienna, and in snow and ice it was very easy to get the back out at quite extreme angles. If you car has the ability to brake just one wheel to bring you back on course it won\\'t do any good if that one wheel has little or no traction available.We bought the option as a safety feature, but pushing the car to the point where it might intervene is asking for trouble because it might not be able to save you. It is really for emergencies.Having said that I am quite comfortable in my non SC Accord 4-cyl. It is not quite as nimble as my Integra, and has lower cornering limits, but it is very easy to drive fast. It has a nice progressive power on understeer and power off oversteer. Meaning if you go into a turn too fast (within reason) under power and notice you are going wide, then just take your foot of the gas and the front end pivots around. This is quite intuitive as taking your foot of the gas is your first instinct when things look to be going awry.My Integra has similar traits, and I always had a lot of fun hanging the tail out in the snow (I always run 4 snow tires, so there was some traction).  A short list of vehicles with stability control available - Hyundai SonataToyota CamryHonda Accord V6Nissan AltimaThese are the ones I\\'m sure have it. The only one I\\'m sure that doesn\\'t offer it in some way is Ford with its Fusion. I think Chevy/Pontiac may offer Stabilitrak on the Malibu and G6, but i could be quite wrong, and wouldn\\'t bet a dime on it. Subaru Legacy may also have it too? Somebody with more knowledge can step in and fill in my many blanks! Vehicle websites will give you a full list of the available features, including safety features (like stability control) if you wanted to know about a particular vehicle.  When VSC is required I\\'m curious to see if Ford and GM put their versions of RSC in cars too. All of Ford\\'s SUVs have it standard right now and it belongs in them but I don\\'t know if cars need it per say. Of course, I don\\'t believe most cars even need VSC either. It may also be cheaper to just throw it in as is rather than re-engineer just to take the RSC out. I\\'m pretty sure Volvo, who developed the Ford system, does put RSC in their cars so that could be a good sign.  I know Mazda has it on the 3. I almost bought a 3 because of that. For some reason the 6 does not have it.  It is not worthwhile to compare mpg from different drivers driving under different condions. MPG will vary a lot depending on how and where a car is driven. For most midsize cars CR will routinely gets 14-16 mpg in their city test. Meanwhile EPA has gotten 20-24, for the same cars in their test. These large differences are just due to the way the car is driven in each test.The guy with Fusion remorse, likely drives more like the CR city test rather than the EPA test. CR reported 14 mpg for \"city\" in a V6 Fusion. The I-4 got 15 mpg in that test, while the last test of an Accord I4 got 16 mpg.  The good indicator is that urnews got 22 MPG on the route his Fusion goes on now. Both are below EPA estimates, so it really isn\\'t that the car is performing abnormally bad. It is just doing what any other car would get driven as such... below EPA numbers.  Others in this class that have ESC include:GalantLegacyMazda6OptimaPriusNotably, of those listed above or in your post, I think the only mid-sizer that offers ESC standard on all trims is the Sonata.  Noteworthy indeed. And thanks for filling in my holes. I just got the call, my car is ready (check out the 1994-1997 Accord Maintenance and Repair forum for my sad news). Long story short, radiator cracked after 172,000 miles of Alabama weather. Not a cheap fix!  What you cite is not the case on the 550, 650, 750, 335. I just got done driving \\'em all (2007 models), all the while being able to easily use i-drive at 50 mph. The DSC was either on, partially on or off. Simply controlled by a button on the console. Having been used to a stability system for a few years, I trusted the way it works in these vehicles. (I do agree the 750 is a techno dream come true).So let\\'s say I couldn\\'t disagree more with your post about the way BMW DSC works. The purpose of a stability system is to control the car in ways you can\\'t. You do not have to be Mario Andretti to appreciate a good DSC saving your bacon, while not being intrusive.  \"We bought the option as a safety feature, but pushing the car to the point where it might intervene is asking for trouble because it might not be able to save you. It is really for emergencies.\"You are correct, it\\'s sort of like believing air-bags will save your life in a collision no matter what. All of these safety features combine in an attempt to keep you out of the morgue if possible.  i think urnews can expect the gas mileage to rise 3-5% per year for at least the next couple of years. i am not sure when it will peak. there are a lot of parts that need to break in with an awd vehicle.  The good indicator is that urnews got 22 MPG on the route his Fusion goes on now. Whoa, TheGraduate, not I. But I wish it were so. Our SEL AWD 2007 Fusion get 14.8 mpg in city driving. On the one road trip we took, 360 miles round trip, we got 26 mpg going and 24 mpg returning.For the first 2,000 miles on the car we got an insane 13 mpg. The 14.8 figure is an improvement achieved over the last 1,000 miles. The car now has 3,000 miles on it.I\\'d have a pleasurable heart attack if the Fusion ever delivered 22 mpg in city driving. You have me confused with someone else. The revised EPA estimates for this power train are 17 mpg city, 24 highway.The people who are squawking the loudest about the Fusion\\'s poor mileage are the AWD owners. Regular V6 and I4 owners are reporting descent mileage.My wife (who doesn\\'t really care about mileage) and I really like everything else about the car, are totally satisfied.Our 2000 Ford Focus station wagon, I4 2.0 liter, 4-speed automatic, delivers 22 mpg over the same commute route. That\\'s a little low too, but not so noticeable.  Interesting that none of you who are spouting off about stability control could explain how it works.In a car it senses whether the car is understeering (you\\'re turning left but the car keeps going straight) or oversteering (the rear end starts to slide around) and corrects it by cutting the throttle or torque and/or applying brakes to one or more wheels. In the case of understeer (on a left turn) it will apply brakes to the left rear wheel which will pull the front back to the left in line with the steering input.This is monitored with a yaw sensor and requires 4 channel ABS so that one wheel can be independently braked. Since the Fusion (and I assume the Mazda6) only have 3 channel ABS they can\\'t do it. The next generation will have it. I believe Ford has committed to have it on all vehicles by 2010.Lincoln had stability control on the Lincoln LS way back in 1999. It was obviously not judged to be important enough to mandate the 4 channel ABS in the CD3 cars.  your focus has an epa city rating of 25 or 26 mpg. the math seems similar.  Remember the Focus also had it for a few years as a very inexpensive option too. No one opted for it and dealers rarely ordered it for their stock so Ford discontinued it. I think it went away for MY2005 IIRC.  a non-scientific poll. But over the last few days I have noticed a few new Kia Optima\\'s on the road. I also noticedd the ones I am seeing are v6 models that look loaded. Looks like the secrets out. Just out of curiosity I\\'m going to go test drive one this weekend and see how they feel/look.  No, I was talking about your Focus that got 22 MPG (which is below its EPA estimate too). Not the Fusion getting 22MPG. My point was both of your cars got modestly below EPA numbers. You are getting 15 MPG in your Fusion, which is supposed to get 17. Your Focus got 22 MPG, which is 2 MPG below its rating of 24 MPG (City). Looks pretty darn similar to me. Your driving route is the problem, not your car.  Some of you don\\'t seem aware of the EPA\\'s new \\' 08 CAFE standards and estimates. They are significantly lower. Most folks we know with new vehicles from HD trucks and SUVs to family sedans do not get the EPA sticker estimates in real world.I find the Consumer Reports numbers to be closer to mine but our Highlander Hybrid can be driven in such a way that we can get 26 -28 mpg. Car & Driver published a long term test of the Lexus 400h and the editor in AZ averaged 27mpg for several months while he had it. BTW, our Hh and the 400h have blazing acceleration - 0 to 60 in 6.8 seconds with fully charged traction batteries. The other SUVs that are this quick suck gas like crazy.On ESC - NIHSTA is mandating it for all passenger vehicles sold in the US by 2010 or 2012. They, CR, and several insurance companies are convinced ESC will save more lives than any other safety feature.  At least some Mazda6\\'s can be had with stability control.If Ford has stability control on all its vehicles by 2010, it will be one year ahead of the Federal mandate for stability control on all new passenger vehicles by September 2011.  What you cite is not the case on the 550, 650, 750, 335.From what I understand - BMW did make some modifications to the \\'i-drive\\' in an attempt to make it more user friendly - something it certainly wasn\\'t in its first renditions. As far as SC setting go in the the 545. I could not get it to activate regardless of what the driving setting was, probably due to my own lack of nerve, skill, respect for traffic laws or possibly the fact that it is a friend\\'s car. This is not the case in some of these more mundane cars I\\'ve driven so equipped but is the way it should be - SC settings should be at some level very close to what the car is capable of NOT what some computer programmer or lawyer thinks the driver is capable of.  That\\'s why they advertised the 2010 date - they\\'ll be voluntarily meeting the Federal guidelines a year or two early.  Only the Mazdaspeed6 has stability control, it is not available in any other Mazda6.  If Ford has stability control on all its vehicles by 2010, it will be one year ahead of the Federal mandate for stability control on all new passenger vehicles by September 2011a sad commentary of the state of things of at Ford, given that all the mfgrs. knew several years in advance of the upcoming \\'mandate\\'. There is a reason, that the Sonata, for example, has standard SC since its introduction 2 years ago - Hyundai knew it was coming, further understood that things like this SELL, and had the money and the ability to integrate all the components into a working system (yaw sensors, multi channel brake systems, DBW throttle and tranny control and, of course, that silly computer program that tells everything what to do). And this whole PC push, is largely a knee-jerk reaction to some poorly designed FORD SUVs on some crappy tires. Ford should not be lauded for being about the last to comply, they should have been in the forefront.  That is the way to use the EPA mileage estimates...if you get less than the rated figure now, expect to get about the same amount less with your new car. Apparently some think that if the EPA sticker says 19 for their new car that this means they will get that, even though their old car has an EPA rating of 26 and they get 22 with it :confuse: . I have seen this sort of comment before, where someone is complaining about the mileage in their new car. Then you ask what they drove before and what their mpg was and it turns out it was getting just as much below the EPA numbers as the new car.When I turned over my old Windstar to my kid to drive the mpg dropped from the 19 I had typically been getting to 15 or less for him. This is because he drives 3 miles to school and 2 miles to work, while I drive 9.5 miles to work.I noticed that it seems that the CR city test is actually much harder on 4 cylinders than V6s. For example the Fusion I4 gets 23 city from EPA, but only 15 from CR. The V6 Fusion gets EPA 20 and CR 14. So the I4 drops by 9 mpg and 39%, while the V6 drops by \"only\" 5 mpg and 25%.  Ford should not be lauded for being about the last to comply, they should have been in the forefront. The Explorer has had AdvanceTrak with RSC standard for 3 years now. RSC was at the forefront because no one else had that extra measure of protection. I think GM is the only other to have something similar now.IIRC all of their SUVs and CUVs have it now. They just don\\'t have it in their cars and that\\'s not just them.  \"This is not the case in some of these more mundane cars I\\'ve driven so equipped but is the way it should be - SC settings should be at some level very close to what the car is capable of NOT what some computer programmer or lawyer thinks the driver is capable of.\"Didn\\'t you just hit the nail on the head? You bashed stability control technology for it\\'s lousy implementation on a Hyundai. Maybe it\\'s a great reason not to buy the Hyundai if it drives as you said due to lousy stability control. But other cars have it right, in any case it\\'s coming your way like it or not. Lawyers and computer programmers will have a say how you drive your car.As far as idrive, it is set it and forget it. BMW and some other manufacturers have done stability control right for years.  Lawyers and computer programmers will have a say how you drive your car. and this is really where my problem is - those lawyers and computer programmers have no idea who I am and from a driving perspective what I\\'m capable or not capable of. I never said that SC wouldn\\'t save a bunch of lives (particularily the single vehicle kind of accidents). The \\'low\\' tolerance settings on many of these SC systems is much more common than you think, and not necessarily just based on that Sonata I \\'tested\\'. Many Sonata owners here, I\\'m sure, would testify that they have been driving their cars for a year or two and have never experienced any SC intervention. In that particular car it is not that invasive, in BMWs (MBs and Porsches come to mind as well) case I guess we are going to agree that it is not invasive at all. Toyota/Lexus both seemingly take a more aggressive approach in their SC programming perhaps heeding their lawyers advice too much. There is a reason why a non SC AWD Fusion V6 will outhandle and be more fun to drive (despite having maybe half the engine) than a softly suspended FWD Camry XLE V6 equipped with SC - and it is not just because of the \\'loose suspension\\'.  They just don\\'t have it in their cars and that\\'s not just them. OK, true it is an extra cost option on I think all the cars in this group except for Hyundai where it is standard and that one laggard Ford where, of course it is not even available. Talk about being in the forefront? Maybe Ford should be a truck manufacturer and not a car manufacturer.Whoops, hasn\\'t this already happened?  The mandate for standard ESC came out last month, so I\\'m not sure how Ford could have known a few years ago about this mandate. Why pick on Ford re ESC? Hyundai has standard ESC on the Sonata, but ESC is not even available on its mid-sized Elantra, and it\\'s optional (and not available on all trims) on Kia\\'s Optima. ESC is optional on the Camry, not available on I4 Accords, optional on the Altima, rare on GM mid-sizers, etc.  Maybe Ford should be a truck manufacturer and not a car manufacturer.Whoops, hasn\\'t this already happened?I think you are right Captain2. That would seem to be the trend wouldn\\'t it? Our local dealer, Sherwood Ford, Lincoln, Mercury of Salisbury, Md., has more Ford trucks on his lot than anything else.There were hundreds to choose from but there were only eight Fusions when we bought ours. For the last six weeks he has only had two Fusions to choose from.One of the sales managers told me he wished they had even more trucks to sell, the demand is that high. Of course, the F-150 is FoMoCo\\'s bread and butter these days. Once upon a time that honor was held by the Taurus.Sherwood is a very successful dealer and a very good one to deal with, too. I wouldn\\'t go anywhere else for service.  of course they did - IHTSA makes annoucements like this after consulting with the major mfgrs. meaning what they (the IHTSA) would like to do vs what is possible for the mfgrs. to do. Do you really think that Ford, for example, accidentally, has announcements prepared for the following day outlining their plans for compliance? Would guess the same thing happens with changes in CAFE standards as well. GM would logically figure to be slightly behind the technology curve as well (it all has something to do with money) - but their most current car in this class the Aura comes with SC (in XR trim) soon to be followed by the rebadged 08 Malibu. As I said in my previous post, SC is optional (or standard) in all the cars in this group except for the Fusion.  Only the Mazdaspeed6 has stability control, it is not available in any other Mazda6.Wooohooo  Justification at last. Honey, I need the 270 hp awd 93 octane turbo car because it has stability control... :P  It was also optional on the Focus way back in 2001 and nobody wanted it. I\\'m sure that factored into the decision of whether to offer it on the first gen Fusion. And they\\'re selling all the Fusions they can make right now with minimal incentives so it\\'s obviously not hurting sales.  yep, I believe that the F-150 #1 and the Silverado #2 each far outsell even the Camry/Accord - to the tune of 750,000 copies a year each. Supposedly even higher profit margins in trucks than there is in cars, and yet neither Ford or GM can make money overall - perhaps a testimony of how much money they must be losing trying to manufacture and sell cars!Down here in Texas, a pickup truck or some sort of SUV easily make up 60%-70% of what you see on your way to work.  if Fusions were selling real well and they were \\'selling all they can make\\' - there would be NO incentives. The reason why you might have an awfully long wait for those precious incentives on things like Camcords. And I would imagine the only thing that factored in any decision to put in a little more sophisticated braking system and some associated electronic crappola was MONEY...   Honey, I need the 270 hp awd 93 octane turbo car because it has stability control... and maybe the last place where you would want it   a sad commentary of the state of things of at Ford, given that all the mfgrs. knew several years in advance of the upcoming \\'mandate\\'...And this whole PC push, is largely a knee-jerk reaction to some poorly designed FORD SUVs on some crappy tires. Ford should not be lauded for being about the last to comply, they should have been in the forefront.Ford Bashing once again, huh?No wonder why Pat gets so annoyed, considering that \"manufacturer issues\" and \"manufacturer vs. manufacturer\" isn\\'t to be discussed here.On-topic:But over the last few days I have noticed a few new Kia Optima\\'s on the road. I also noticedd the ones I am seeing are v6 models that look loaded. Looks like the secrets out. Just out of curiosity I\\'m going to go test drive one this weekend and see how they feel/look.I too have seen a lot of new Optimas on the road. My wife\\'s looking into a new car this summer, and it\\'s on her list, because she likes how it looks. It\\'s growing on me as well...  Just vacuum cleaned our Fusion today. I was surprised at how cheap and flimsy the carpeting was. I wasn\\'t expecting a wool carpet but this stuff is really cheesy. Bean counters at work?How is the carpeting in other mid-sized sedans? It\\'s not something that I ordinarily notice when new-car shopping since carpeting is standard in all. It really is noticeable in the Fusion when you break out the vacuum though.  Given that most of the carpeting has 1 or 2 floor mats over it, it seems like automakers in general have taken to minimizing the carpeting in their vehicles, especially at the commodity car price points. The last LS430 I rode in had beautiful carpeting and leather surfaces, while more mainstay CamCordSions aren\\'t so fancy. I have yet to replace the carpeting in a modern (post-1970s) vehicle due to wear. What did you have before the Fusion? Does the Fusion seem comparable to what is in the Focus?  What did you have before the Fusion? Does the Fusion seem comparable to what is in the Focus?We traded a 2000 Mazda Miata (with 7,500 honest miles on it) in on the Fusion. The carpeting seemed OK. I honestly believe the carpeting in our 2000 Ford Focus station wagon is of slightly better (more durable) than what\\'s on the Fusion. Maybe it\\'s my imagination but what\\'s in the Fusion seems flimsy enough to have come from Wal-Mart.Guess I\\'m going to have to invest in some full-sized rubber mats, or carpeted ones, from Wal-Mart to protect the Fusion\\'s flooring. It is noticeably thin.Given what cars cost today, you would think that carpeting would matter, that it would be of descent quality, without having to move up to a Lexus or Caddy.The carpeting is not something that the professional car reviewers usually mention. Indeed, I didn\\'t even notice it in our Fusion until I applied the vacuum.The best I ever had was in a 1957 Cadillac that I owned in 1964-66. That stuff was plush and durable. I sure do miss that car; have many fond memories of it.  despite joe131s protestions otherwise cars as well as many other things really don\\'t cost more today than they did in \\'57. At a simple 6% rate of inflation, the $3500.00 (I\\'m guessing) that Cadillac costed is now the same as over $64000.00 today (6% compounded over 50 years). Think you could buy a nice Cadillac (or two) for 64 grand?Have our wages kept up, closer than you would think since back then $10k was damn near doctor\\'s wages, and 3 or 4k was a normal \\'white collar\\' wage. Do most of us get raises and/or cost of living wage increases that cover those kind of increases, generally yes. Are things built more cheaply despite all of this - maybe so, the craftsmen has long since disappeared in this country and been replaced by accountants.  The carpeting of my 2006 Accord EX is much better feeling than that in my 1996 Accord LX. It isn\\'t something you\\'d want in your bedroom, but it is fairly thick feeling.  The carpeting of my 2006 Accord EX is much better feeling than that in my 1996 Accord LX.That difference may be more about LX vs. EX, than 06 vs. 96. I know in 92 the materials used in the EX (seats, carpeting) were of better quality in the EX than the LX.  Seating, yes, there is a difference (a friend of mine has a 1994 EX Accord with gray cloth). Carpeting, I\\'m not so sure there\\'s a difference.  They built in a $500 rebate to the pricing because many buyers still won\\'t buy without some incentive. It\\'s been there since day 1 even when inventories were low so there is no other explanation. IF they weren\\'t selling well there would be at least $2K on the hood.  In my region there are incentives on Camry and Honda is offering \"low APR\" on all Accords and Civics..   Yep. My dad is looking to get his second Civic (he\\'s in Oklahoma City now), and was told they have 2.9 APR right now (they moved there in February, and the neighbor is a Honda dealer!:)). Final-year Accords are going for great discounts in anticipation of the new for 2008 model, as well. Whatdya know, they DON\\'T cost $5000 more than the competition. :-)  >Final-year Accords are going for great discountsI love that statement. I recall when the Honda folks would brag arrogantly how Honda NEVER had to use discounts and rebates, heaven forbid, to sell their product because they were so desirable...   For some reason, the new Accord looks much better in a darker color...  Guess I\\'m going to have to invest in some full-sized rubber mats, or carpeted ones, from Wal-Mart to protect the Fusion\\'s flooring. It is noticeably thin. Go to link title (weathertech\\'s website)and search for custom cut floor liners for your car. They\\'re awesome.  from the front it looks like an altima, and from the back and side it looks like a hyundai sonata...doesn\\'t really look honda-ish anymore...honda always had a distinguishable (if bland) look...-thene   I don\\'t know, I think I am more partial to the silver WRX going the other way in the first picture.Anyway, my next question is where are they? They have Ohio MFG plates, but I am thinking they are in California heading to a ski resort area. I haven\\'t seen another state have the \"inverted\" rumble strip type thing on the center line like that.  Go to link title (weathertech\\'s website)and search for custom cut floor liners for your car. They\\'re awesome.Wow! They sure are pricey. When you say they are \"awesome\" I assume you are speaking from experience? If so, how long have you had yours? Did you get the $99 version or the $149 one?  Maybe some of you noticed that the Taurus and Sable are now IIHS \"Top Safety Picks\". Yes, they are classed as \"large cars\" by interior volume, but then so is the Sonata. I also noticed how many Honda and Toyota sedans are IIHS Top Safety Picks: zero. Since the Taurus (ok, Five Hundred for now) is available in my town for around $18k well equipped, an excellent price for a V6 sedan, I expect many buyers will cross-shop it with mid-sizers. If Ford doesn\\'t offer ESC on the Fusion for 2008, maybe the Taurus will steal sales from the Fusion.  I see a lot of resemblance to the Optima, except the taillights, which do look to me like (truncated) Sonata or Lexus lamps. Since Honda obviously did not set out to mimic a Kia, it just shows once again that there are only so many wants to bend sheet metal on a sedan.  I\\'d have considered the 500/newTaurus, except for the lack of telescoping steering wheel. Not being a fan of the chrome grill on the Fusion, I doubt I will like the newTaurus. Although...I happened to recently see a caravan of the new Taurus and TaurusX being tested...the Taurus grill was covered up but the TaurusX looked like they had a \"black chrome\" grill (unless that was just a disguise).  I haven\\'t seen another state have the \"inverted\" rumble strip type thing on the center line like that.Washington state has those on the sides of many roads now.... separating the lane from the shoulder.  I don\\'t know, I think I am more partial to the silver WRX going the other way in the first picture. Anyway, my next question is where are they? They have Ohio MFG plates, but I am thinking they are in California heading to a ski resort area. I haven\\'t seen another state have the \"inverted\" rumble strip type thing on the center line like that. I hope no one from Honda is monotoring this thread if all we notice in the pics of their new bread and butter model are the rumble strips on the road. :P  Maryland has rumble strips, on the right lane, where the shoulder begins, on most of its state routes.  I don\\'t know, I think I am more partial to the silver WRX going the other way in the first picture. Anyway, my next question is where are they? They have Ohio MFG plates, but I am thinking they are in California heading to a ski resort area.

I hope no one from Honda is monotoring this thread if all we notice in the pics of their new bread and butter model are the rumble strips on the road. :P  Washington state has those on the sides of many roads now.... separating the lane from the shoulder.Yeah but those are in the middle under the double yellow. I thought the road from Mammouth up to the lodge and the June Lake loop were like that, I figured a lot of the roads around the California mtn ranges had it.Botts dots would get scraped off by the plows, although sometimes they put the Botts dot in the depression grove.  There\\'s a difference in using them in the first or second year of production of the model, and the end of the model run. Who would be dumb enough to pay full price on a car that will be \"obsolete\" in four months? Not even a \"dumb ole Honda buyer\" apparently! :-)I do, however, hope it wasn\\'t me you were referring to with the \"arrogantly bragging\" statement, because I don\\'t think I\\'ve EVER said Honda never had to use discounts. Maybe, you were just making a statement out of the context of my post instead? Maybe?  from the front it looks like an altimaI\\'m not seeing it, sorry. The Altima has very stretched vertical headlights, where the Accord has horizontal ones.  Have a thing against Ford Motor Company I see...   yeah, only about $3,000 more... :P  I\\'m very surprised here. Not much character, or stand-out styling. Front looks like an old Saturn, And the rear looks like a Sonata! Hope this isn\\'t a new Honda Accord.. or they are going to be in really big trouble..  A loaded EX-V6 Accord (no Navi) is all over the prices paid forum for $23k-$24k. In all honesty, is a like-equipped Fusion SEL-V6 (with the $3,335 in options required to equip it similarly to the Accord) going for $20k-$21k? That would be about $6,000 below MSRP for a Fusion, or more than 20% off.  Its a Ford product Backy, this is why people don\\'t want to notice! The Taurus (500) is a great value of a car. Get it with AWD and it can\\'t be beat for value/performance/quality/safety.. yet the media chooses to ignore it. Looks good now too with the new grill and tail lights.  Hope this isn\\'t a new Honda Accord.. or they are going to be in really big trouble.. What a surprise, you don\\'t like the Honda. I could\\'ve bet money that you wouldn\\'t!If you ask me, it is one of the more cohesive designs in the class. Beats the Camry handliy (what\\'s with that beak on the hood, and the fluffy look of the body?). If Toyota can sell 450,000 Camries, Honda won\\'t have a problem moving this Accord design unless the interior goes downhill.That\\'s ok. I\\'m struggling to see the Saturn you are talking about in the front end though, I really am. If anything, I\\'d say it has a mix between the TL and the Odyseey in front-end design.Styling is all purely subjective, as we all know.  Midsize sedans, or manufacturer news & views?I find it very entertaining that you think people don\\'t buy a car because of the media.What bad media has there been about Ford products? The media doesn\\'t typically make a big deal about mid-model changes. Honda added horsepower and redesigned the rear of the Accord COMPLETELY. I didn\\'t see an article about it until a comparison involving the new 2006 Fusion, and even then, the article wasn\\'t about the redesigned Accord.  C\\'mon Grad. You got to stop trying to convince people that Honda products are actually less expensive than Ford products. It is common knowledge to anyone that has been around and shopped around knows Honda vehicles are priced at premium prices and dealers don\\'t deal. Get out on the net, you will see people paying $25K-27K for Accord v6 EX, add NAV and it jumps to 28-30K. Just like the guy I spoke of that paid $19,750 for a Civic EX automatic! no nav and he thought he got a good deal?? :surprise: I don\\'t think you can option a Focus out to even reach $16,000... :shades: I traded in a 2001 Ford Escape XLT v6 with 75,000 miles. they gave me $11,000. Paid $23,000 for the Fusion SEL v6, leather, sunroof, heated seated, the works. I also got 0% financing.. I am thousands ahead of if I would have bought an Accord.. My car will be paid for in about 3 years.  C\\'mon Grad. You got to stop trying to convince people that Honda products are actually less expensive than Ford products.I\\'ll just wait here while you show me where I did that.Get out on the net, you will see people paying $25K-27K for Accord v6 EX, add NAV and it jumps to 28-30K.I AM out on the net, on this very site. That\\'s where I got the prices I gave you. Anyone reading this should hop over to the Honda Accord prices paid forum and see the prices. Less than $24k for the EX V6, add about $1,500-$2000 for NAVI (making it less than $26,000).Maybe instead of repeating your in-credible information, you should check out the Accord forum and see for yourself.  Hope this isn\\'t a new Honda Accord.. or they are going to be in really big trouble.. I doubt it. If you put wheels on a bathtub and threw a honda badge on the front, people would buy it.and then they\\'d come on this board and post about it being the best wheeled bathtub in the world :P  I got my Ex-L V6 for $23695 last month - nircdocThere had been a few deals for around $23,500 (for EXV6) (include Destination) and even better. Common deals are around $23,800. - nighthawk326EXV6 $23,651 - joensuefayNo trade-in. Did not use Dealer Financing. Earlier this month (April 7th, 2007). I purchased 2007 Honda Accord 4dr SEDAN EX-L V-6 Automatic Transmission with Navigation for $25,061.76 (NOT INCLUDING MARYLAND TAX AND TAGS). - ballroomdancer  Not everyone. Mine would be the best bathtub \"for me\" but not for you necessarily.  To be fair, It\\'s a reputation they\\'ve earned. Personaly, I think the accord is a very good car, and worth the extra money you (usually) pay for one. came very, very close to buying one. In the end, it was only my past reliability experience with nissan, and the fact the accord redesign wasn\\'t out yet that put me in the altima. But as reliable as my wife\\'s civic has been; if I\\'d been buying in 2008 instead of 2007, I may very well have bought an accord. It deffinitly finished runner up in my car search.  You got the 2007 Altima? Cool! How are you liking it so far? The CVT in a mainstream sedan intrigues me. Is it the 2.5, and if it is, what kind of mileage are you seeing from it?   If you put wheels on a bathtub and threw a honda badge on the front, people would buy it. As long as they keep making the highest quality bathtubs, you bet we will.   I got the 2.5s. so far, the car is great. The CVT is amazing, I really think its going to be the future of transmissions. Whats nice about it is, It deffinitly makes the car move faster. Its hard to describe, but it always maintains the perfect gear ratio, without having to dog the engine, and can do it with such ease. I guess the best way to explain it would be tachometer (at any speed) can fluctuate from 1500-5000 rpm in a matter of seconds, just by how much gas you give it. You can be cruising 60 mph at 1800 rpm, push the gas in all the way, and the engine will rev (in an instant) up around 5000 rpm. But as soon as you let off the gas, it will drop back to about 1800. And you never feel it at all. You could almost confuse the tachometer with the speedometer. And driving it normally, I\\'ll often notice that the rpms are going down while I\\'m speeding up. very weird. :surprise: The I-key is also pretty neat. Totally impossible to lock you key in it. Lock and close the doors with the key inside, the car automaticly unlocks all four dors and starts beeping and screaming at you. leave it in the trunk and close the lid, and the trunk automaticly opens itself. The car will also give a warning on the HUD if you close the door with the car running if the key is not in the car. That way, you won\\'t drive off without it.As for the milage, I\\'ve been driving it mostly mixed, and getting about 29-30 mpg. But I haven\\'t done much open road driving yet, and I\\'ve heard the milage isn\\'t as good the first couple thousand miles. Supposedly the car is programed to burn a richer fuel mixture for a couple thousand miles for break-in purposes.  Sounds like a great car. I didn\\'t realize the keyless ignition did all that, what a smart idea. I\\'ve nearly closed the trunk on my keys a couple of times, and caught it at the last second. I\\'ve been in a car with CVT once in my life (a Honda Insight of all things - what a tiny tin can!) and it was the weirdest thing to me as well, although I\\'m sure I\\'d get used to it. 29-30 MPG is about what I average in my 06 2.4L Accord and that is a mix of city and highway, without being real racy in my style (4,000 RPM is tops for me most days). Sounds like your Altima is returning similar mileage, with a little more horsepower! Sweet!  How true. The Accord has never been a style leader, although the Gen 3 sedan and coupe were pretty swoopy for their time, with retractable headlamps and all. I think Honda aims for clean styling that won\\'t offend a lot of people. That is the way to sell lots of cars. That, and the long-term quality reputation.  I know I\\'m biased since I have one, but the Gen 5 (1994-1997) Accord had the best combination of being unoffensive yet stylish with the shoulder line that ran the length of the car.  I think with any nissan car (especially the altima because it uses a better version) you have to go with the cvt. Their MT\\'s arn\\'t bad, but deffintly lagg behind the competion. Bassed on my test driving, I\\'d have to give honda the nod when it comes to manual transmissions. By far the smoothest I\\'ve driven. I\\'d put the camry at #2, then most every other midsize, and nissan at or near the bottom. It\\'s deffinitly their weakest area, IMO.  The only Nissan stick I\\'ve ever driven was the vehicle I actually learned to drive a stick in - 1999 Nissan Frontier XE 4-cylinder.Doesn\\'t stick out in my mind as being bad, but then again, I drove this before I drove a Civic stickshift, and haven\\'t gone back to another since then. A sedan\\'s will be very different from a truck (should be much better, no?)  They\\'re not horrible, but if you drive around in an accord manual for awhile, then hop in nissan manual, you\\'ll deffinitly notice the difference. I don\\'t know if its because nissan has focused so much on the cvt, or honda has developed such good manuals (which i suspect), but you\\'ll deffinitly notice. Longer throws, more shift shock, and less power at the lower end of the gears are the most noticable.  http://www.carsdirect.com/build/options?zipcode=91107&acode=USB70HOC011A0&restor- e=falsePasadena, California(pretty much normal as can get West Coast). Select manual transmission.$15566 plus delivery($16161) Kind of puts it in perspective. All the substance, none of the bling. I\\'d take it over a Hyundai or GM small car anyday.  Through CarsDirect.comNo haggling for this price.The Fusion, when equipped like the Accord (adding Satellite Radio, Leather, Heated Seats, ABS, Traction Control (closest thing to Stability Assist), was $23,285 on the same site - no haggle price.The no haggle price difference is now less than $500  between Fusion and Accord on CarsDirect.com. Not $5000 as some would have you believe.Accord - $23,762Fusion - $23,285This includes the rebates on the Fusion.  In my zip code the Accord EX V6  is $25,164 on carsdirect.com. The Fusion SEL with the options you list is $22,327 there...adding moonroof (Accord EX has that, right?) puts the Fusion at $23,019. This is about a $2100 difference. The Fusion can also be had for $1000 more with 0.9% financing for 36 months. For most this will be worth more than the $1000.The Accord is in it\\'s last year, in a few months the difference will likely be at least $3000. I think the difference in price between Accord and cars like Fusion/Milan/Mazda6 is typically at least $2000 and as much as $3500. I know I paid $1700 less than carsdirect price for my Mazda6...this is $3800 less than carsdirect price of the comparable Accord. I suspect, at least in my market, that the Honda dealers would not discount to $1700 below carsdirect price, as the Mazda dealer did...but even if they did, the Accord would still be $2100 more than Mazda6.  The stripped Accord VP on carsdirect in my zip code comes in at $17,958 with automatic. That is still $2000 more than I, and many others, paid for Mazda6i sport value automatic (which is much better equipped...about like the Accord SE).  I drove this before I drove a Civic stickshift, and haven\\'t gone back to another since then.Being a manual tranny enthusiast I\\'d like to address this one. Every car we\\'ve bought in the past 11 years, 4 total, has been a stick. By far the worst shifter was in our \\'96 Civic (EX with VTEC) so I hope Honda has improved them since then. It had to be connected to the transmission with rubber bands. I have no other explanation for it. I\\'m sure the Civic you drove was much better than a truck but it was not a good experience for me.Actually I take that \"by far the worst\" comment back. The shifter in our \\'98 ZX2 was a bit rough too but not rubbery like the Civic\\'s.Since then the cars we\\'ve bought have gone up in status I guess you could say. The Mazda6 shifter was pretty nice but it\\'s clutch was tricky. Our Mustang\\'s Tremec T56 is like heaven compared to any of the others however. Given the press the Accord shifters have received I don\\'t doubt that the shifter is nice. Let\\'s just be careful of how much praise we give to Honda transmissions though. I personally don\\'t feel their track record is as stellar as we\\'re sometimes made to believe and I\\'d bet others would agree. Besides, for about the same price of a loaded Accord you can get a MAZDASPEED6 with, from what I\\'ve read again, a shifter that\\'s hard to beat.I do applaud Honda for offering an MTX with the V6 in the Accord though. Not many mfrs do that these days and it gives guys like me hope for the future. My kids are still small and fit in the Mustang just fine. Someday that will change and I\\'d like to have something great to fall back on at that time. :blush:  A manual transmission in a sedan? No thanks.  I like the Gen 5 Accord too, it\\'s my 2nd favorite after the Gen 3, and was more adventurous than the Gen 4 or Gen 6.I almost bought a Gen 5 LX coupe, but it was a little pricey and I leased a Mystique instead. Then right after I leased the Mystique, Honda put big lease incentives on the Accord.   Then right after I leased the Mystique, Honda put big lease incentives on the Accord.Go figure. The Mystique treated you well though, I imagine?  That is interesting. But I have a correction to make to your Fusion price. I used your link and zip code, and after adding ABS and Trac Ctl, Moonroof, Heated Leather, the top-end sound system with Satellite Radio, the price was:Target Price with selected options: $23,385copied and pasted from CarsDirect. Not sure what options you left off of the Fusion, but the Accord has all of the above standard (I selected the AudioPhile sound system because Edmunds\\' stereo evaluation ranked that system below the Accord EXV6\\'s standard system). $25,164 - $23,385 = $1,779.For $1,779 you get 23 horsepower, a smoother sounding engine, a more curvaceous interior without controls that can be found in many other models, Stability Control, and the best resale in its class.Of course, for someone who drives their car 20 years, doesn\\'t want stability control, likes square interior designs and a more growling engine and don\\'t mind lowest horsepower in the class (which is still plenty), the Fusion might just be money well-spent!It is all about personal taste and how you perceive the car. Scape asked me earlier to \"quit trying to convince everyone that the Accord is cheaper than the Fusion.\"I\\'ve never said that, and if I have, please show it to me. What I\\'m trying to do is just encourage people to read the Honda Accord Prices Paid forum. People report prices, often times, their initial quotes. When there are high prices, such as $27,500 for an Accord V6 with Navigation, other buyers will step in and tell them they can do better.Of course an intial offer is going to be higher than one you negotiate, because some people are still convinced that Hondas go for near sticker price. Once people learn that they aren\\'t, and enlighten the dealer to the knowledge they hold, the negotiation process takes a turn for the better (for the consumer). I\\'ve read that forum regularly, and the people getting the best prices are doing something very simple. Just bouncing internet quotes from one dealer to another until the best possible price is reached. No traveling from dealer to dealer is involved!  The 4th gen Accord was the last generation that was 4cylinder only. Later generations became larger and heavier, to accomodate the V6 engines. The 4th gen Accord handled better than many sports cars. The 5th gen had a lot of style in it\\'s profile, but I think the front and rear ends looked better on the 6th gen. Every generation had it\\'s highs and lows.  The gain in weight was only about 100 pounds from Gen IV (2,738 lbs) to Gen V (2,855 lbs). That\\'s the difference in one small person riding with you. Not too much heavier considering the added side-impact protection and extra airbag the Gen V added to the Gen IV.  The added weight was only one factor. The 5th gen also had a shorter wheel base, longer body, and softer suspension. They are all small increments, but they do add up.  A manual transmission in a sedan?No thanks.I\\'ll take my sedan with a manual, thank you very much... Just because a car has 4 doors doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t have some fun with it.  The reason you get a basic model(and the same VP with automatic is only $600-800 or so more) is that the chassis, suspension, brakes, and engine are all the same as the other models, or very close(the VP is missing a rear swaybar, but that\\'s easy to add back in for a couple of hundred dollars - bolts right in).You can get the same shifting, engine, and driving experience as the 4 cylinder EX for a silly low price.Now, the clutch isn\\'t fantastic. I\\'d rate it as good, though, or close to what you get in a typical European entry-level sport sedan. Definately a step up from everything else in this price-range, though. Not rubbery, not clunky. Smooth and adequate.That\\'s worth $500 more right there in my book. And the automatic isn\\'t bad, either - Honda makes nice autos. Far better than Hyundai or GM that\\'s for sure.  Yet another person jumps and and shows you that Honda Accords are generally $2-3,000 more than a like optioned Fusion and you still don\\'t believe it? \"For $1,779 you get 23 horsepower, a smoother sounding engine, a more curvaceous interior without controls that can be found in many other models, Stability Control, and the best resale in its class. \"a smoother sounding engine.. a more curvaceous interior.. All this in this paragraph is your opinion. You had better have higher resale value, YOU PAID MORE upfront..About the only thing Honda/Toyota are riding on right now is PAST reputation. As consumers start to figure out you don\\'t have to pay the high prices Honda/Toyota demand it is going to mean bad news for these automakers in the future. I visit about 6 other forums each day. I can tell you I run across at least 1 or 2 people that have decided to change to either a Nissan/Mazda/Hyundia/Subaru or some other brand other than an Accord or Camry. Granted, it doesn\\'t show on the sales charts. But these are NOT repeat buyers and that cannot be good for reputation.  These are advertised prices of Accords from a very large auto dealer that holds about 5-8 different models/dealers.2007 Accord VP $18,2092007 Accord SE $20,0882007 Acccord SEV6 $21,6482007 EX-LV6 25,278 leather,moonroof,alloys NO NAVAnother large dealer Accord Vp $18,188Accord LX 4cyl 5spd $19,588Accord SE $20,089Accord EX-LV6 - $25,278 NO NAVAs we all know these are leaders and are the lowest price you are probably going to get from the dealer. Want the dealer names/numbers let me know and I\\'ll e-mail them to you. Edmunds frowns on listing dealerships names/numbers.I also noticed Nissan is being very agressive with pricing of the new Altima. Altima 2.5 S for under $20,000 (automatics).. Very interesting..  One of the things that seem to negatively affect resale values seems to be how much a new car is discounted. Now that the Accord has discounts higher than I can ever remember would suggest that those who currently own an Accord will now have worse resales than before. I would think the coupes would be hit the worst since the styling differences between the current and next generation are the most dramatic with the next gen looking really good. Since most of the styling on the new sedan still appear to be on the sedate side like the current model, I doubt the style differences will result in a extra hit in negative resale.  It is all about personal taste and how you perceive the car. Scape asked me earlier to \"quit trying to convince everyone that the Accord is cheaper than the Fusion.\" Yes, and many people\\'s personal taste would be that the Fusion (or Milan or Mazda6) is a better looking car, and/or the base radio is fine and/or they don\\'t want a moonroof and/or ... I would not have any interest in these loaded up V6 models, myself. I only even looked at the pricing of them, because I was surprised at how small a difference someone was finding in CA. To me 200+ HP is overkill for these cars, the 150 or so in the I4s is adequate and I don\\'t want things like leather seats and moonroofs. I do understand that you have not claimed Accord is cheaper. The new one does look to be a better looking car (to me) than the current one. I did not give the current one much consideration because of the combination of it\\'s unappealing appearance and price of at least $2000 more than other cars I liked. Same deal with the Altima. It is pricier than some of the other choices and I don\\'t happen to like the way it looks, so I did not give it much consideration...in addition I found the seat to be uncomfortable.  I can tell you I run across at least 1 or 2 people that have decided to change to either a Nissan/Mazda/Hyundai/Subaru or some other brand other than an Accord or Camry. Granted, it doesn\\'t show on the sales charts. But these are NOT repeat buyers and that cannot be good for reputation. So obviously just as many (or more) people are changing from these other brands to Accord/Camry. These are potential repeat buyers down the road. People are realizing that Camry/Accord are worth the extra initial cost.  Yes, and many people\\'s personal taste would be that the Fusion (or Milan or Mazda6) is a better looking car, and/or the base radio is fine and/or they don\\'t want a moonroof and/or ... Exactly what I said.  My perfect car is certainly not yours, or elroy\\'s, or pat\\'s, etc...I do understand that you have not claimed Accord is cheaper.Thank you. If only everyone else would quit putting words in my mouth!  Accord are in fact more expensive. I\\'m through responding to the person who keeps trying to skew what I\\'ve said. Your post hsa both credence AND substance. How refreshing! :shades: The new one does look to be a better looking car (to me) than the current one. I did not give the current one much consideration because of the combination of it\\'s unappealing appearance and price of at least $2000 more than other cars I liked. I certainly agree that the new model appears (at least at this point) to have more style than the current 5-year old model. Of the top 3 high-points I\\'ve found out of my 06 Accord, exterior style wouldn\\'t be one of them (although I think it is nice looking, it isn\\'t \"beautiful\"). The best attributes I\\'ve found were:Interior design/ergonimic layout. The inside looks like a car costing more, to me.Powertrain. I have the 2.4L, and that engine is so sweet all the way to redline! Lots of pep, and fuel economy that belies its size and pep.Suspension tuning. This one surprises me (in a good way) the more miles I drive in it. The Accord had the right balance of sporty handling and smoothness on the bumpy interstate for my tastes. Tauter than most midsizers, but softer than the Fusion and 6.Since I spend most of the time INSIDE and DRIVING the car, these were three very important attributes to me. Lots of standard safety features were a bonus. (I won\\'t mention the individual features of the car, because just about all of those are available on other models in the class as well, so there would be no point).  I also noticed Nissan is being very agressive with pricing of the new Altima. Altima 2.5 S for under $20,000 (automatics).. Very interesting..  fairly hard to find one more than $100 or so under 20k. without options or destination, the invoice is almost 19100. just the freight charge will put it at 19700. add in floor mats and splash guards (which i\\'ve never seen a car without) and your up to 20k. Not very agressive to me.  Just because a car has 4 doors doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t have some fun with it. Shifting gears is fun? Maybe in a S2000 or a 330i OK, but in my daily driver - no way.  Maybe in a S2000 or a 330i OK, but in my daily driver - no way.I realize that I\\'m in a minority considering how few manuals are sold but I wouldn\\'t want to be without one.

I think it depends on what your daily drive is. if your daily drive involves stop and go city traffic, then I\\'d rather have an auto. ridding a clutch for 45 min without ever reaching 3rd is a pain in the [non-permissible content removed].In general though, I think a stick is always more fun to drive  2007 Accord VP $18,209 2007 Accord SE $20,088 2007 Acccord SEV6 $21,648 2007 EX-LV6 25,278 leather,moonroof,alloys NO NAV Another large dealer Accord Vp $18,188 Accord LX 4cyl 5spd $19,588 Accord SE $20,089 Accord EX-LV6 - $25,278 NO NAV ****Cars Direct Pricing - WITH AUTOMATIC AND DELIVERY INCLUDED!.Accord VP - CarsDirect Price: $16,883Accord LX - CarsDirect Price: $18,246Accord SE - CarsDirect Price: $18,884Accord LX V6 CarsDirect Price: $22,054Accord EX V6 CarsDirect Price: $23,762This completely blows a hole in the \"too expensive\" argument.

If your dealer is quoting a dime more than Cars Direct, shop elsewhere.  I really liked the ride and handling on the Mystake. Also it was a 5-speed stick with ABS and traction control, a very rare combination on a moderately-priced I4 car in 1995. But it was in the shop many times for various glitches and recalls. And the residual was ridiculous. So I didn\\'t buy it after the 2-year lease ran out.  Maybe the other brands are GM, Ford & Chrysler.  I\\'ve always heard similar things about that car (the Contour, anyways). Based on what I\\'ve read (I\\'ve never driven one), the Contour offered dynamics similar to the Fusion, which is a good thing if you actually ENJOY driving .A 5-speed manual with ABS and traction control is a big deal to find on a 4-cylinder car NOW, much less 1995. What a find!  Yes, although one of the things that always impressed me about the Gen 3 Elantra was that it offered that same combination (stick, ABS, traction) at a very low price point.Maybe the reason the Contique had such a good blend of ride and handling was that it, like the Focus, was designed to be a \"world car\", e.g. sold in Europe also, in this case as the Mondeo. I liked the way the Mystake drove so much that I almost bought a V6 model when they were being phased out, because I saw some offered (loaded) for around $12k. But then I thought about all the shop time. Plus I never found a V6 5-speed in a color I liked, at the closeout price. :blush:  This completely blows a hole in the \"too expensive\" argument. Hmm...does this completely blow a hole in the Honda does not put incentives on the Accord and lower the resale value arguement too :surprise: . Isn\\'t it a sign of a problem with future resale value for the Accord when (based on 4 cyl SE) it is discountred more than a Fusion in CA? The Accord SE is selling at about $3500 below MSRP, while the Fusion is at about $2300 below MSRP.There must be some sort of dealer incentive in CA, In my zip code, the Accord SE Automatic shows up at $19,946 on cars direct. The comparable Fusion SE with AT and ABS is at $18,349 and the comparable Mazda6 SVE with AT is at $17,840.It\\'s not a \"too expensive\" argument (at least not from me), that would be a subjective judgement. The fact is the Accord costs more than a Fusion or Mazda6, to some it is worth the extra cost to others it is not. I\\'d have passed on the Accord, even if the price were the same as a Mazda6. However, if the Accord were $2000 less than the 6, then I would have surely given it more consideration than I did.  Isn\\'t it a sign of a problem with future resale value for the Accord when (based on 4 cyl SE) it is discountred more than a Fusion in CA? Well, considering the Accord\\'s resale is best-in-class and that rebates are being offered only now that it is due for a complete overhaul, I\\'m gonna say it sure doesn\\'t seem to be a problem. I\\'m not trying to sell my Accord at the moment, so I\\'m not going to talk about something in detail that I really don\\'t know about for sure. Those selling their Accords (2003-2007) should feel free to chime in and fill us in though. I\\'d be interested to know if the rebates are making that big of a difference in resale.  Cars.com established the Lifestyle Awards to recognize which vehicles were best suited for the lifestyle needs of today\\'s car buyers. After an exhaustive analysis, the 2007 Honda Accord was named the Best New Car for Small Families. According to Cars.com, \"The Accord is the most well-rounded midsize sedan &#151; the class of choice for families who want out of SUVs and their high fuel costs. The Accord has it all: good gas mileage, predicted reliability, quality, comfort, resale value and crash-test results. It\\'s even a little sporty. The four-cylinder should do the trick for most buyers, and the optional V-6 will please the rest. The Accord is a best-seller, and for very good reasons.\"  Have a four cylinder Optima, and IMHO, this is the only compelling deal with Kia. Unless they are REALLY discounted, I\\'d buy the Sonata if I was interested in a V-6. There is very little power difference between the six and four with the Optima. All you get is an older engine that is more complicated, has a timing belt, and uses more gas. If you want fancy, Kia does put a four into the EX. I was able to get an LX with after market leather (which looks very good), and seventeen inch Michelins for sixteen grand. Other than power seats it gives up little compared to the EX.  Today a dealer near me has an add for Mazda6 SVE, presumably manual trans, at $13,995 (can one get even a civic at this price?). This is about a $6000 discount from MSRP. The dealership with this ad is always very straightforward when they advertise prices (which they don\\'t do very often), so pretty sure there are no games associated with this...the only ad-on (besides TTL) would be a $99 document/service fee. Clearly carsdirect is not giving a good price on this car...total discounts plus rebates of $5000-6000 off MSRP have been available all year. Honda dealers around here tend not to advertise purchase price much, instead they advertise leases. So I did not see any prices for that model. Three year leases for VP are advertised at $199, which is also advertised for Fusion S...both have similar deposits, etc. required. This is more evidence that for short-term owners there is little difference.For the Fusion, ads are showing only about $2500 off MSRP, including the $1000 rebate, for general customers. They have some special college student and lease renewal rebates also shown in the ads for another $1500 off.  The 08 Accord combines Optima and Sonata styling clues. Where are those way ahead of the curve Accords of 20 years ago? Honda has become more and more conservative with each passing generation. Can\\'t quite figure it out, but you can\\'t question that it\\'s successful for continuing to nab those that don\\'t look at every possibility every time they buy a new car.

The 08 Accord combines Optima and Sonata styling clues. Where are those way ahead of the curve Accords of 20 years ago? Honda has become more and more conservative with each passing generation. Its just because of their target customer. IMO (and only my opinion) honda targets 40 something mid-level professionals with 2 or less kids. Kind of the poor mans BMW or mercedes.  Hmm...does this completely blow a hole in the Honda does not put incentives on the Accord and lower the resale value arguement too .

The Accord SE is selling at about $3500 below MSRP, while the Fusion is at about $2300 below MSRP. ****IIRC, there\\'s no difference or discount out here. Just that there\\'s a LOT of margin in Hondas between actual cost and MSRP. Several thousand in fact. Even the Fit has a good thousand or so margin.But I don\\'t really care, either - if Cars Direct is selling it for that low, it\\'s legitimate. I think the price difference is how close to a major city it is/some sort of delivery charge. Try typing in a major city like Saint Louis or Altanta.With Cars Direct, if they say \"target price\", it means they don\\'t have it in actual inventory/a real price to offer you. When they have inventory sitting around, the discounts are much higher - so you often have to try several cities in your state to find the best price. And this is true for individual models as well - so an Accord VP may be hard to find, but a LX will be all different price ranges. But ther are some deals to be had. OR you can haggle, though Cars Direct is good to show them, because they have to beat it if they want to make a sale.   Well, if we can continue to hash out the Ford commercial and its results, I figured I\\'d put out some real third party praise for the Accord, instead of my own.  You\\'re right that the present generation is more conservative, especially the early models whose rear quarters resembled Buicks. The new one is better.The late eighties cars were truly cutting edge. Far more daring than Camry\\'s of the same era and way above most of the competition. That\\'s no longer true.  I don\\'t remember a non-conservative Accord since 1990. I don\\'t mean they have been bad-looking (I\\'m partial to the 1994-1997 design) but they certainly have been conservative for nearly 20 years.  Agree completely, including that the 94-97\\'s were the best looking of the bunch.  The Legacy is my personal favourite, its a really under rated Camry/Accord alternative. It is available with a six speed manual, looks really good, has a turbo charged engine, what more can you ask for? You actually control the car, when you steer the car you feel where it is on the road, you feel how its handling, how it is breaking. Instead of getting no response and completely unresponsive, mushy breaks on the Camry. The Camry is really just an appliance, a white good. It will never be as fun or good looking as the Legacy or Aura. It maybe good quality, but there is no soul there, no passion. Something I need in a car.  not that invoice means too much (generally about MSRP*.9), but any car mfgr out there (that is making money), will generally not exceed 60% in direct mfg. costs including labor. So therefore this $20k Accord that invoices for $18k, likely costs Honda maybe $11k to make. This rest, of course, goes to cover overhead, insurances, taxes, and profit. If those kind of margins bother you, than you better stay home and keep your money in your mattress - these kind of margins are normal for anybody that actually manufactures almost anything. If you are expecting even GM/Ford/Chrysler to base pricing on actual cost to manufacture, or even feel that they aren\\'t entitled to it - about all I can say is don\\'t hold your breath.And sure, the fact that Honda is discounting a little more than usual right now on the last year before a model year change is not strange at all - and will have a negative effect on resale values - although I would be willing to bet that resale values won\\'t go down (on a percentage basis) as much as the \\'drive out\\' prices have - making them even more of a true \\'value\\' then they were a year ago.  Well, considering the Accord\\'s resale is best-in-class and that rebates are being offered only now that it is due for a complete overhaul, I\\'m gonna say it sure doesn\\'t seem to be a problem.Someone else can probably verify but IIRC Accords were being discounted $3000 - $4000 last year during the end of the model year run. I do remember Edmunds showing a \"Manufacturer to Dealer\" \"Marketing Support\" incentive of $3000 and I\\'m pretty sure it was as high as $4000 at one time. As I understand it, this cash is not on the hood but is available to the dealer if they really need to make sales. So not everyone saw it when they bought an Accord during that time last year. I\\'m not writing this to imply that there\\'s a problem with the Honda resale formula mind you. I just wanted to point out that they do at times offer a good bit of cash even if it is handed out at the dealer\\'s discretion. Cash like that also allows them to print those outrageous ads showing a car for a crazy low price, then you walk in the door looking for that deal (the bait), and finally walk out with a different car (the switch).   >Cash like that also allows them to print those outrageous ads showing a car for a crazy low price, then you walk in the door looking for that deal (the bait), and finally walk out with a different car (the switch).And you walk out with a whole lot less of the (secret) discount that most customers don\\'t know about but the dealer knows to keep his hands on.  I actually had a Honda dealer try to pull that one on me a few years ago. They were advertising a new Accord at a good price. Wife and I went and liked at the car, and, told the salesman we\\'d take it. The guy just walked away from us, and, never came back. After standing around for 30 minutes, we left and bought a similar car at another dealership.Regards:Oldengineer  And sure, the fact that Honda is discounting a little more than usual right now on the last year before a model year change is not strange at all -agreed. its easier for them to rebate heavily now at the end of this generations run. You have to figure all the design and engineering costs have been paid for. From what I understand, when a company makes a new car, or redesigns an existing one, the guess how many units they will sell of it. They use that number to spread all the development costs over. being as the accord probably sold a good bit more units than anticipated, it probably generates more profit than it did 3 years ago. and, there is more room to lower the price.  >You have to figure all the design and engineering costs have been paid for.But they need that profit to pay for the development of the new version!!!The logic doesn\\'t wash about the discounting. They are incentives and they aren\\'t even above board to all customers like other companies are.  I don\\'t have a problem with them making a profit, just that Honda has a very hefty margin, especially when optioned out. It\\'s not uncommon to see invoice and MSRP have a several thousand dollar spread, so there\\'s tons of room to haggle if you bother to try.   I do remember Edmunds showing a \"Manufacturer to Dealer\" \"Marketing Support\" incentive of $3000 and I\\'m pretty sure it was as high as $4000 at one time. As I understand it, this cash is not on the hood but is available to the dealer if they really need to make sales. So not everyone saw it when they bought an Accord during that time last year. Try $750 for sedans and $1,000 for coupes last year. Not the thousands of dollars you claim. I\\'m pretty darn sure I\\'m not mistaken on this, but would love a link proving me otherwise.  Well, went to the nearest Kia dealer and was almost mugged! 4 guys ran out and tried to grab me away from each guy. finally I said I was only hear for a test drive, not to buy. So, I was stuck with the 18 year old kid..Took an Optima v6 loaded model out for a spin. Styling I would give it a B-. Fit/finish was actually very good. doors closed with a solid sound, panels looked all tight and well put together. Dash was well laid out. Plastics felt a little flimsy at places. Drove pretty nice however for a family sedan. Power of the V6 was ample. You weren\\'t going to win any races, but it pulled the car just fine. Overall, not bad. Would I buy one. No, styling not for me. But for someone looking for a value family sedan  Today a dealer near me has an add for Mazda6 SVE, presumably manual trans, at $13,995 (can one get even a civic at this price?). This is about a $6000 discount from MSRP. The dealership with this ad is always very straightforward when they advertise prices (which they don\\'t do very often), so pretty sure there are no games associated with this...the only ad-on (besides TTL) would be a $99 document/service fee. Clearly carsdirect is not giving a good price on this car...total discounts plus rebates of $5000-6000 off MSRP have been available all year.That\\'s amazing that it\\'s being the Mazda6 is being discounted so much already. Or pretty sad. But besides the good press at the beginning of the year (edmund\\'s editors most desired sedan, consumer\\'s digest sportiest cars), the 6 hardly gets a mention. Even in the last Altima Coupe review on Edmunds who\\'s biggest point was it\\'s sportiness, they chose to compare it to the Pontiac G6 (presumably because it is a coupe also) but not the true solid handling car in this segment the Mazda6. Most of the press that the 6 is getting over the last couple months has to do with the next generation which won\\'t be released for another year! So I geuss I\\'m not surprised the Mazda6 is being discounted so much, but that does offer some good opportunities for the value shoppers or those who desire a stylish midsize car that\\'s fun to drive. And captain... what is your source for saying a 20k accord costs 11k to manufacture :surprise: ? Sounds a bit off to me...  i just drove the Aura XR yesterday (may 19).sweet ride! everybody keeps saying \"camry, camry..\" but honestly this car is awesome,,, plenty of power, looks great, the center dash layout (stereo/ac) looks real nice,, i was ready to buy it.only thing, after reading these forums i was expecting to get a little better deal. if he had offered better numbers i would have taken it despite the so-so mpg. the 20/28 mpg was the only real downer.  Yes, I think the 6 is a great buy and a mostly a secret. I really only discovered the 6 myself because of the Fusion. I had really liked driving the contour and have ususally found Ford seats to be comfortable. So I was anxious to try the Fusion, thinking maybe it would be the new contour. I really liked driving the Fusion and seats were comfortable, but did not care for the appearance...so after finding out it was based on the 6, I tried out the better looking parent.I have a, just graduated, kid that may need to replace a car soon (my old \\'95 5 speed manual Contour with 150K mi), if she gets a job and needs a car to get to it, I just may encourage her to consider a new mazda6 rather than spending $4-5K on a junk-mobile...$14K for a nice new car like the Mazda6 SVE is a fantastic bargain, IMO.  But they need that profit to pay for the development of the new version!!! thats part of the profits. the way I understand it, when pricing a car, the manufacture factors in the actual cost of production, a certain of profit margin, and the development and engineering costs divided by the number of units they expect to sell. Now, if the car sells twice as many units as expected, the pre-production costs will be paid much earlier and the profit margin will increase quite a bit. Hence, they can lower the price and still maintain the originally desired profit margin. That would explain the heavier discounting in the last year of production.thats just speculation on my part, but does seem to explain why the price of top selling cars seem to drop in the last year.  the \\'Japanese\\'mfgrs. have a heftier profit margin because they are not so bogged down in \\'suits\\', labor obligations etc. and because their US plants are newer and more efficient. Cost of production is less and the overhead is less. A situation that is changing as the \\'American\\' mfgrs. become \\'Canadian and Mexican\\' mfgrs. now largely operating out from under the UAW.GM in its \\'banner year\\' of 05, it was said they were losing $2500.00 on every car they sold, a number that precisely equalled just their pension obligations per car. And a good part of that loss was due to GM having to \\'sell\\' their cars at 20 or 30% discounts - quite a bit different situation than we are seeing with Honda right now. Invoice, that admittedly ficticious number, will generally always be between 10-15% below MSRP (2-3k in this group), I challenge you to name any car that is more than that (they are published numbers). Buying anything based simply on how much \\'haggling\\' you can do, is however, dangerous in that you are much more likely to end up with an inferior product, and also may not really be saving you any money at all simply because cheap now will usually equal cheap later. I feel sorry for those folks that ran out and bought a 6 let\\'s say at \\'invoice\\' only to find the same car available several months later for 3 or 4 grand cheaper eefectively getting \\'upside down\\' on their car notes in a real hurry- a chance you really take when that badge doesn\\'t say Honda or Toyota.  I\\'ve always heard similar things about that car (the Contour, anyways). Based on what I\\'ve read (I\\'ve never driven one), the Contour offered dynamics similar to the Fusion, which is a good thing if you actually ENJOY driving.I actually found the Contour to be more aggressive than the Fusion. The 95-97 SE V6 MTX had a default sport suspension that was, well, sporty. Doing dumb things (lifting in a turn) brought the back end around, but using good form (trail braking, etc) got the car to rotate perfectly. It proved to be a great companion for HPDEs and autocrosses as well as a daily driver. The Fusion, relative to the Contour, is similar to the 90-93 Accord vs the current Accord design. A bit bigger, a bit more bloated, a bit more sluggish and a bit more bland. Also the Fusion handles more like a Japanese car while the Contour felt more like a European car.As long as I am chiming in, I also think the 90-93 Accord was a high point for Honda, and I think the next generation (94-96 or 7?) was the low point. I can definitely see Saturn L300 in the front end of the spy shots for \\'08, and 5-series in the huge flanks. Not a bad thing necessarily, just noted.  i probably should have said the 2006 model, and not the new one that just came out :P-thene  Try $750 for sedans and $1,000 for coupes last year. Not the thousands of dollars you claim. I\\'m pretty darn sure I\\'m not mistaken on this, but would love a link proving me otherwise.I can\\'t provide you with a link because Edmunds does not keep a history. It may have been for 2005 models that were left over but I know it was that high because we were considering getting one for a short time. Take a look at current dealer cash for 2006 Acuras if you don\\'t believe Honda would offer so much cash off on their vehicles.Starting at post 7580 in the now \"read only\" \"Has Honda\\'s Run - run out?\" thread you\\'ll find discussion about it too.That\\'s about all I can give you right now.  I factory ordered a Mazda 6i hatch limited from the factory ( as there was not one grand touring with a manual transmission in the entire state of CA). Someone on the Mazda Board said it would take about 6 weeks for delivery, which is in line with what the dealer said. My question is, when the car arrives, how long of a test drive should I take before signing the paperwork? How much testing does the dealer do to make sure the factory has delivered a car free of mechanical issues?  I feel sorry for those folks that ran out and bought a 6 let\\'s say at \\'invoice\\' only to find the same car available several months later for 3 or 4 grand cheaper... Actually the 2007 Mazda6 has had the same $2000 rebate since about November, so few would have sold for much more than invoice minus that $2000. Prices seem to have gone as much as $1500 to $2500 lower...but I don\\'t think everyone is getting a price this low. So I think there is a much smaller differential than 3-4 grand...more like a $2000ish range for most. Just a few posts back Accords were found to be going for discounts of $3500 or even more...which is $1500 or more below invoice. Why is this not also an issue for the Accord buyer? Surely some had paid invoice or perhaps even $500 above invoice 6 months ago.  And captain... what is your source for saying a 20k accord costs 11k to manufacture no source in particular, just my understanding of the manufacturing business in general dating all the way back to B-school back a long time ago. If anything, it would actually surprise me if that $11k wasn\\'t high. These are not likely numbers that the mfgrs. are ever going to want public. If Honda can build the Accord in Ohio cheaper than Ford can build a Fusion in Mexico, which may be the case - Honda sure as heck wouldn\\'t want us to know that (or vice versa) , don\\'t you think? Remember that I\\'m talking only about direct mfg. cost and nothing more.As for \\'pretty sad\\' I agree.  Why is this not also an issue for the Accord buyer?It should be, but also something that usually happens with any model from any manufacturer before a redesign. Just think what must be happening with 07 Malibu prices right now, as the 08 Aura clone has already beeen announced.  At no point in 2006 (or 2005) for that matter, has there been an cash incetive of $3000-4000 on any Accord. Let\\'s not get Acura in the picture, the RL has always been a slow seller and had even bigger rebates than present.  At no point in 2006 (or 2005) for that matter, has there been an cash incetive of $3000-4000 on any Accord.I say there was. It could have only been for certain markets as I did see it on Edmunds\\' own incentive page. That thread I linked referred to the cash as well. I am offering you some form of proof, weak as it may be, and all you can say back is that it didn\\'t happen? Thanks for your insight but I know what I saw. :P  That thread I linked referred to the cash as well. gotta go with accordman on this one - what I saw listed for Hondas had to do with the Ridgeline truck and the S2000 only and weren\\'t rebates at all - instead mfgr. to dealer incentives. What Honda has to do to sell Acuras OTH has very little relevance to Accords, there is a whole lot more profit in the upper tier brands. In any case, it should be noted however, that it is possible to buy an Accord for some number slightly below invoice, an unusual occurence to be sure and something that will not likely be possible when the 08s get here.  These are not likely numbers that the mfgrs. are ever going to want public. If Honda can build the Accord in Ohio cheaper than Ford can build a Fusion in Mexico, which may be the case - Honda sure as heck wouldn\\'t want us to know that (or vice versa) , don\\'t you think? Remember that I\\'m talking only about direct mfg. cost and nothing more. Considering these companies are publicly traded and are required by GAAP and the SEC to report their operations in a specific fashion, I think its safe to say an informed bean counter could easily tell you, within an acceptable tolerance of a few bucks, what the COGS of each unit is. Why do you think that # is secret?  I\\'d be willing to believe $4,000 below sticker. Accords are selling for that today, at my local Honda dealer (and yours too, probably).$4,000 below invoice would put an Accord EX V6 at something like $21,000, or below the sticker of an Accord with drum brakes and hubcaps. You may have seen what you say you saw (you see?  sorry for the alliteration) but I can\\'t honestly wrap my mind around an Accord for about $12,000, which is what a Value Package Accord would be with $4,000 below invoice. That would be cheaper than the Fit without cruise control, and $3,000 below the price of a Civic without a radio or A/C. I really think you believe what you are saying, but with all due respect, I don\\'t believe at any point in the last 10 years you could buy an Accord for $12,000/$4,000 under invoice.  I just may encourage her to consider a new mazda6 rather than spending $4-5K on a junk-mobile...$14K for a nice new car like the Mazda6 SVE is a fantastic bargain, IMO. I really agree with your logic. $4,000 would buy a high-mileage 10 year old Honda (that\\'s a lot of money for a car with 150,000 miles). My car is worth $3,600 or so \"According\"  to Kelley Blue Book (1996 Accord LX Auto, 4-cyl, 173,000 miles). This week, the radiator went out, something that cost more than $500. These types of repairs/replacements are bound to happen on cars of this age/mileage, so buying a reliable $14k car is probably at least as financially sound as buying a $4,000 car that will need some repairs sooner than later.  Well look at the math. Let\\'s say it costs 11k per accord and the median profit per car is 7k. Let\\'s use 300k Accords sold in the US per year, that\\'s 2.1 billion in profit. Assume they broke even on the other 700k cars sold in the US (which I highly doubt), yet that 2.1 billion is 3 times greater than their posted global profit of 609 million last year. Hmmmm....  Sounds about right to me. Of course, shipping(they eat a chunk of it to keep their shipping in line with the domestics) and prep and such eats into it, and the warranty coverage and so on, so figure $11K on that VP plus 3-4K in overhead. I\\'ve seen the VP going for $15K at the end of the year, so that\\'s probably their real bottom line(and trust me - a VP - the guys will take ANY offer on it since it\\'s a lot anchor in most major cities.Oh - and ~30% of the VPs are made in Japan. If you can get one made there instead of the U.S., it\\'s a slightly better car in terms of fit and finish. Or go U.S. - it\\'s a nice car if you get it in a dark color so the non-body colored accents don\\'t immediately make it obvious.Oh - one last thing - the steel wheels on the Civic and Accords weigh exactly the same as the alloys. You\\'re paying purely for bling with factory alloys, so if you want to really save weight, go aftermarket.  \" I really liked driving the Fusion and seats were comfortable, but did not care for the appearance...\"I agree, the Fusion is either a like or dislike for its styling. Isn\\'t it nice to have choice?   Isn\\'t it nice to have choice?There were plenty of choices to consumers before the Fusion came along. I chose a Taurus once and that turned into a costly mistake. Now I choose to buy Hondas.  gotta go with accordman on this one - what I saw listed for Hondas had to do with the Ridgeline truck and the S2000 only and weren\\'t rebates at all - instead mfgr. to dealer incentives. If you go back and read the older posts you\\'ll note that I did say the $3000-$4000 I saw for the Accord last year was \"marketing support\" or \"dealer cash\". Again, it could have been a regional thing so maybe a lot of you didn\\'t see it. I did not look at other zips across the country to see if it was a National thing either. I was shopping for a car last summer and did see it. I was only looking at a V6 too so that may play into it somewhat but I don\\'t think they change the amount based on the trim level.I\\'m only seeing $750 in dealer cash right now but the summer has just begun.In my experience when you see vehicles selling for thousands less than the sticker price then the mfr is kicking some money into the dealer pot in some way. Especially for a Honda. We\\'ve only owned one but I\\'ve dealt with Honda salesmen on 3 different occasions. Getting them to budge on price is no minor feat. YMMV.  well it may be 2.1 billion of profit if you only consider manufacturing cost. There is much much more cost associated with running any sort of business - including administration (the suits), paying their utility bills, taxes, health care/pension programs etc. etc. etc. Does it take a great big chunk out of your 2.1 billion, sure seems to doesn\\'t it? Hmmmmm, but understand what I was talking about, the actual direct cost of manufacturing (materials and labor) an automobile (this being an estimate) - NOT the total cost including any overhead. This all in response to a poster that seems to think that there is so much NET profit in an automobile that a \\'good deal\\' can\\'t be had unless some manufacturer is dropping his drawers with some outrageous rebate and/or financing programs. These kind of expectations are really a \\'Detroit\\' car phenomena and will continue to haunt those mfgrs for years to come (when you shop the Camcord, for example, you expect to negotiate from MSRP, do the same thing with a Fusibu then you expect (and generally receive) discounts to some number well below invoice. And then they wonder why they continue to lose their arss in the car business and further have suspect resale values! Give me a break - but it does lend some truth to the adages that \\'you get what you (are willing) to pay for\\' and \\'cheap ain\\'t (necessarily) good\\'.  what is current on the Accord, I believe is $0 rebate and $0 ($750 if this is correct is rather inconsequential on a $20k car, don\\'t you think?) dealer incentive but a slightly bought down interest rate (3% and 5%) or so \\'to highly qualified buyers.\\' One wonders how \\'qualified\\' those buyers must be and/or how much down is required, but it sure does avoid those loose credit issues that afflicted both Ford and Mitsubishi not too long ago when they decided to sell cars to anybody that had a pulse.  The $750 is what you know about, if they are selling for $1500 below invoice there is likely more that we do not know about.  I agree with what you say from a good accountant\\'s perspective, cost of materials are generally an easy number to glean off a financial statement, labor costs (and the assocaited costs that go with that) a little tougher to segregate which of those costs were actually incurred directly from production. What is acutally contained in COGS (cost of goods sold) is somewhat variable within established accounting principles and techiques. However, I think the general reaction to Honda if they do only spend 11k (and I think it may easily be somewhat less than that) making a car that they sell for 20k, will be more like zzzom6\\'s - they somehow think they are getting ripped off something that is not the case at all. Not good PR for Honda or any manfacturer for the public to understand the economics of a durable goods manufacturing operation IMO.  There were plenty of choices to consumers before the Fusion came along. I chose a Taurus once and that turned into a costly mistake. Now I choose to buy Hondas. Of course, the point is that is is nice to have some alternate body styles to choose from. Ford, GM, and Chysler do this without necessarily having to pay a premium price. For example, if one does not like the Fusion, perhaps they find the Milan appealing.Honda and Toyota only let you do so if you pay up for Acura or Lexus. With the volume of Accords and Camrys they sell, they could certainly choose to offer the customer more choices in the mid-size moderately priced category.  jeff- now that\\'s a \\'bunker mentality\\' if I ever heard one! New auto sales are \\'losers\\' for about every dealersip known to mankind - they make their money in the service and used car depts. Had a good friend that had existing Toyota and Nissan dealerships, was really looking forward to opening his new Ford franchise next door and it had nothing to do with making money \\'selling\\' new Fords...  :confuse:  I chose a Taurus once and that turned into a costly mistake. Now I choose to buy Hondas.An interesting quote. We must be outside of the norm because neither my wife or I have ever owned a Honda or a Toyota. We have, however, owned two Mazdas, a new 1977 GLC (puddle jumper) bought new and a 2000 Miata convertible bought new. Both were fine cars but we bought a 2007 SEL AWD Fusion this time, $27,105 MSRP.That decision was based on several factors. We really liked the styling, inside and out. We have generally had good luck with Ford products. The professional reviews of the Fusion have been good. We considered the Accord and Camry to be out of our price range. The Asian cars also strike us as having \"plain Jane\" styling. There is a certain \"sameness\" to them all.But what I am curious about goes to the quote. Your bad experience with a Taurus drove you to Honda. While Honda and Toyota build some fine cars -- that is a given -- it is still possible to get one that is troublesome.Would a bad experience with a Honda drive you (or anyone) toward something from the \"Big 3\" or would you (they) still stick with Honda? How deep does brand loyalty go?We own two other Fords, a 1997 Thunderbird with 86,000 miles on it and a 2000 Focus station wagon with 92,000 miles on it. Neither has been trouble free but neither has had a major problem either (knock on wood).It will be interesting to see if our Fusion lives up to its reliability billing and/or equals our other two Ford products in that area. Right now, according to published reports, the Fusion is earning a high \"conquest\" rating. Buyers are trading in makes other than Fords at a significant rate.These \"converts\" tell me that Ford is doing something right with the Fusion. I hope it continues. If the Fusion continues to equal or better the reliability rating of Accord and Camry we will be happy campers.  I just may encourage her to consider a new mazda6 rather than spending $4-5K on a junk-mobile...$14K for a nice new car like the Mazda6 SVE is a fantastic bargain, IMO.I think basic reliable recent used car transportation is about 7-8k unless you are handy. 7-8k will be a couple year old Focus or Protege or a \"rolla with some miles. I think starting out in life with no car payment helps a lot. If you are handy and can take hand-me-downs and/or can cherry-pick craigslist bottom feeders, your maintenance costs are like a small car payment.This week, the radiator went out, something that cost more than $500. These types of repairs/replacements are bound to happen on cars of this age/mileage, so buying a reliable $14k car is probably at least as financially sound as buying a $4,000 car that will need some repairs sooner than later.Wow, I haven\\'t found a radiator that costs more than $100. I am used to looking for them because thats an 7-8 year Accord/Civic item. Installs pretty easily, it takes about 30 minutes in a stick without AC, about 2x that with AC.  \"I say there was. It could have only been for certain markets as I did see it on Edmunds\\' own incentive page. That thread I linked referred to the cash as well. \"I am offering you some form of proof, weak as it may be, and all you can say back is that it didn\\'t happen? Thanks for your insight but I know what I saw.\"No sir, there was never any kind of rebate, be it manufacturer to dealer or whatever, to the tune of 3-4k for Accords, anywhere in the US. If you have any proof of it being there, please post it.  I think basic reliable recent used car transportation is about 7-8k...I think starting out in life with no car payment helps a lot. Yes, but 7-8K or even 3-5 is not going to equal no car payment for many (such as my daughter) just starting out. She did get a one time freebie, but she has pretty well worn it out. Partly this is because she drove more than I had expected she would, it was at about 100K when she got it and I had anticipated it would be at maybe 120K by the time she was done with college and would still have maybe a year or two of life left in it. I\\'m really not sure how she managed to get 10K miles per year on it.By coicidence, the one expensive repair she had was also a $500 radiator at Ford dealer. She happened to be out of town when it happened so we had her get a tow to nearest Ford dealer...not knowing where else to go, plus I was figuring the car had overheated and was going to be dead anyway. Later, I found out this would have been maybe a $300 job at a radiator shop.   No sir, there was never any kind of rebate, be it manufacturer to dealer or whatever, to the tune of 3-4k for Accords, anywhere in the US. If you have any proof of it being there, please post it.I already said I can\\'t prove it because it is now gone. If you don\\'t want to believe me or prove me wrong otherwise then I suggest this be dropped because all it is now is a he said he said ordeal which is boring.  what is current on the Accord, I believe is $0 rebate and $0 ($750 if this is correct is rather inconsequential on a $20k car, don\\'t you think?) dealer incentive but a slightly bought down interest rate (3% and 5%) or so \\'to highly qualified buyers.That\\'s your region. Now look at my region.Did I say $750 was something to get excited about somewhere? Because I don\\'t recall typing that and I really don\\'t think it is. The $3000 I saw last year was and almost convinced me to buy an Accord.Why are you guys having such a hard time with this? Honda does offer some high incentives at times. They don\\'t seem to last long and they certainly are not the same as the piles of cash on the hood the domestics offer, but they are significant if you catch them at the right time.  Well, I don\\'t think anyone can prove something does not, or did not, exist, but I do agree that it\\'s time this be dropped.   it seems like automakers in general have taken to minimizing the carpeting in their vehiclesI love my Altima 3.5 SE--but I could swear my 1990 Ford Festiva LX has what would be a more expensive grade of carpet than the Altima...  I love my Altima 3.5 SE--but I could swear my 1990 Ford Festiva LX has what would be a more expensive grade of carpet than the Altima...The carpeting in our MSRP $27,105 2007 SEL AWD Fusion is not as good as what\\'s in our 2000 Focus station wagon. The Fusion\\'s rug is mighty flimsy, a disappointment.  Still, a good used car is always going to make more sense financially than a new one.So you had a $300 repair. That\\'s not even one month\\'s payment on most economy cars! I hear peolpe saying \"My transmission went out - it was $1600 to fix(old GM or Ford)\" - well, that\\'s 4 months of car payments, give or take.Payments add up fast and few old cars ever need even more than a thousand a year in the worst case to keep running.JeffyScott: If she needs another car, look at a 5-6 year old Buick LeSabre. Big tank that she can get for cheap and will easily last upwards of 200K miles. Cheap to fix and maintain as well, plus dirt cheap insurance rates.  That\\'s your region. Now look at my region. I\\'m confused, I just see 2.9-4.9% and $750 dealer incentive there. Plus the $750 says \"Eligible vehicles sold utilizing this incentive program do not qualify for: 2007 Accord 4-cyl Sedan Special AHFC Lease/Purchase Plan\"...not sure what that means, maybe that they don\\'t get the $750, if you get the 2.9-4.9%???I don\\'t think you will have any luck but there is this source for old web pages: http://www.archive.org/web/web.php  So you had a $300 repair. That\\'s not even one month\\'s payment on most economy cars! Payments add up fast and few old cars ever need even more than a thousand a year in the worst case to keep running.On July 5, 2004, I bought a 1990 Ford Festiva 5 spd with 159,000 miles on it for $300--tho\\'t I\\'d be lucky to get the thing home. It\\'s coming up on 181,000--replaced clutch and timing belt at 175,000 for $750, just put in new radiator for $250. Everytime I fill up, it\\'s 39-41 MPG. I use it around town and let the new Altima sit most of the time--I\\'m shooting for 200,000...  Well look at the math. Let\\'s say it costs 11k per accord and the median profit per car is 7k. Let\\'s use 300k Accords sold in the US per year, that\\'s 2.1 billion in profit. Assume they broke even on the other 700k cars sold in the US (which I highly doubt), yet that 2.1 billion is 3 times greater than their posted global profit of 609 million last year. Hmmmm.... Your numbers are waaaay off. the 609 is correct (or close to it) but thats 609 billion, and thats in YEN. Honda makes about 2 billion a quarter in profit. their yearly profit is somewhere between 5 and 6 billion.  Of course, the point is that is is nice to have some alternate body styles to choose from. Ford, GM, and Chysler do this without necessarily having to pay a premium price. For example, if one does not like the Fusion, perhaps they find the Milan appealing. Honda and Toyota only let you do so if you pay up for Acura or Lexus. With the volume of Accords and Camrys they sell, they could certainly choose to offer the customer more choices in the mid-size moderately priced category.There are two ways of looking at this. What if GM took the best people they had designing the Aura, the best from the G6, and the best from the Malibu design teams, and put them together, to design 1 great car. Many times, these cars are stealing sales from each other. I think they should consolidate these resources. I\\'m sure the one team that designed the Accord was more cost effective than three teams designing the Aura, G6, and Malibu. The point is, the Aura, G6, and Malibu are basicly part of the same market segment. At least the Accord, and TL are going at two separate segments, and not taking sales away from each other.  Still, a good used car is always going to make more sense financially than a new one.Yea but you don\\'t always know what \"a good used car\" is. Unless you know the car\\'s history you have to just hope and pray you\\'re buying a good car.I\\'d rather buy a basic new car, with a clean history and a new warranty, than a mystery used car. That\\'s one of the reasons Hyundai is kickin\\' butt.  Re. your 1990 Ford Festiva . . . I\\'m sure you know who manufactured it - Kia. So much for unreliable South Korean cars . . .  \"There were plenty of choices to consumers before the Fusion came along. I chose a Taurus once and that turned into a costly mistake. Now I choose to buy Hondas\"Thats funny, same thing happened to me! I chose a Honda Accord in 2000. After my problems, I figured out its all hype, and they are way overrated and overpriced. So I went back to Ford..   \"We\\'ve only owned one but I\\'ve dealt with Honda salesmen on 3 different occasions. Getting them to budge on price is no minor feat. YMMV.\"As I have been trying to tell somone here! Honda dealers Don\\'t deal! I have personal experience with this myself. As far as resale [email\\xa0protected] Trying to trade my 2000 Accord was not a great experience. One dealer told me, I\\'ll never forget this one.. \" Accord LX\\'s are all over the place, I have 6 of them on my lot now\"... :surprise:  Fact is, some people will complain about anything. I read one review where the owner complained that his Accord\\'s door would not stay open, if he parked on an incline. Wonder what he would have thought about my last rental (Chevy) that the door was almost impossible to close. If you closed it too hard it would bounce back out, if you didn\\'t close it hard enough, it simply would not close. You should not have to concentrate on how hard to close a door. This was by far not the only Chevy I\\'ve driven with this problem.:sick:  I just test drove a Camry and Saturn this afternoon. I was convinced I wanted a Camry but after test driving the Saturn, I really like it (the Saturn). V6 is standard, as are many other features not on Camry. Am I missing something or is the Saturn as good as I think it is compared to Toyota? Camry had a lot of bad reviews here. That surprised me because everyone I talked to who has a Camry loves it.Camry seems to have better gas mileage.  \"Camry had a lot of bad reviews here\"Some of the stuff in here is noise. You have to like the car you buy be it domestic or foreign and hope you get a vehicle off the assembly line that will give you a great ownership experience.  Am I missing something or is the Saturn as good as I think it is compared to Toyota?I too checked out the Saturn (I assume you mean the Aura) a few months back. Seems like a good car that would go the distance and satisfy you. However you have to wait for 75,000 miles to hit the odometer to find out if your assumption was correct whereas you can pretty much bank on the Camry (or Accord) doing that.  just a suggestion depending on what value you put on engine/drivetrain refinement - stick with the XR variant with the 3.6 in it - but drive it first and make sure that you accelerate it hard coming out of a corner on a test drive. Do yourself a favor, though, and test the new Altima as well. The Aura impressed me as well, and certainly may be \\'Detroit\\'s\\' best effort to date. Or you can wait for the 08 Malibu to get onto the lots, same car slightly different styling cues. The Camry V6, IMO, is easily the best V6 out there right now, likely will get you better FE and may not actually cost any more to own than a Saturn or Malibu. The longer you plan to keep the car, the cheaper things like the Saturn/Malibu become. I would be curious what sort of prices you are being quoted on both cars?  I\\'m confused, I just see 2.9-4.9% and $750 dealer incentive there.I know we agreed to drop this but I didn\\'t want to leave someone confused. It was said that there were currently no cash incentives on the Accord, only low interest rates. You saw how there is a cash incentive in my area right now which I\\'m guessing will only increase as the year goes on. Follow now? Plus the $750 says \"Eligible vehicles sold utilizing this incentive program do not qualify for: 2007 Accord 4-cyl Sedan Special AHFC Lease/Purchase Plan\"...not sure what that means, maybe that they don\\'t get the $750, if you get the 2.9-4.9%???They have a low interest rate and special lease program running on certain trim levels of the Accord too. You have to finance through AHFC and, as I understand it, cannot combine the $750 with either of those deals at this time.I don\\'t think you will have any luck but there is this source for old web pages: http://www.archive.org/web/web.php Cool link! But no luck. They are missing a lot of the 2006 pages and when you click on the \"check incentives link\" from the Edmunds home page it takes you to the current incentives.  The variation from zip code could be in hundreds, not in thousands of dollars, as your post seems to imply. You are just confusing people with rumors.Again, at no point in the last couple of years have incentives etc been in the 3-4k dollar range on the Accord.  It was said that there were currently no cash incentives on the Accord, only low interest rates. You saw how there is a cash incentive in my area right now which I\\'m guessing will only increase as the year goes on. Follow now? Yep...thanks for explaining.  There are two ways of looking at this...Yes, that is true and you make some valid points about the potential greater efficiency and profitablity of having only one version of a car.  On the Camry LE 4 cylinder I\\'m being quoted deal invoice of $19,811 plus sales tax and license. On the Saturn Aura V6 I\\'m being quoted $20595 plus $650 delivery, sales tax and license. Saturn is offering $1750 cash back for a cash deal or 1.9% fiancing for 36 months.  the Aura obviously the XE with the 3.5 pushrod?  You may want to read this comparo.

Of course I would like to have seen a Fusion thrown into the mix, but was not surprised that the Accord finished first.  to quote the \"caveman\" from Geico : \"? HUH ?\" Reference those down the left hand part of the messages.  was not surprised that the Accord finished first.Not many are.They should do the same test of these cars with 60,000 miles on them. I\\'m sure the Accord would stay atop the pack and probably widen its lead. That\\'s the allure of the Accord. The Aura,the Optima and the Fusion are question marks until then.  was not surprised that the Accord finished first.Not many are.They should do the same test of these cars with 60,000 miles on them. I\\'m sure the Accord would stay atop the pack and probably widen its lead. That\\'s the allure of the Accord. The Aura,the Optima and the Fusion are question marks until then.Interesting idea, GoodEgg. I guess the closest thing to the 60,000 miles evaluation is Consumer Reports reliability findings. The book on the Fusion is still out, of course, but the preliminary feedback on the 2006 model has been pretty good.I was really interested in the Accord but the wife wasn\\'t, so you know how that goes. Plus we considered the Accord to be out of our price range when equipped like our 2007 AWD SEL Fusion, MSRP $27,105.The other factors were the Fusion\\'s bold styling and excellent handling abilities. We didn\\'t even pursue, test drive or price the Accord but probably should have, in retrospect.Actually, I like the looks of the 2007 Accord better than I do spy the photos I\\'ve seen of the 2008 Accord.My only serious complaint about the V6 AWD Fusion is its very poor in-city gas mileage, 14.8 mpg and holding at 3,200 miles. It does deliver 24 mpg in highway driving though. Unfortunately, 95 percent of our driving is in the city, stop and go, short hops. Perhaps a V6 Accord wouldn\\'t do any better. We should have bought an I4 to begin with given that gasoline is at $3 a gallon and headed for $4.So far, the Fusion has been absolutely trouble free for the first six months with nary a single rattle, squeak or flaw to be found. The fit and finish on all of its collective parts are perfect. It\\'s an exceptional automobile -- for us at least.  I\\'m in the market for a sporty 4door w/ manual transmission; today i went to the [subaru] dealer and sat in the legacy for the first time. I was pretty shocked to find how cramped the rear quarters were ... And the sad part is im not even a big person. 6\\'-0\" @ 190lb, i\\'d consider myself averaged size and I could barely fit in the rear seat. I can get comfortable in the drivers seat ... i just have to put the seat all the way back and recline the seat-back a bit. When i did that, I dont see how anyone could sit behind me. Also, there is some serious lack of headroom [in the back] too, that C-Pillar makes rear-quarters entry an acrobatic task.I wish car companies would make usable rear seats that aren\\'t penalty boxes. In comparison, I drive a \\'98 regal, and I can fit ok in the rear seat after I positioned the driver seat to my liking.Anybody got good recomendations for a sporty 4door with M/T? I hear the altima\\'s M/T isnt so great and I hate how everyone and their mother\\'s have that car ... too many out there.  Test drives are great! Try the Mazda speed also! sporty 4 doors with manual transmissions, wow, this is a tough one. My guess is your going to have to go to a Euro of some sort, Audi A3? Passat maybe? Saab?  The house is short but there is a Legacy in the stable already. I am personally jonesin for a MazdaSpeed6 but its looking like I am more likely to end up with an Accord VP...about as exciting as a box of rocks   What about an Accord SE 4-cyl - a little less boring and about $18,000 including destination for the stick shift. About as quick as the Mazda6s to boot. Throw on a large sway bar in the rear for a little better handling.The Mazda6 is a screaming value though with all the rebates, though the Accord VP really has all the guts of the higher priced models, and is no slouch itself.  Interesting - I have an AWD midsize with a 3.0 Liter 227HP Duratec derivative that delivers 19-20MPG in town and 27MPG on interstate runs. I suspect that your engine\\'s not broken in fully yet. It\\'s been my experience with 2 of these engines, that some blasts of hard acceleration up to redline is needed to fully break them in. They\\'re also sensitive to engine oil levels. If overfilled with oil, they deliver poor economy.REgards:OldCEM  What about an Accord SE 4-cyl - a little less boring and about $18,000 including destination for the stick shift. About as quick as the Mazda6s to boot. Throw on a large sway bar in the rear for a little better handling.Yeah, the issue its its another 2 grand for what basically amounts to alloy wheels (with \"OEM\" level tires) and a fancier stereo. The only things I really like in the SE are rear discs.At 16k the Accord VP is an excellent value, at 18k for basically the same car, you are getting pretty close to a Mazda V6/stick in terms of TMV.  Sporty 4 door with manual... I suggest something a few years old - mainly because for the price of a basic small car, you can easily get something decent and useable.A few year old CTS comes to mind, for instance, as do the previous generation Saabs, and of course the Volvo S60. The rear seats are decently sized AND they are considerably nicer handling than any of the budget boxes. Plus, they often come with all the goodies of a upper-end vehicle.  Sporty 4-door with manual?Easy. Mazda 6.Whether it\\'s the 6i (with 4-cyl), 6s (with V6), or the MazdaSpeed6 (with turbo 4-cyl), you can\\'t get any sportier for the price. Any model could be had for well under invoice. You can even get a 6i or 6s 5-door if you need a little more cargo flexibility.  At 16k the Accord VP is an excellent value, at 18k for basically the same car, you are getting pretty close to a Mazda V6/stick in terms of TMV. According to Edmunds for the Accord the LX trim adds power mirrors, an upgraded audio system and a few extra interior features. The SE is similar to the LX but has 16-inch alloy wheels (17s for V6-equipped SE models), rear disc brakes, a six-disc in-dash CD changer and steering wheel-mounted audio controls.The Accord SE is pretty comparable to the Mazda6 SVE in equipment level. However the Mazda6 SVE can likely be bought for $1000-2000 less than even the Accord VP, based on the $16k figure being given for the manual transmission Accord VP.  I\\'m in the market for a sporty 4door w/ manual transmission;I\\'m curious to know why you want a manual transmission in a sedan? Seems like a chore to me. Also you\\'ll be penalized at resale. A manual in a coupe I understand.  I\\'m curious to know why you want a manual transmission in a sedan? Seems like a chore to me. Also you\\'ll be penalized at resale.A manual in a coupe I understand.If I may chime in here, I don\\'t think a manual in a sedan is that odd of a combination. If he isn\\'t driving in much traffic, a manual is a great choice, IMHO. It adds a level of excitement to a relatively \"boring\" class of cars. My next car will be a manual sedan, as is my current vehicle, as I will need 4 doors for the family but enjoy shifting as well. My commute is 95% highway with no traffic, so obviously I have a different opinion than one who sits in rush hour traffic. As far as resale, I personally am of the opinion that those who purchase cars with manual transmissions, especially midsize sedans, tend to drive their cars to the point where resale value is really a moot point. I feel that those who purchase manuals have more involved/emotional attachments to their cars.  Some people just like to shift themselves. I\\'m one of them, but we are few and far between.One of the main reasons for getting a stick in the past, slightly better gas mileage, is pretty much moot now. With auto trannies having 5, 6, or even 7 gears now fuel mileage differences are almost gone and in some cases have swung the other way around. I for one love driving a stick in anything but a truck. The extra control in the snow is another reason for my choice.  I\\'m curious to know why you want a manual transmission in a sedan? Seems like a chore to me.It\\'s no chore to an enthusiast, especially since a manual offers better control, especially when driving aggressively through corners, and in the slippery stuff. For me, no manual = no sale.  Accords seem to outnumber Camrys in the Southeast. But there are a ton of Altimas too. Nissan has a strong reputation here because they build a great vehicle and price it a little less than Honda. Hyundai doesn\\'t seem to benefit from the same formula - at least in midsize sedans. I\\'m seeing more Santa Fes than Sonatas.  I agree with the positive manual comments. I love driving a manual in heavy traffic too.Just because someone needs four doors, doesn\\'t mean he or she doesn\\'t want the fun and reliability of a manual. The advantages for me are:- better overall mileage- lasts longer than an automatic (fewer repairs)- cheaper initial cost (automatics are usually a more expensive option)- more control- quicker and more responsive- waaaay more fun to driveAgain, these are advantages for ME. I realized that I\\'m in a minority, especially since many seem to have problems driving a manual in heavy traffic... I find it to be a distinct advantage. And the Accord manual is sooo smooth.   The point about resale value only holds if it is a basic car. A manual tansmission BMW, Mercedes, or even a Celica... They sell immediately and for more money.When a stickshift C class comes on the lot - the local dealership put an ad online and it\\'s gone in three days or less every time. There\\'s a very dedicated and small group that specifically seeks out these cars.Plus, yes, shifting is more fun, even in traffic. I can move a car with a good gearbox in and out of city traffic seconds quicker per \"move\" that I make if I want to. Automatics stink at the 10-20mph difference quick bursts that you need to zig and zag through traffic. By the time a typical torque converter unlocks itself and the thing decides to shift, I\\'m already in that spot.  I personally am of the opinion that those who purchase cars with manual transmissions, especially midsize sedans, tend to drive their cars to the point where resale value is really a moot point. I feel that those who purchase manuals have more involved/emotional attachments to their cars.A most interesting analogy, slegacy93. It is logical. I wonder if there are any surveys to support the theory?The last manual transmission car we owned was a 1977 Mazda GLC (Great Little Car) that lasted about 15 years without any drive train problems. We ended up giving the car away to a first-time driver.   AGREED.I just like having more control over the car and plus its alot of fun. You dont have to have a coupe to necessitate a manual. I drove a 5speed Wrangler once, that was sweet experience. I rarely encounter stop&go traffic so that won\\'t be an issue.What dissapoints me is that in the midwest chicagoland area, there are no leftover 07 GT\\'s. So I have to wait until the 08 production ramps up. From what the salesperson said, GT\\'s are prioritized last. Right now you can find lowlevel trim legacy\\'s.. next on the list is the new 3.0L model due like mid-late june. The other car I have in mind is the Mazdaspeed3. The MS6 is a porky/heavy looking car ... I dunno, I\\'ll check it out. I hear there are great deals on MS6\\'s since they arent selling well.  I personally am of the opinion that those who purchase cars with manual transmissions, especially midsize sedans, tend to drive their cars to the point where resale value is really a moot point. I feel that those who purchase manuals have more involved/emotional attachments to their cars.A most interesting analogy, slegacy93. It is logical. I wonder if there are any surveys to support the theory? I also would love to see a survey to support the point. Maybe someone on here has the interest or time?? I know it applies to me. We currently have 3 cars, the oldest being my, you guessed it, a 1993 Subaru Legacy. My wife keeps hounding me to get rid of it, but I am attached. Granted, it was my first car, but it also has a manual - something our other 2 cars do not. This is my #1 reason for not wanting to let it go.  Having shopped a used S60, there is nothing even remotely sporty about it. It is like driving a Sweedish Taurus.As far as a manual, that is why I am looking at the Accord, Mazda6, and how the Legacy wagon came to be.  I completely agree with tallman1. I have a Camry with a manual transmission!  One more for a 4 door manual. I had a two door Integra, but then kids came along - why should I deny myself the fun, speed, control, economy, low purchase price and durability of a manual just because I now need 4 doors.BTW the RX-8 is a 4 door.   \"BTW the RX-8 is a 4 door. \"But you can only fit 2.5 people into it comfortably.   Plus, yes, shifting is more fun, even in traffic. I can move a car with a good gearbox in and out of city traffic seconds quicker per \"move\" that I make if I want to. Automatics stink at the 10-20mph difference quick bursts that you need to zig and zag through traffic. By the time a typical torque converter unlocks itself and the thing decides to shift, I\\'m already in that spot.You obviously haven\\'t driven a good ManuMatic with a 235+ hp V6 (like the Sonata)to make those comments.  The RX8 can fit 4 people well enough. The requirement usually is two adults plus a couple of kids. And the S60R is a very nice car, used.(always get the performance version of course, of anything, used)  if we polled the aprticipants in this froum you will certainly find a disportionate amount of MT proponents. Why? because we are all car nuts and therfore more likely to appreciate and enjoy the control that almost any MT car gives us. Nationally, however, it is not even close -a samll percentage of 4 bangers get sold this way and an almost miniscule percentage of the V6s (some brands not even offered) sold this way. Higher gas prices may add a few more MT 4 bangers, but overall we Americans have become really lazy drivers - the Europeans just laugh at us...  That\\'s mostly because there are no manuals being *offered*. The number of people desiring a manual has hardly changed in the last 30 or 40 years. A good indication of this is the number of manu-matics that are everywhere. If the pent up demand for shifting manually wasn\\'t there, Porsche would have remained the only company doing it.I find it to be no problem in daily traffic - and I live in Los Angeles, birthplace of the freeway and traffic jam.For me, it\\'s mostly cost and reliability. If I need a new clutch, I can budget for one and squeeze it into my budget. If I need a rebuild on an automatic... I\\'ve had cars sit for as long as three months as I tried to scrape together the money.(read: take the bus, which in L.A. is not fun at all - or safe)But it\\'s also fun at times - traffic is okay - it is what it is. But when I get into the mountains, life is good.   You obviously haven\\'t driven a good ManuMatic with a 235+ hp V6 (like the Sonata)to make those comments.Actually I have, as well as a few tiptronic vehicles, and a paddle shift BWM and GTI DSG. It just wasn\\'t as fun for me as shifting. If that works for you, I think thats fantastic and when I\\'m old I might get a slushbox or CVT(although my father and father in law are both in their 60s and have 6 speed manuals), but for now, it has to have a pedal for a clutch if they want my business.  There was a post in the 2008 Sonata discussion from, apparently, a Hyundai sales rep, saying that the 2008 Sonata I4 will be available only with a stick shift, in GLS trim only. Meaning there will be no I4 + automatic choice on the Sonata.If that is true, what could HMA be thinking??  the Europeans just laugh at us... Why? Because we don\\'t like to shift gears? Who wants to deal with a clutch anyway? Ferrari seems to like paddle shifters themselves.I could care less what the Euros think about us anyway. Our lifestyle is vastly different, more affluent, more adventurous. Our vehicles reflect that.  That\\'s mostly because there are no manuals being *offered*. The number of people desiring a manual has hardly changed in the last 30 or 40 yearsI disagree. The market doesn\\'t work that way. car manufactures produce the products people want. That kind of stuff is heavily polled, surveyed, and focus group tested. The most likely culprit is traffic. For most people, working a clutch and stick in bumper to bumper traffic moving 10 mph is just a pain in the [non-permissible content removed].  I\\'d bet that for the europeans, mpg is the driving force in their preference for MT over autos. Ditto for their affinity to diesel cars. with 6-7 dollars or more for a gallon of gas, I guess every mpg you can squeeze out counts.  Honda\\'s apparent diesel offering in the new Accord could start a trend in the states for diesels. The Accord is so mainstream that its embracement of diesel vs. say VW\\'s is a big endorsement by a major player that may turn more and more heads toward the new generation of diesels.  Maybe, but diesel\\'s are a pain in the neck. I owned a golf diesel 10 years ago. They do last forever (mine was running perfect at 400k), and get tremendous millage (I was getting 60) but they can be a nightmare in the cold. below 20 degrees, diesel fuel turns into something resembling jello. You have to be careful to buy winterized diesel, or, or properly do it yourself. You also need to make sure your battery is in top shape, the same with the glow plugs. A gas car can start with a weak battery, a diesel won\\'t. In extreme cold (about 10 degrees or lower) you really need to plug it in at night. There\\'s issues with supply (most gas stations don\\'t have diesel pumps), more maintainance, and repairs are usually much more expensive. Just finding a good diesel mechanic can be a challenge. A diesel motor is also a good bit more expensive than a traditional gasoline engine. And, without a turbo charger, your going to notice a considerable loss of power. A lot more torque, but less horse power.  That was a very interesting read, Elroy5. Of course I would like to have seen a Fusion thrown into the mix, but was not surprised that the Accord finished first. and consumer reports put the altima 1st, and motor trends named the camry 2007 car of the year. rankings are really quite worthless. Not to knock ANY car, but you can find a review or ranking that says exactly what you want it to say, for any car you want.  rankings are really quite worthless. Not to knock ANY car, but you can find a review or ranking that says exactly what you want it to say, for any car you want. Not necessarily, name a (full) comparison that the Fusion, Malibu, and Sebring won (that they didn\\'t pay for themselves).  I owned a golf diesel 10 years ago.Wow, I wouldn\\'t expect any advances in technology over eh, a decade. Current VW TDIs don\\'t even have the diesel rattle, and additives to the fuel itself do a lot to make it more temperature stable. Diesel in my area is also ~$0.50/gal cheaper than gasoline, and diesel vehicles will travel considerably further on each gallon. I haven\\'t seen a gas station in SE MI without Diesel. Glow plugs have longer replacement intervals than spark plugs.I wouldn\\'t hesitate for a second if I could find a reliable manual transmissioned diesel sedan in my price range, and I would definitely do that before going for some half gas/half electric hodge podge that has only been around for a few years. Hopefully those battery packs are better than the one in my laptop, which uses the same technology.  name a (full) comparison that the Fusion, Malibu, and Sebring wonYea ...but the term \"won\" is misused.  Yea ...but the term \"won\" is misused. OK, let\\'s say \"ranked\" first, or even second.  Wow, I wouldn\\'t expect any advances in technology over eh, a decade. I\\'m not knocking diesel\\'s, they do have several advantages. but most of the technological improvements have been in the area of emmisions. But they are good cars. I bought the golf used for $300 with 300,000 miles on it, and kept it for 4 years. I gave it to my father in law, in perfect working order. And most of the time, it ran problem free. Its just when they do have problems, they\\'re 10x the headache than with a gas car. There are deffinitly drawbacks to them, and reasons why they\\'ve never caught on big in the states.  I disagree, it\\'s claustrophic back there. But to each there own.   Not necessarily, name a (full) comparison that the Fusion, Malibu, and Sebring won (that they didn\\'t pay for themselves). I\\'m sure they\\'re out there. The point is, all these reviewers have their own preferences, and it shows. Just look at C&D. They always name honda tops. the fit, civic, accord, CRV, it doesn\\'t matter. If its a honda, 9 out of 10 times they will rank it best. What did they say in that review? car of the universe? I mean, come on. be a little objective.And no, I have nothing against honda. own a civic and almost bought an accord. They\\'re great cars, worth the money, and deffinitly a top tier car. But I just have to take C&D with a grain of salt.  The trend has already been started. Mercedes is offering their Bluetec. BMW has had diesels ready to go in the states for a while. They are waiting for code uniformity dealing with pollution standards.  That\\'s easy. C/D ranked the Fusion 2nd in a comparo of the Accord, Fusion, Sonata, and (previous-gen) Camry. As for the Malibu, wasn\\'t it MT COTY in its previous incarnation? (Questionable, maybe, but it counts as a #1.) And with the new Malibu based on the same platform as the Aura, this year\\'s NACOTY, the Malibu could take home some accolades next year. As for the Sebring... it is such a great car, some company just got paid about $500M by DaimlerChrysler to take over ownership of it along with the rest of Chrysler. :P  That\\'s easy. C/D ranked the Fusion 2nd in a comparo of the Accord, Fusion, Sonata, and (previous-gen) Camry. I would like to see a link to that one. I thought the Fusion was 4th, out of 4 in that one.Questionable,  COTY is more than just questionable. They only consider \"new designs\" for car of the year. The Aura had no competition. The chances of the 08 Malibu winning COTY next year are 0%. It will have (stiff) competition.  The RX8 may be a bit claustrophobic, but well, you\\'re not the one sitting back there, are you?As for diesels, look, Europe gets cold winters - winters that make most of the U.S. look like a coldsnap. And their TDI/CDI vehicles do just fine. The new Honda diesel is, as Honda says, \"designed by a man who hates diesels\" - so it\\'s quiet and appliance-reliable. Also, diesel fuel takes less resources to refine and can be blended with, well, anything. You can in theory run a diesel engine on soybean oil, corn oil, or whatever - and most of them are far more renewable than petrochemical based fuels.(even a small amount helps)   The Aura had no competition.Actually yes, the Camry for one.  Its easy for the media to just go with the best sellers.. keeps the sales of their mags up!   Your right. Diesel made his engine to run off peanut oil. and you can buy (about $600) conversion kits to run any diesel off any vegetable oil. and its not that difficult. The only thing you need diesel fuel for is starting the vehicle.  Backseats, usable backseats. Isn\\'t that the point. The backseats in the RX-8 aren\\'t generally usable. Yes Mazda can claim it\\'s a 4 seater, but only 2 pint size individuals can be back there and not care.  The backseats in the RX-8 aren\\'t generally usable. That\\'s putting it mildly. The center console in the middle of the two seats is like a vise. A claustrophobic nightmare.Does the clamshell door style qualify a car for sedan status?  I wouldn\\'t hesitate for a second if I could find a reliable manual transmissioned diesel sedan in my price range, and I would definitely do that before going for some half gas/half electric hodge podge that has only been around for a few years. Hopefully those battery packs are better than the one in my laptop, which uses the same technology. Well said!Diesels have come a long way in only 5 years, let alone 10. A friend of the family owns a florist here in upstate NY, and has relied on VW Golf diesels for years. They both get about 30K miles per year, and will run 8-9 years until the body rusts out on them. They\\'re not loud, they don\\'t stink, and the glow plugs have to warm an extra second or two in below-zero weather, but they start right up. Not to mention the 40-50 MPG he gets regularly, which in $$$$ savings more than pays off for the diesel model price premium.Diesels can only get better, and I do hope Honda jumps in the diesel market. They\\'re well worth the supposed \"sacrifices\", and I\\'d take one over a hybrid any day.  I just got a used 2000 Mazda 626 w/ 118,000 miles. I\\'ve had it for 2 days and now it won\\'t go into reverse. It shifts fine when you\\'re driving but what would cause it to not go into reverse?  Does the clamshell door style qualify a car for sedan status? I don\\'t know, but the RX-8 is classified as a \"coupe\" by edmunds.   I just got a used 2000 Mazda 626 w/ 118,000 miles. I\\'ve had it for 2 days and now it won\\'t go into reverse. It shifts fine when you\\'re driving but what would cause it to not go into reverse?Sounds like a linkage problem. Why would you buy a car that had no reverse? Did reverse work when you bought it? I\\'d take it to a Mazda dealer.  Update: the original post in the 2008 Sonata discussion noting that the I4 would not be available with an automatic on the 2008 Sonata was in error. In fact, the I4 will be available on all trim lines for 2008. There are a few other tweaks to the Sonata as well, e.g. more standard equipment on the SE and Limited. Here are the details:wylldshark, \"2008 Hyundai Sonata\" #57, 26 May 2007 8:08 am  It is easy to find the link to the C/D comparo in which the Fusion took 2nd via google, but here\\'s the link for your convenience:http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/10245/mid-size-comparo.html  Second place is nice, in that comparo. Do you think it would beat out the 07 Camry though? I doubt it. I am surprised it beat out the V6 Sonata 06 Camry.  Since both the Optima and Aura beat out the 2007 Camry in C/D\\'s latest comparo of family sedans, I think there is an excellent chance that the Fusion would beat the new Camry if C/D did that comparo. The Camry finished next to last, only ahead of the woeful Sebring, in that comparo.  So I4s & V6s across the board. Nice!!  I\\'d agree that the Fusion would probably beat the 07 Camry in a comparison test if the vehicles are I4 models, but I wouldn\\'t be so sure of it if the Fusion V6 was compared against a Camry V6 today. I think the ratings would change a bit. I could be wrong but I doubt it. Other than subjective styling differences, lower prcing and handling, the Camry V6 (especially XLE and SE models) offer more in the way of standard equipment and safety features than the Fusion does.  Second place is nice, in that comparo. Do you think it would beat out the 07 Camry though? I doubt it. I am surprised it beat out the V6 Sonata 06 Camry. I don\\'t know why. These car magazines place more emphasis on the actual \"drive\" than anything else, and the Fusion trounces the last gen Camry and current Sonata in that regard.  Yes, if C/D compared the Camry SE V6 to the Fusion V6, the Camry might take it. The old Camry V6 was only six points (I think) behind the Fusion in the tests of \\'06 models. However, C/D just doesn\\'t seem very enamored with the \\'07 Camry. For example, in their comparo of basic I4 models, they noted how the Optima out-Toyota\\'d the Camry, or words to that effect.  The Fusion must \"drive\" very well. And it sounds like the Camry didn\\'t improve in that area since 06.  yes reverse worked when I got it. I drove it for 2 days and now it won\\'t shift into reverse. I drained the transmission fluid and it was black with a red tint so I\\'m wondering if the filter is clogged. Everywhere I call says I need to take it to a dealership but I don\\'t want to pay someone else for labor. I can do it myself if some knows what I should do and can tell me how to do it.  Maybe you would have better luck posting this in a 626 problem thread. Here\\'s the link.http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/WebX/.ee9965a/0  This time I went to the Mazda dealer to check out the MS6. I sat inside and i was impressed. Fit and finish are really nice. I didnt take a test drive, but I plan on it. I heard alot of comments about how the shifter is no good, but when i was rowing through the gears the gates were very well defined and extremely easy to find w/ short throws, i dont know what will change when I actually drive it. However, the clutch is VERY stiff ... Not sure if i could live w/ that. One problem i do have [not with this vehicle] is finding reverse on a 6speed transmissions [either left-up or down-right]. I can get can get the forward gears easy of course, but it seems like the shifter wont move farther left[MS6 has reverse up and to left]. Do I need to have the car running and/or have my foot on the brake and ONLY THEN will reverse open up? Only manuals i have driven are when reverse is behind 5th gear [5speeds]. If someone could enlighten me, i would be extremely grateful.I did the rear seat check and it passed w/ flying colors, a 6\\'-0\" individual can easily sit behind a driver of equal or less height.Hopefully there are no glarring errors or hidden problems w/ this car. Ive read about the computer fix that reduces the cars power or something, not sure. Hopefully it isnt major. I am also unsure of Mazda\\'s reliability but im sure its probably solid since its an asian manufacturer. Overall its one of those cars that is under the radar. Does anyone have any real-world 0-60 or 0-100 times? As in, w/o doing a insane 4000rpm clutch dump. Those advertised times are nice, but can only be achieved when one abuses the clutch.  I am also unsure of Mazda\\'s reliability Shoot - any turbo-ed 4 cyl. isn\\'t gonna deliver the reliability and major miles the naturally aspirated engines will. Get the turbo for the short-term, high revving lifestyle, but I\\'d get the latest V6s for speed and reliability without the huge rpm atmosphere of the turbo and questionable long term performance.  I have driven this car a few times, it is my \"stretch target.\" Alas my price range relegates me to the more mundane boring stuff but I loved the shifter, I thought it was very precise. I recall to get reverse you push down on the shifter while moving up and to the left ala VW. The Contour had a collar you would pull up when shifting into reverse, but the MS6 isn\\'t an MTX75 trans.Mazda has had some issues with reliability in certain models (the 626 4 cyl w/auto, early RX8, prev gen RX7 - which use rotary engines, not like the regular inline 4s) but has a pretty stellar reputation overall (Miatas last forever, etc).I really wouldn\\'t be too worried about a turbo motor. Mazda, Mitsubishi, Saab, Volvo and Honda all have turbo motors that are well proven and the motors seem to have excellent longevity, especially in stock form.The nice thing about turbos is they offer excellent efficiency while below boost.  Shoot - any turbo-ed 4 cyl. isn\\'t gonna deliver the reliability and major miles the naturally aspirated engines will. Get the turbo for the short-term, high revving lifestyle, but I\\'d get the latest V6s for speed and reliability without the huge rpm atmosphere of the turbo and questionable long term performance.20 years of turbo performance and history helps me feel comfortable with a boosted motor. I wouldn\\'t want to change technologies too fast, my 8 tracks still sound great... :P  Perna, you\\'re making me reminisce on my \\'02 Maxima (RIP). That car had some great pick up.I got to drive a Mazda6 rental car a couple of weeks ago. I have to say I was pretty impressed with the way the car handled. It was a 4-cylinder, so not always real powerful,but zippy enough. When my brother would come to town when I had the Maxima, he always liked to drive it whenever we would go out on the town, and he would punch that accelerator and make our heads kind of snap back in the seat and he\\'d get this look of \"wonder\" on his face.Unfortunately, he tries to do the same thing with my \\'07 Lexus RX. You won\\'t get the same reaction. (this makes me laugh all the time.)While my Rx has pretty good pick up for an SUV,it\\'s still not nearly as quick as the Maxima was!   I\\'m kind of surprised you don\\'t see more Maxima\\'s around. These are nice looking along with great performers. I wonder if they just get lost in the Acura/Lexus shadow..  I know this is gonna sound weird, but to me, the Lucerne looks better than either the Avalon OR the Maxima (although the Maxima update helped). A 19 year old likes a Buick? Well, out of the choices, yeah.  The Lucerne is growing on me also. But it\\'s a full-sized car. One thing GM does not lack is styling prowess.  Go test drive the Lucerne CXS and you\\'ll be even more impressed. Of course, in black. The ONLY color that it looks stunning in is black. Some cars look lame in black, but this looks perfect, like Mercedes E and S classes do.  Swirl marks and dirt = Black car.  \"reasons they\\'ve never caught on big in the states\" Yes they never did catch on big but rather than maintenance/repair costs the real reason was and still is cheap gasoline. Yeah, yeah it is over $3.00 per in most of the country but nowhere near the cost of gas in Europe. Diesel fuel, while still expensive is significantly cheaper there. And lets not forget some of the other reasons. Americans have long memories and many remember the GM diesel fiasco in the 80\\'s which unfortunately turned many against any sort of a diesel. Then there is the lack of availability for almost any diesel (other than commercial trucks and light trucks) car or SUV even though they are fabulous economy wise. Also, even those who had taken a chance (owned or drove) on a diesel 20+ years ago have no idea how technology has improved them. A modern direct injection turbo diesel is quiet..quick...economical..and long lived. It does not smoke...smell..rattle excessively at idle nor is it a slug. In short, nearly no one in this country knows just how good they really are. The fuel was only recently formulated for low sulfur content (important for emissions) and only recently have workable \"traps\" for particulates been introduced. Mercedes, I believe, can now pass EPA standards. So, I too would rather have a modern diesel than a hybrid that may never give \"pay back\" for the large up front cost premium. This isn\\'t even taking into account the largely unknown long term reliability of battery packs etc. However, these seem fairly reliable at this point. If Honda\\'s diesel becomes accepted (and it should) there could be a flood of diesel cars in this country, it is about time. Past time really.  two things-1) the thing that the Camry has always been and what is largely responsible for its success is that they are normally \\'softer\\', something not high on an enthusiast mags priorities but well up there with the average American carbuyer in this class, and 2) C/Ds COTY award has as much to do with a car\\'s \\'significance\\' as it does with any evaluation of a particular car\\'s dynamic capabilities. If 400 or 500,000 buyers a year doesn\\'t make the Camry significant, I don\\'t know what does.The Fusion V6, IMO, is not even in the same league as a Camry/Altima/Aura XR/Accord V6s, if for no other reason than what\\'s under the hoods.  C/D doesn\\'t do a COTY award. Maybe you are thinking about MT? That is the one that is much about \"market significance.\" And the 2007 Camry won that award. As you noted, 400k+ buyers is pretty significant.  C/Ds COTY award has as much to do with a car\\'s \\'significance\\' as it does with any evaluation of a particular car\\'s dynamic capabilities.I agree, the Aura didn\\'t win a comparison with the 07 Camry, it was just more significant (being a brand new model, and not a redesign of an existing car).The Fusion V6, IMO, is not even in the same league as a Camry/Altima/Aura XR/Accord V6s, if for no other reason than what\\'s under the hoods.I agree with this also. But, I think the Fusion\\'s interior would also put it a step down from these cars.  There are many days I wish I still had my diesel golf. But I agree with you 100%, I\\'d take a diesel over a hybrid any day of the week. I have no interest in a small subcompact car with a 1.3 liter engine. And your probably right about seeing more of them. Nissan will also be putting out a diesel maxima in 2 years, I think.I had to laugh when you mentioned the gm diesel\\'s. What a joke they were. If I remember correctly, they tried converting a gasoline engine instead of designing a true diesel engine.  The Fusion V6, IMO, is not even in the same league as a Camry/Altima/Aura XR/Accord V6s, if for no other reason than what\\'s under the hoods. You, and I, are certainly entitled to our own options. IMHO, the 3.0-liter Ford V6 is definitely competitive though not at the top of the mountain.The \"not in the same league\" comment seems off base, unless you have something on which to back up that opinion.  The Fusion V6, IMO, is not even in the same league as a Camry/Altima/Aura XR/Accord V6s, if for no other reason than what\\'s under the hoods. You, and I, are certainly entitled to our own options. IMHO, the 3.0-liter Ford V6 is definitely competitive though not at the top of the mountain. In the \"Camry/Altima/Aura XR/AccordV6\" league you are talking about, it is actually bottom of the mountain for output/acceleration performance. I can\\'t think of a car in the segment that offers less horsepower in top - V6 form, making it, the unfortunately-worded \"loser\" in that race (horsepower is only one aspect).Same league, yyyyeah, I guess they ought to be prounounced that. They are 3.0L - 3.5L V6s, all in 3,200-3,600 lb sedans. They aren\\'t the best incarnation/tuning of their respective engines (all but the Fusion make more horsepower in other variations). Beats \\'em in handling though.  Beats \\'em in handling though. Not exactly grad. The V6 Accord out handled the V6 Fusion. The Fusion just had a more \"sporty feel\", whatever that means.   To me the Fusion felt more nimble than the Accord. The Accord is very easy to drive fast, but the Fusion felt like it had less lean and higher limits.Now lets get a wagon version of the Fusion and get the I4 mpg up to Accord level and things are good.   Not exactly grad. The V6 Accord out handled the V6 Fusion. Curiousity got me...according to whom/what? I sort of felt the Fusion handled better but rode harder than the Accord. Everything I\\'ve read sort of said that too.  \"Also, even those who had taken a chance (owned or drove) on a diesel 20+ years ago have no idea how technology has improved them.

In short, nearly no one in this country knows just how good they really are.\"It\\'s what I traded in on my \\'07 Altima 3.5 SE. I bought an \\'04 NB 5 Spd GL TDI brand new in May, \\'04, when I was still making a 28 mile round trip up and down the North Dallas Tollway everyday. It broke in perfectly, only used 1/2 litre of the expensive 505.01 Castrol oil in the first 5,000 miles. Never got below 40 MPG in town even when new, and always averaged 45-47 over a tankfull. All its power was at the top of the pedal--going along at 65 in 5th, just had to think about it and I was around the next car. It did have an EGR cooler recall at 15,000 miles, then warranty replaced my tandem pump assembly at 16,000 miles. Within six months of purchase, the traditionally less-expensive than all other grades of gas diesel fuel completely traded places, remaining at or above the most expensive premium. In mid-05, I moved back to Waco and retired at end of \\'05--driving much less. Reading about some of the diesel\\'s characteristics on another website made me kind of nervous, especially in regards to the turbo going to pieces and such--also the only VW dealership being 30 miles away. When I read of the newly designed Altima with the CVT, I had to drive one and was instantly sold on it--also was getting tired of having to shift all the time. Got 80% of what I paid for the VW three years earlier after putting 18,500 miles on it. Got the Altima on 12/21/06, has 2,600 miles on it now. Within a short time, ALL gasoline grades had once again reverted back to being higher than any diesel, but I\\'m not sorry. One nice side-effect was, I discovered that I\\'d been hoodwinked into buying an extended warranty on the VW--told it was only $106, which seemed reasonable. Got a check for $806 two months after cancelling the VW warranty--had two amounts on the Advice of Remittance attachment, one for $106.01, then another for $699.99. They got me into it with the low price, then wrapped the remainder into my balance without me ever knowing it--that\\'ll help pay for some of the lower mileage on the Altima...  \"Americans have long memories and many remember the GM diesel fiasco in the 80\\'s which unfortunately turned many against any sort of a diesel.\"I actually ordered a brand new \\'80 Olds Cutlass with a diesel engine in January of 1980--I\\'d sold a \\'69 Hurst Olds with 36,000 miles on it for $4,000 and was using it as a downpayment on the $8,000 total price. In the meantime, I bought a \\'67 GTO convertible with 57,000 miles on it from the original owner which I\\'d been trying to buy since 1976. This happened two weeks before the Cutlass was supposed to arrive--told the dealer and he said no problem, even gave me back my $100 deposit when I said he could keep it--they could sell all the diesels they could build then. Used the $4,000 for the all original GTO--kept it almost 10 years and sold it for $12,500. Bought an all original \\'53 Cadillac which I still have--turned out to be the best thing I never did do!  Grad, this is the entire paragraph from Edmunds own V6 comparison test (Fusion 4th place). \"All who drove the Fusion remarked that it felt the most \"European\" of the four. With its taut chassis, confident steering and predictable handling, the Fusion exhibited a sophisticated-sporty nature that even the best handler of the group, the Honda Accord, lacked. In this regard, the Fusion excels in our group, but like a BMW, the trade-off is that this attribute takes it further away from what some might call a luxurious ride. Not many carmakers are ever successful in achieving both sporty and luxurious, but Ford has found a reasonable compromise in the Fusion. We doubt anybody would say the Fusion rides too harshly.\"  I took the Mazdaspeed6 for a test drive about a month ago and I thought it was great. Although my v-6 version is pretty fast and a touch lighter than the MS6, the higher torque and AWD was great coming out of corners. All the versions of the Mazda6 corner much flatter than all the cars I\\'ve driven in this class, so if you like twisties, this would be easily the best car in this class. I did like the steering character of the Legacy...more so than the Accord. It just felt more immediate and more connected. And like my previous Legacy, I found the AWD was great in cornering and managing quick starts without wheel spin. But the brakes on both the accord and legacy were wanting compared to the 6. I think most tests have both of these cars stopping 10-15 feet longer than the mazda6 and I think the mazdaspeed has better brakes than the v-6 too. The things the Accord has going for it, IMO, is the quality of the interior and their best-in-class manual tranny. The Mazda clutch is a bit stiff and engages quickly, but nothing you can\\'t get used to once you start to get the timing right. So would you ever consider a coupe? The 08 Accord coupe looks pretty good (much better than the sedan both current and future) and from what I\\'ve heard should be a bit more sporty than the current version. Problem will be the premium you\\'d have to pay if you were to buy within the first 6 months of release. And after having a coupe before (an accord) and dealing with the inconveniences, I would have a hard time going back to one unless it was a second car.From a value perspective, the current mazda6 is hard to beat either in v-6 form or direct injected turbo4 if you value handling. And if you want/need extra hauling capacity, the v-6 has a hatchback and wagon option.  The Fusion V6, IMO, is not even in the same league as a Camry/Altima/Aura XR/Accord V6s, if for no other reason than what\\'s under the hoods.You, and I, are certainly entitled to our own options. IMHO, the 3.0-liter Ford V6 is definitely competitive though not at the top of the mountain.Having owned the 3.0 Duratec for over a year now, I\\'m finding that I really like this engine. It is quick revving and responsive. At lower rpms, it\\'s quiet and very smooth while at higher rpms it has a nice linear surge of power to make things fun. I love the sound of it at higher rpms also...it has a nice growl to it. Anyone read the review edmunds did of the Noble M400 which uses the 3.0 Duratec? Sounds like an awesome car with an engine/package that outclasses a 911 or lotus. Maybe the Duratec 3.0 is in a different league... a higher one :surprise: :blush: Also, note the video clip with audio if you want to hear the engine.here\\'s the link: link title  How about this 3.0 liter engine?http://racing.honda.com/about/engine.aspx   I did like the steering character of the Legacy...more so than the Accord. It just felt more immediate and more connected. And like my previous Legacy, I found the AWD was great in cornering and managing quick starts without wheel spin.If you are cooking, the Legacy (wagon) rotates very well on corner entry, occasionally too well, but the car feels alive in corners. Heavy throttle in snow will bring the back end around also. All in all, pretty fun for something that holds car seats and a stroller.  MT, of course  With its taut chassis, confident steering and predictable handling, the Fusion exhibited a sophisticated-sporty nature that even the best handler of the group, the Honda Accord, lacked.I am confused...what is it that makes the Accord the best handler? Is it the 64.6 vs. 64.2 mph in the slolom??? To me handling is as much about feel as it is about a teeny tiny difference like that in performance. To me, the Accord steering is was just too light, because of this it lacks the right feel (for me).  the 3.0-liter Ford V6 is definitely competitive though not at the top of the mountain.certainly an opinion but something also substantiated by \\'full throttle\\' noise levels (dbs) which is higher (by a significant amount) in the DT (77 or 78db, if I recall correctly) than anything else in this class. And before you look up another V6 that tests out at say 75 and you think \\'competitive though not at the top of the mountain\\' do some research on the decibel scale. And then, once you get past the noise levels then you can compare the whole concept of a smooth vibration-free engine at higher rpms - something I\\'ve never seen an objective measure for, but also something easily experienced in a test drive or two. There is a lot more to an engine than simply HP figures even though the DT is deficient in that dept. as well. Not at the top of the mountain, positively - not even on an upslope probably.IMO the Toyota 2GR is easily the most refined and advanced engine in this group, although those entrants from Nissan, Honda, GM, and even Hyundai (probably in that order) come much closer. To many of us, what\\'s \\'under the hood\\' makes or breaks a car - and given that bias, any car with the DT V6 is broken. Haven\\'t had a chance to interview the 3.5 yet and it sounds like the \\'new and improved\\' DT 3.0 is still a coupla years away. The inability of that particular mfgr to produce a truly competitive smaller engine may yet be the death of them.   I am confused...what is it that makes the Accord the best handler? Is it the 64.6 vs. 64.2 mph in the slolom??? To me handling is as much about feel as it is about a teeny tiny difference like that in performance. To me, the Accord steering is was just too light, because of this it lacks the right feel (for me).Quoted for agreement. Numbers are only a part of how a car handles to me. The only way I can fairly judge handling is getting some time behind the wheel and putting it through it\\'s paces myself, and NOT by what some editor at a car magazine says.Having said that, is the Accord the better handler IMO? No. Not compared to the Mazda6 and Fusion. The 6/Fusion felt more stable in the twisties, and didn\\'t lean nearly as much as the Accord (as well as the Legacy) did.Again, this is all MHO.  Does it make the 6 and Fusion the best handlers out there? To me, yes. To anyone else, I hope not!  i agree as well. a lot of these things are subjective, and everyone has a different opinion of what good handling is. to say that honda is the better handler just because edmunds says so is just plain silly. for all we know, someone else could have said that the fusion was the better handler over the accord. what makes one magazine review more believable than the other? nothing. its all in what each individual finds to suit their needs.to sit here and say one car is better because of one review in one magazine is just plain ludicrous!my two cents at least...-thene   The 6/Fusion felt more stable in the twisties, and didn\\'t lean nearly as much as the Accord (as well as the Legacy) did. That is another good point...a higher speed through the slolom, but with more body leaning/rolling, does not a better handler make (IMO).  I don\\'t know, the bottom line is about the numbers, I think higher slalom speeds/lower lap times mean better performance. That doesn\\'t make for a more rewarding driving experience however.  ...substantiated by \\'full throttle\\' noise levels (dbs) which is higher (by a significant amount) in the DT (77 or 78db, if I recall correctly) than anything else in this class. And before you look up another V6 that tests out at say 75 and you think \\'competitive though not at the top of the mountain\\' do some research on the decibel scale.Noise inside the car is also affected by the amount of sound insulation, so this measurement may or may not tell you which engine is louder. You need to do some research on human hearing, not just the Db scale. Percieved loundness that you sense is a logarithmic function just like the Db scale...so, no 3 Db really is not much of a difference. You can find web sites that will let you hear this.Vibrations can be affected by things other than the engine itself as well.Just to clarify, I am just trying to keep thing factual. I am not on either side of the V6 engine refinement argument...I don\\'t even own one, I have a 4 cyl.  Well, back when they tested the Mazda6, it\\'s number was 64.9 mph in this slolom test :P  . And the Accord (which has not changed, right?) was an also-ran beating only the Malibu and the Sonata.2003-2004 Family Sedan Comparison Test  All this talk about \"best handler\" leads me to ask, is the Accord the best handler (in C/D\\'s view) of the cars they recently compared to the Accord, or of all family sedans?I ask this because... what about the Mazda6? It is an exceptional handler for a family sedan. It\\'s also IMO perhaps the best-looking of the current family sedans, even though the design is nearly five years old. And it\\'s a terrific value right now, especially the Special Value Edition that starts at about $20k MSRP, but can be had in my town with no haggling for $16,500 (so it might be had for even less with some negotiating). It is comparable in equipment to the Sonata SE I4, with 17\" alloys, ground effects, blacked-out lamps, power seat, leather wheel/shifter, CD changer, and a sport cloth interior. About the only major thing it doesn\\'t have that the Sonata does is ESC. But you get best in class (?) handling, a nicely-styled interior with quality materials, and a sporty exterior (at least for a family car). If I were buying a car right now, it would be on my list (especially with my Ford supplier discount and a $500-off-best-offer coupon I have for a local dealer).  well, of course, things like better insulation and engine isolation can make a difference in loudness and vibration. Given that and from your comments, I guess your contention must be then that Ford, for some reason, does a poorer job in this and therefore the DT is really every bit as smooth and quiet as what\\'s in some of these other cars? Horse puckey! Decibels are a measure of sound energy and increase logarithimically with value but is the only measure I\\'ve ever seen of how loud any car actually is. As I said earlier, a test drive by almost anybody will certainly confirm the whole refinement issue, or if you don\\'t choose to believe that, about any comparison/road test of any Ford vehicle (3.0 DT equipped) will usually make the same comments.And lest you Ford guys think this is all about \\'bashing\\', you shouldn\\'t take it as such, the engine issues are a simple comment that does have some historical and current basis in fact and a commentary on that particular manufacturer\\'s continued problems building a better car. Fix the engine and fix the car, IMO, everybody is better off (including this country\\'s (and Mexico\\'s) economy and the carbuyer benefits from having yet another good choice. Or put another way, put the Hyundai 3.3 liter in the Fusion and then you Fusionados/6ixers would really have something to talk about!  Given that and from your comments, I guess your contention must be then that Ford, for some reason, does a poorer job in this and therefore the DT is really every bit as smooth and quiet as what\\'s in some of these other cars? No, I have no idea if that is the case or not. My contentions are exactly what I posted and nothing more:1. There may potentially be other factors, besides the engine itself, that can affect measured noise level inside the cabin.2. 3 Db is not much of a difference. 3. Vibrations can be affected by things other than the engine itself as well.  The fact is the Fusion at idle is every bit as quiet as a Honda or Camry in 4cyl or V6 form. Granted, put the pedal down and the 3.0 comes to life and does growl a bit more. But 3db is NOT that much more. I ride in my friends 05 Honda Accord 4cyl and I cannot believe you folks here that claim it sounds smooth???? When he trounces the pedal it makes all kinds of racket. Even with the radio going, you cannot hear the radio. Perspective, and opinion are rampant. The Duratec 3.0 is a proven, reliable and capable engine. And does compete in this class. Finishing at most .8 seconds behind other V6\\'s in this class. I\\'m sure most won\\'t notice .8 seconds.. nor care. Since they will end up paying thousands less for a comparably equipped vehicle.  At my younger daughters soccer practice I ran into a guy who for a living modifies vehicles. He said he has an 07 Milan Premier V6 AWD. He put on true dual exhaust, an intake, chipped it, 18\" performance wheels/tires, tinted windows, spoiler. He claimed this car is outputting about 275HP. He is still under the price of a V6 Camry!!   He put on true dual exhaust - not very likely if he is still emissions legalan intake  - providing the sound you are going fast without actually going fastchipped it  - gotta lose the pesky speed limiter18\" performance wheels/tires  - because nothing helps handling and acceleration like super heavy wheels and tirestinted windows, spoiler - at least 50 hp right there He claimed this car is outputting about 275HP. - using recreational pharmaceuticals (driver, not car)I am all for modifying vehicles, but about the only thing on that list that could do much is the chip, and I don\\'t see that much tuning left in the computer for the chip to do that on its own.  There is no way he\\'s getting 275 hp, but saying that an intake and exhaust won\\'t give you performance gains is simply wrong. In fact, that will give you more power by itself than you can get from a re-flash or chip upgrade. And there\\'s no reason why adding a true dual exhaust (if true) would impact emissions.After all an engine is just an air pump and the more air you can get in and out the more power you can make. I figure the dual exhaust and intake are worth 20 hp, tops with the chip/reflash adding another 10-15 max (and probably requiring premium fuel).  but saying that an intake and exhaust won\\'t give you performance gains is simply wrong. In fact, that will give you more power by itself than you can get from a re-flash or chip upgrade.I am not saying there are no gains there, I am saying there is more noise than power. Also, you need to look at the existing system, if you were replacing a straw with a sewer pipe, that might be something, but its not like the system isn\\'t relatively free flowing in factory trim.I think you would have to have a pretty crummy exhaust to get 20 hp out of replacing it and if the intake is a ram air, it only works when you are forcing air through it at a high enough velocity, and if it is a cone filter, its not really buying you anything but noise.Chips can bump ignition (or valve timing) timing and re-tune fuel maps to provide better performance at the expense of fuel economy and emissions. I agree that it probably requires premium fuel. Chips aren\\'t as helpful as stand alone items, they are more to tune the car to other mods.And there\\'s no reason why adding a true dual exhaust (if true) would impact emissions. It depends where you are located, if you are in a CARB state you must have an exemption sticker stating that the component is certified as a factory replacement part. In theory, this is an EPA requirement everywhere, its just CARB states that police it. I guess its possible that he could have true dual manifold back exhausts with each exhaust having a second cat, but I doubt it.  Why do all that work? Buy the Camry with the 2GR and enjoy the same if not more power and get 30 MPG.  I would like to know what\\'s the resale price for that \"275HP Milan\" vs. a plain Jane Camry V6.  Intake mods also decrease fuel economy.  Also how much does it cost a \"paying\" customer to do what he did.  I would like to know what\\'s the resale price for that \"275HP Milan\" vs. a plain Jane Camry V6.If selling the car as a whole, I would start with the vehicle value and subtract the cost of the mods. Most modified vehicles I have had experience with were \"parted out\" prior to being sold, where they were basically returned to stock and the performance parts were sold separately.  Why do all that work? Buy the Camry with the 2GR and enjoy the same if not more power and get 30 MPG.Because you would be driving a Camry :P  This seems to verify that 60 mph slalom speed you posted for the Accord. I\\'m not sure how Edmunds was able to suddenly squeeze more out of the Accord. Was one an I4 and the others V6s? :confuse:  Factory intake and exhaust systems are tuned for less noise and lower cost. Adding a cold air intake and a true dual exhaust can significantly increase the airflow into and out of the engine and if you understand anything about internal combustion engines you know that\\'s the secret to more power. A cold air intake alone can easily add 10 hp. And production vehicles routinely add 5 hp with dual exhausts. So 20 hp from that setup is more than reasonable.I\\'m not advocating the changes that were made or the 275 hp claim. I\\'m only disputing some of your claims to the contrary.  Intake mods also decrease fuel economyAbsolutely not true. Everything else being equal a less restrictive intake and exhaust can actually improve fuel economy.  I would rather be driving a bone stock Camry V6 than a \"pimped\" out Milan that has less power and gets less FE. The Milan isn\\'t a bad car, but as is usual with Ford, it comes with an uninspiring powertrain.  If you are letting in more air (cold air intake), you are letting in more dirt also (tests have been done to prove this). If the exhaust is less restrictive, you may gain (very little) hp, but you will loose torque at the same rate (back pressure is needed for torque). The only way a \"chip\" will do any good at all, is if the engine computer was severely de-tuned in the first place, and then you are probably killing your gas mileage. People will make all sorts of claims to sell their products.  Let\\'s see this hot rod Milan\\'s dyno test sheet.  Thanks... I always frequent Edmunds\\' forums, but am guilty of not reading their own comparisons. When they are typically redundant with the magazines I take, I don\\'t see the point. I\\'ve never seen the Fusion come in last place though, I must admit.I hope I didn\\'t come off as snobby in my post, I just re-read it and realized how it sounded. It wasn\\'t intended!   The fact is the Fusion at idle is every bit as quiet as a Honda or Camry in 4cyl or V6 form. Granted, put the pedal down and the 3.0 comes to life and does growl a bit more. But 3db is NOT that much more.If it is 3 db louder, then it isn\\'t every bit as quiet as the Camry or Accord, is it? A little contradictory.The Duratec 3.0 is a proven, reliable and capable engine. And does compete in this class. Finishing at most .8 seconds behind other V6\\'s in this class. I\\'m sure most won\\'t notice .8 seconds.. nor care. Since they will end up paying thousands less for a comparably equipped vehicle. In the case of engine power, you pay less and get less with the Fusion V6. I doubt 40 horsepower is a deal killer for everyone, but for some, it just might be.  The average motorcycle that puts on a new filter(which lets in more dirt as well, as was noted in a past post) - and a unrestricted exhaust typically gains 15-20% more power.I can easily see a car gaining 20-30hp from those mods. Remember, they want them to pass smog and the easiest way to do that is to restrict it so that it\\'s barely running at idle.  to sit here and say one car is better because of one review in one magazine is just plain ludicrous! Ludicrous, nice word. The V6 Accord is regarded as the #1 V6 sedan by a lot more than just \"one magazine\". Who\\'s word am I supposed to take as truthful? Yours, I would rather take Edmunds word on it, thanks anyway. But the fact remains that my V6 Accord will go around a corner as fast, or faster than the V6 Fusion. I don\\'t spend my entire day seeing how fast my car will go around each corner though, so I would like a nice ride too. Which is another thing the Accord is better at.  Wrong. You can\\'t put more air through and burn more gas and get more hp at the same time increasing fuel economy. Hence the reason a lot of turbos tank in the fuel economy department.  engineerboy huh?? You have an engineering degree? Your telling me by opening up the intake and the exhaust this doesn\\'t give more HP???? :confuse: Yes, you can get dual exhaust and still be legal for emmissions. Just takes 2 caty converters.. for starters. By using performance wheels/tires this lightens the car, it doesn\\'t add weight?? what are you talking about? :confuse:  \"If it is 3 db louder, then it isn\\'t every bit as quiet as the Camry or Accord, is it? A little contradictory.\"Your not reading this correctly. At idle and in normal driving conditions the Fusion is every bit as quiet as an Accord/Camry. Nail the pedal, then the noise levels change.You keep posting DB levels at time when the cars are in hard acceleration. Somewhere way back, maybe in the last forum.. someone posted normal DB ratings for Fusion/Camry/Sonata/Accord and all of these cars were even or with in .1 of each other...\"In the case of engine power, you pay less and get less with the Fusion V6. I doubt 40 horsepower is a deal killer for everyone, but for some, it just might be\"40 HP looks good on paper. But in true reality its out .8 seconds... :shades:  quiet an uproar with this Milan Premier mod. I\\'m just the messenger. This guy was probably in his late 40\\'s early 50\\'s and has been around the mod circuit since he was a teen. So, I have to believe he knows what he is doing. He is going to bring the car to our next practice so I can see it along with taking me for a spin! Can\\'t wait should be fun...  Take a look at this site.. 30MPG for V6! NOT!!!http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/calculatorSelectEngine.jsp?year=2007&make=Toyota&model=Camry  So what\\'s your point? The Fusion has 48 less hp, and gets 2 mpg less than the Camry. You saying you got the shaft?  But the fact remains that my V6 Accord will go around a corner as fast, or faster than the V6 Fusion. Apparently that is the case as long as the 2006 edmunds tester is doing the driving, but not if the 2004 edmunds tester or the motor trend tester is doing the driving. Actually both perform just fine going by the numbers and I think the handling issue goes back to which feels better to the driver. The motor trend comparison that was linked says this about that for the Fusion:If 90 percent of what matters about a car to you is how it feels in your hands, the V-6 SEL version of this Mazda6-derived sedan could be your prize.OTOH, MT has this to say about Accord\\'s handling:Behind the wheel, the Accord is nimble, but not devoid of awkwardness. Walton: \"There\\'s a nonlinearity in the steering\\'s response.\" Entering a corner you feel \"an initial delay, then a gain as the tires grip, and finally a caboose feeling to the rear end.\"  Who\\'s word am I supposed to take as truthful? Yours, I would rather take Edmunds word on it, thanks anyway.This is what Edmunds\\' editors say:\"Editors\\' Most Wanted Vehicles for 2007Sedan Under $25,0002007 Mazda 6Winner: 2007 Mazda 6The 2007 Mazda 6 and Mazdaspeed 6 hold a special place among those who have driven them.

You also never said where the Fusion was 3 decibels louder, just that it was, which in essence, makes it louder than the others. You said it man, not me. Sorry. All my facts came from your own post.\"In the case of engine power, you pay less and get less with the Fusion V6.

I\\'m not doubting that it is about 1 second\\'s difference between the Fusion and the cars with more power previously mentioned. I\\'m saying you pay more and get more. .8 seconds is more than the difference in the Fusion V6 Auto (7.4), and the Honda Accord 4-cylinder Auto (8.1), according to Car and Driver. I\\'d be more than willing to bet you would say you can feel the difference that particular .7 seconds, but maybe I\\'m wrong. I\\'d bet that I could feel that difference too.Either way, my simple point was that you pay more and get more. The Fusion is a good car, but at the bottom of the pack in horsepower/acceleration for top V6 models.

Yeah! you finally admit the Accord is thousands more than a comparably priced FusionMoney well spent too. Pretty silly to annoint the year old Fusion with the kind of esteem the Accord has earned after many years of excellence. Lets see where the Fusion is in 4-5 years and 90,000 miles on it.

We know the Accord will still be tight. The Fusion is a mystery. Looking to be less of a mystery the more time goes on. Reliability ratings are looking very good for the Ford!   Your telling me by opening up the intake and the exhaust this doesn\\'t give more HP????Hmm perhaps my engineering degree helped critical analytical skills. I never said that opening up the intake and exhaust wouldn\\'t give more HP as a general rule. I was implying that the vehicle was already designed well enough (something I assumed you would agree with, given your cheerleading) that even if you cut off the exhaust entirely, you wouldn\\'t see that much of a performance gain. The same goes for the intake. I am a pretty big fan of modifications too and for certain vehicles it helps more than others (mainly boosted cars), but I don\\'t know about 55 hp on a 3.0l Duratec.[Edit] reflecting some more, perhaps that is why he needed the chip, so that he could get rid of the rev limiter because his mods shifted the power curve above the fuel cut for the motor. Moving the redline another grand or so might get it there.By using performance wheels/tires this lightens the car, it doesn\\'t add weight?? what are you talking about? Its not the concept of tires and wheels that I have an issue with, its wheels that are heavier than stock (I would like to see him weigh the 18\" bling bling wheels next to the 17\" stockers and see what is heavier, and then do the same for the tires. Replacing the 17\" stock wheels with BBS 17\" (17 lbs/wheel, thats pretty light, the 18\" were 23 lbs/wheel) or something that is even lighter would help, and going with a low profile R-compound performance tire would provide astounding performance while reducing weight.Rotating mass is considerably worse than dead weight elsewhere on the vehicle, and also increases unsprung weight (weight not controlled by they suspension, south of the shocks/springs, as it were) which is detrimental to handling. A 14\" Miata alloy wheel weighs 11 lbs, just food for thought.  http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/calculatorSelectEngine.jsp?year=2008&make=Buick&model=Lacrosse/AllureOMG?That\\'s not a Lucerne? And yes, that\\'s a V8. That site is full of future models that aren\\'t even in the press yet!Also note that almost every car they test with premium gas gets roughly 2mpg average worse than regular. This is understandable as higher octane gas has less energy.So they tested with premium fin the past to get more power and regular for the fuel economy ratings. What else do you expect from corporations? Heh.By the way, LOOK AT WHAT E85 DOES;http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/calculatorCompareSideBySide.jsp?column=1&id=23432We weren\\'t imaginaing that E85 kills your gas mileage!  \"The Camry V6 does NOT get 30MPG period\"If my heavier Avalon with the 3.5 can hit 30 on the highway (@ 70 - 75), why wouldn\\'t the Camry?  Wrong. You can\\'t put more air through and burn more gas and get more hp at the same time increasing fuel economy.Oh really?I know of more than a few Mazda 6 owners that have replaced their standard air filter and intake with an aftermarket Cold Air Intake (from companies like CP-E, Injen, and MazdaSpeed) and have actually experienced fuel economy thats 2-3 MPG BETTER than stock.CAIs help the engine to breathe better, and allows them to be more efficient as well. More efficient can (and does) lead to better fuel economy. It may not be the same for all cars, but for both the 4-cyl and V6 in the Mazda6, not only is it possible, but it happens as well.Hence the reason a lot of turbos tank in the fuel economy department.The BMW 335i has got a turbocharged V6 that puts out well over the advertised 300 HP (V8 territory) and I\\'ve seen fuel economy reports as high as 27 MPG on the highway. That\\'s better than most V8s, and even some V6s that don\\'t come close to 300+ HP.  Ludicrous, nice word. The V6 Accord is regarded as the #1 V6 sedan by a lot more than just \"one magazine\".

You cannot shove more air, burn more fuel for more hp and claim better gas mileage. And forget the highway mileage stuff. Take two cars, one modified, one not modified. Drive both of them exactly the same way for about 200 miles on city/suburban streets. Lot\\'s of fast acceleration and braking. Then tell me the modified car gets better mileage.Take a turbo car and drive about 100 miles in heavy city/suburban driving with fast acceleration and heavy braking. Check out the resulting mileage compared to epa estimates.  I don\\'t believe it period. You cannot shove more air, burn more fuel for more hp and claim better gas mileage.Believe it. It\\'s been proven time and time again. We\\'re not talking about forced induction, just allowing the engine to breathe better with cooler air. The engine runs more efficiently and produces more power which means (under NORMAL driving) you can use less throttle. One of the universal truths is that a dirty air filter kills your mpg and replacing it with a clean one improves mpg. This just takes that theory one step further.  Take a turbo car and drive about 100 miles in heavy city/suburban driving with fast acceleration and heavy braking. Check out the resulting mileage compared to epa estimates.If you get in any car and drive like a maniac I would say you are unlikely to get the EPA rated mileage. I think I am missing the point.If you get a turbo and stay under the boost or get a LPT, you will be rewarded with great fuel economy. If you boot the thing from every stoplight, my guess is that it will take its toll on mileage like any other car.  I don\\'t believe it period. You cannot shove more air, burn more fuel for more hp and claim better gas mileage. Just imagine your body as an engine. If you could increase your breathing capacity (air intake), you would be able to run more efficiently (faster/longer/less pain, etc.) than normal. Same as a car. And a car can take it one step further with an exhaust, the second part of the whole breathing equation. The better an engine can \"breathe\", the more efficient it is.  Just imagine your body as an engine. If you could increase your breathing capacity (air intake), you would be able to run more efficiently (faster/longer/less pain, etc.) than normal. Same as a car. And a car can take it one step further with an exhaust, the second part of the whole breathing equation. The better an engine can \"breathe\", the more efficient it is.But having more oxygen reduces ATP at the muscles allowing them to more efficiently burn sugars at the muscular level, so the reason you are running faster is because you can burn more fuel.  One of the universal truths is that a dirty air filter kills your mpg and replacing it with a clean one improves mpg. This just takes that theory one step further. Yes, but you are likely getting less filtering and letting more dirt into the engine...is this a good thing? Generally, the less restrictive the filter is the less filtering it is doing. A dirty filter reduces air flow, but actually filters better. You could let more air in by having no filter at all, too...do you want to do that to get more HP and better MPG, its just going one step further from the after market, less restrictive filters  .  You could let more air in by having no filter at all, too...do you want to do that to get more HP and better MPG, its just going one step further from the after market, less restrictive filtersI am not sure thats the case. Most air intakes (stock or otherwise) have some type of swirl inducer or something to create more turbulent airflow going into the motor. Apparently, more turbulent airflow has more exposed area for the fuel to bond with so you get better \"atomization\" (I think thats the term) for a better, leaner burn for more power with better MPG and still not killing emissions too much.  I had an \\'07 V6 XLE Camry for almost 1 year. Traded it for the \\'07 3.5Altima SE. My Camry got 34mpg on two lanes going 60 mph. When I was on the highway going 70 mph it fell to 31mpg. the minute I went 79, I try to keep it just under 80, it fell to 27.4. Just buzzing around town was where it really hurt, I\\'d get 17 to 19mpg. My Altima gets 28 at 80 mph and about 21 in town.  I don\\'t really know anything about \"intakes\", I am not one to do any modifying. I was only really addressing the filter issue. Read things from time to time about people wanting to put less restrictive filters on cars K&N gets bandied about for instance. It pretty much has to be the case that less restrictive=more dirt.  Of course you potentially allow larger dirt particles into the engine with a less restrictive filter. But I\\'ve never heard of that being a problem with K&N or similar filters or air intake kits. And we\\'re not talking about grains of sand here - the difference is very small.  Actually if you increase the filtered area you can maintain protection and increase flow.I for one would not mess with the factory filter. They want good mileage and hp, but not at the expense of engine life.  \"looks like I hit a soft spot huh??

I personally like the sound but given the discussion about how terrible it is that the Fusion is a few dB louder than the whatever car they were comparing it to, it would seem having a quiet motor is pretty important.Where the really big gains would be is if they used tighter engine controls and a wide-band 02 sensor. The O2 sensor would give a lot more information about the combustion process, and the fuel and ignition maps could be much better tailored to the conditions.  \"I ride in my friends 05 Honda Accord 4cyl and I cannot believe you folks here that claim it sounds smooth???? When he trounces the pedal it makes all kinds of racket. Even with the radio going, you cannot hear the radio\"This is the first time I have heard of the Accord\\'s 4 cyl being called an engine that creates a racket when revved up. Are you sure you were in a real Accord (not the imaginary one of your dreams that has a \\'rackety\\' engine)?  I would think mazda would have tried these solutions and come to the best arrangement. Its usually quite tough to improve upon a manufacturer\\'s design with obvious downsides.  this is almost exactly my experience with the same engine in my bigger/heavier Avalon - and sure \\'buzzing around town\\' I will usually see in the low 20s. To contend that a Camry (any other V6 engined car in this group including the Fusion) can\\'t get 30mpg is ludricrous, and pointing to the results of the new EPA testing procedures equally so. All cars will lose a coupla mpg or so with the new tests, especially those V8s and/or artifically aspirated engines. My Altima 3.5 (rated at 18/27 in 03), in my wife\\'s slightly more conservative hands, does a mpg (or so) worse as well.  I would think mazda would have tried these solutions and come to the best arrangement. Its usually quite tough to improve upon a manufacturer\\'s design with obvious downsides.A stock vehicle is full of compromises. Mazda could do a CAI if they weren\\'t as worried about the sound or water intrusion. They didn\\'t want to warranty a bunch of hydrolocked motors or hear people whining its too loud, so they didn\\'t. As I mentioned, I\\'m okay with the noise and don\\'t usually drive through lakes so I would be okay with the downsides associated with a CAI. Joe Camry probably wouldn\\'t be.I personally think the Accord rides too soft, while other people on this forum think its too firm. Aftermarket shocks would firm up the ride considerably, as would sport springs. Honda doesn\\'t want to upset Grandma Accord\\'s tender bottom so they make it a bit on the soft side.It\\'s not a matter of improving on a manufacturing design as much as optimizing a design to meet the individual\\'s needs.   I would think mazda would have tried these solutions and come to the best arrangement. Its usually quite tough to improve upon a manufacturer\\'s designThe best arrangement for the mfr is the one that provides the most cost/benefit. A few extra hp for a midsize family sedan isn\\'t usually worth the extra cost of a cold air intake. If they\\'re only selling 100K vehicles and the cold air intake costs $50 more than a paper filter and plastic intake that\\'s $5M in savings right there. If the cost is higher or the volume is higher then the savings would be even higher.Noise is also a much bigger design issue than you might think. There is usually plenty of room for minor improvments if you\\'re willing to spend some money and make slight compromises on noise and/or driveability.  HP I can understand; but wouldn\\'t it be a great benefit if they could increase mpg by 2-3 mpg? I would think it would be well worth the effort even if it cost $50 per car. Anyway, that\\'s just me.  If they could gain 2-3 mpg by spending $50 they would do it. That would mean they could sell more higher profit SUV\\'s without paying a penalty.Don\\'t get me started on why anybody would want to buy one of them (large SUV\\'s)  HP I can understand; but wouldn\\'t it be a great benefit if they could increase mpg by 2-3 mpg? I would think it would be well worth the effort even if it cost $50 per car. Anyway, that\\'s just me.I have no idea why they don\\'t use wide band O2 sensors and tighter tuning, that would do it. This is exactly what happened with the 2.0L Focus. It went from 34 to 37 mpg in 2005 because they better tuned the engine control parameters.  The real reason they restrict the engines is to be found on of all things, motorcycles. A restricted car that\\'s severely choked-off creates a lot less NOX emissions since there\\'s less oxygen in the equation. They do this with bikes all the time to get them to pass the new smog laws.And what\\'s the first thing a bike owner does? Replace the stock exhaust and filter. re-jet the carbs to run for maximum power as opposed to lowest pollution.(or in a FI system, re-chip it)It makes an enormous difference in higher compression engines, which tend to be the most restricted from the factory. Of course, they are right - a K&N filter was made for racing off-road, where a completely clogged with dust filter will blow up your engine. So there is a bit more wear and as a result, you\\'ll need to change your oil every 2000 miles.  \"HP I can understand; but wouldn\\'t it be a great benefit if they could increase mpg by 2-3 mpg?\"I agree with you. I would gladly pay for an upgrade to intakes/air filters/ecus etc, that provides more hp with the commesurate increase in fuel economy for about $100 worth of parts over the lifetime of the vehicle. The reason the manufacturers don\\'t do this stuff is:1. these methods don\\'t increase fuel economy2. engine longevity is potentially compromised  I got to ask, why is this so \"funny\" is it because its a Ford product and not a Honda or Camry? I do spend time on Honda forums. Young guys always want to know, how can I boost the power of my Accord? And the answer is always the same. Fast and reliable = not cheap (turbo/supercharger). Fast and cheap = not reliable (NOS). The fact that you believed this guy when he said he had 275hp, and then posted it on this forum, That\\'s funny. It does not matter what the make (Honda, Toyota, Ford, Chevy,) these modifications you mentioned (intake, exhaust, chip) will get you at most 20hp. A far cry from 54hp. The extra noise you hear coming from the intake and exhaust are only giving you the illusion of more power.  I do spend time on Honda forums. Young guys always want to know, how can I boost the power of my Accord? And the answer is always the same. Fast and reliable = not cheap (turbo/supercharger). Fast and cheap = not reliable (NOS).It depends how much you want to increase power and what sacrifices to drivability you are willing to make. A 50-shot of NOS isn\\'t going to affect very much, but a 100-shot or more might start to get dangerous. You could probably run 5-7 psi on a turbo without and intercooler and with relatively poor fuel management, but if you want to run 16 or 17 or more, you should have all your ducks in a row. Hondas can also look at aftermarket vtec controllers, which seem to do more to move the powerband rather than raise it altogether.Just swapping out intake/exhaust/chip isn\\'t going to get you too much power but isn\\'t really going to affect the longevity of anything either. All of my cars have had K&N filters because I like that you clean and re-use them as opposed to throwing them away. I have never had an internal engine problem based on close to 1,000,000 miles over 5 cars that have used these filters. Two cars have also had CAIs with no ill effects excepting the attention of the local constable.What I think is funny is that a couple hundred dollar investment in HPDEs or autocrosses would do more to make someone a better, faster driver than a few grand in bolt ons.  The most effective CAIs (letting in more air, without letting in more dirt) are the foam type, that you have to clean, then re-oil. Not many people are willing to do this for the small (maybe 5 hp) gain. Not to mention the prices of some CAIs is crazy. Then there is always the chance of going through one deep puddle of water, and screwing your engine up. Not worth it, to me anyway.   the accord is not for everyone...it\\'s certainly not for me.Point taken. I am not saying the Accord is for everyone. I just don\\'t agree with those who say the Accord leans in turns (like a Camry or Sonata) and doesn\\'t handle well. The Accord handles with the best of them.  1. these methods don\\'t increase fuel economy2. engine longevity is potentially compromised1. Wrong2. Wrong again  We\\'ll have to agree to disagree. The only real way to up hp is to chip or mod a turbo, that gives a significant performance boost at the expense of fuel economy.  mazda does offer a mazdaspeed intake which when installed by a dealer does not effect the warranty of the car. dynos have indicated that hp and torque benefit making the car a bit more responsive at lower rpms. but as lilengineerboy mentioned, it does make the car have a louder growl to it. some may like this, others not. but since the larger target market is generally more conservative, I\\'d expect manufacturers to compromise on some things.  Why do so many people report a slight increase in fuel economy after installing a cold air intake? We\\'re not talking about a lot - maybe 0.5-1.5 mpg but it\\'s still an increase, not a decrease. And it\\'s only adding maybe 10 hp - maybe 15 with an exhaust upgrade. I don\\'t understand why that\\'s so hard for you to accept.  Why do so many people report a slight increase in fuel economy after installing a cold air intake?Simple, they have to have some explanation for spending $2-300 on an air filter.  \"If you and I can both get over EPA numbers in our cars, why would you claim a Camry CAN\\'T hit its numbers, when you don\\'t own one and haven\\'t driven one extensively on the highway? \"I guess the same way the other person can claim the Fusion gets lower mileage... wow, talk about some serious bias going on here...   \"Lets see where the Fusion is in 4-5 years and 90,000 miles on it. We know the Accord will still be tight. The Fusion is a mystery\"Dejavue!! I heard this same story in 2001 when I bought my Escape from the CRV owners. After 75,000 hard miles, towing watercraft, visiting ski areas and finding fishing spots in the Cascade range.. my Escape was tight as day 1, ran great and never had ANY issues..  \"I am a pretty big fan of modifications too and for certain vehicles it helps more than others (mainly boosted cars), but I don\\'t know about 55 hp on a 3.0l Duratec.\"Why? because its a Ford engine? Other makers with 3.0 engines get more HP? Why can\\'t Ford? This engine is actually capable of producing over 300HP. I\\'ll have to dig back and fine the article showing this. As a matter of fact I believe the 3.0 was put in either a Lincoln or a Jag and was putting out about 250-260HP.. The Duratec is a great little engine and has a history of reliability and durability.  Don\\'t know, why don\\'t you ask the folks that wrote the report? :shades:  \"That\\'s life - tough luck!!! Gold standards are gold standards. \"This is funny.. In your own mind my friend..   \"If you and I can both get over EPA numbers in our cars, why would you claim a Camry CAN\\'T hit its numbers, when you don\\'t own one and haven\\'t driven one extensively on the highway? \" I guess the same way the other person can claim the Fusion gets lower mileage... wow, talk about some serious bias going on here... Back up the bias bus a second...In identical test conditions, the Fusion DOES get lower mileage, which validaidates the claim.When comparing apples to apples as best we can (the EPA offers the best option for common ground here), the Fusion gets lower mileage than the Camry. There\\'s nothing giving credence to your statement of \"The Camry CAN NOT hit 30 MPG, period.\" Maybe \"in your own mind, my friend.\" In the REAL world, owners, and EPA disagree with that baseless claim (or did you have basis that you didn\\'t share with us?)  \"This is the first time I have heard of the Accord\\'s 4 cyl being called an engine that creates a racket when revved up. Are you sure you were in a real Accord (not the imaginary one of your dreams that has a \\'rackety\\' engine)? \"Ever thought maybe it is loud? I owned an Accord in 2000 and it was not this \"refined\" sounding machine that some want others to believe. This car was loud at full throttle. I have driven both a 4cyl Fusion automatic and have also test drive an 06 Accord 4cyl Automatic. Its all in what you want to believe. Both of these vehicles exhibit engine noise when pushed.  I owned an Accord in 2000 and it was not this \"refined\" sounding machine that some want others to believe. It\\'s not \"wanting to believe\" scape. Last I checked, lots of people had lots of different perceptions about things. Which, iirc, is why you drive a Fusion and I drive an Accord. We placed different values on different aspects of a vehicle.  This I agree with. I am seeing very good MPG numbers from my Fusion. I am averaging 24.2 MPG in my daily commute to work. I drive about %60 freeway to work. On my last road trip I did an amazing 32 MPG to Idaho. This was per my computer and Yes, I should have done it by paper also just to check. Next time I will. In order to achieve this 24.2MPG I have been very conscious of my speed and acceleration from a light. I am hoping to reach at least 25-26MPG as an average.  *sigh* Why? because its a Ford engine? No, becuase it is already relatively optimized in that application, it doesn\\'t require premium fuel, it doesnt have VVT, etc.Other makers with 3.0 engines get more HP? Why can\\'t Ford? This engine is actually capable of producing over 300HP. Stock and modified motors are very different. A stock 300 hp motor isnt the same as one that has been tuned and peaky to hit 300 hp. Im not saying the 3.0L duratec requires that either, just that it doesnt in the Fusion.I\\'ll have to dig back and fine the article showing this. As a matter of fact I believe the 3.0 was put in either a Lincoln or a Jag and was putting out about 250-260HP. Yes, with VVT and premium fuel, a different engine control strategy, different heads, different intake and exhaust manifolds, mildly underdriven pulleys, etc. The Duratec is a great little engine and has a history of reliability and durability.You are preaching to the chior here, I think the Contour w/a 2.5L V6 and a stick was one of my favorite cars ever. Even that car required a lot of work to get from 170hp to the 200hp in the SVT (premium fuel, revised manifolds, extrude hone intakes, higher compression, changing ignition maps, differnt exhaust system, etc).  The real reason that they restrict them is because it makes them PASS EMISSIONS. No other reason. It kills low-end power and the car is barely running at idle when it pollutes the most. It also hurts emissions a bit as well, but there\\'s just no other way to get a typical small turbo to pass smog other than remapping the ECU and restricting the exhuast and intake.Fixing it - it makes the engine work like the designers wanted. Some guy in Germany who makes the engine designs it and THEN they go \"oh gheez - look at the god-awful smog regulations in California!\" So they tweak the auxiliary components and computers and such to make it work. But it\\'s jsut not the way it came off the designing board.More power, better low-end peroformance, better fuel economy... But emissions are really going to be tough to pass(though it\\'s possible with a few tricks)  \"This engine is actually capable of producing over 300HP.

The Duratec is a great little engine and has a history of reliability and durability.\"I found the article for you, I remember reading it when it was first posted. 2007 Noble M400\"In the United States, the M400 is classified as a kit car because its chassis, engine and transmission are sold separately. The rolling chassis is actually built in South Africa, and 1g Racing in Hamilton, Ohio, sells it for $72,500. The basic 3.0-liter Ford Duratec V6 is assembled by AER Manufacturing in Carrollton, Texas, and lists for $4,400. Snakebite Performance, 1g Racing\\'s parts division in Ross, Ohio, sells the transaxle and all the ancillary turbocharging hardware for $17,700.\"\"Motivation comes from a seemingly harmless 3.0-liter Ford Duratec V6 that has been transformed by two Garrett GT25R turbochargers calibrated by Roush Racing. The turbos deliver 12.5 psi of boost with minimal lag, enough to make 425 hp and an equally impressive 390 lb-ft of torque.\"\"A professional installer can put the Noble M400 on the road in about 30 hours at a cost between $3,500 and $4,000. Add it all up and you\\'re looking at close to $100,000 for a kit car.\"Evidently it is possible to acheive 425 hp by taking a Duratec and completely rebuilding it to racing specs for a few thousand dollars while adding $17,700 worth of performance parts. That is over 140 hp per liter.I bet it has a cold air intake   \"I don\\'t understand why that\\'s so hard for you to accept.\"People also report a decrease in fuel economy. Why don\\'t you accept it?  \"better fuel economy\"Better fuel economy means lower emissions, if they can do it.  \"Evidently it is possible to acheive 425 hp by taking a Duratec and completely rebuilding it to racing specs for a few thousand dollars while adding $17,700 worth of performance parts. That is over 140 hp per liter.\"Let me understand this. Take any engine, put $20K+ of development and parts into it and you can transform it into a monster that is not street legal.Works for me.  People also report a decrease in fuel economy. Why don\\'t you accept it?I do accept that - if they drive it harder than they did before. I said \"all things being equal\" and \"when driven normally\".Allowing the engine to breathe more easily (naturally, not by forcing more air in) makes it run more efficiently and a more efficient engine uses less fuel. If you don\\'t want to accept a sound scientific theory with field test data to back it up that\\'s your prerogative.  \"In your own mind my friend\"And in the minds of more than 800,000 Americans every year, who buy the Camcords.  Since the Mazda 6 has been marketed from the beginning as a sporty alrernative to mainstream family sedans, I would think Mazda would have gone with the intake, even at the cost of some increase in engine noise - this target market anyway likes throaty engines.  \"I guess the same way the other person can claim the Fusion gets lower mileage... wow, talk about some serious bias going on here... \"This post makes no sense.

That is what I don\\'t believe.I believe the Accord\\'s 4 cyl engine is universally accepted to be one of the best 4 cyl gas engines out there, as well as an engine that likes to be revved up while sounding very smooth at high revs. In fact that has been a strong point of all Honda VTEC and iVTEC engines. Not noise.  \"We\\'re not talking about a lot - maybe 0.5-1.5 mpg but it\\'s still an increase, not a decrease.\"Okay, so the expected increase is .5 to 1.5 and not the 2-3 mpg someone earlier stated. That makes it clearer.  folks - there\\'s no point in arguing about V6 engines - we all know that nissan\\'s VQ series engines are the best V6 engines out there! -thene <--nissan biased :blush:  what you are leaving unsaid, (in typical scape fashion) is that under those same circumstances that you can coax 32 mpg out of your Fusion, a Camcordima is going to do a coupla mpg BETTER, cars you earlier claimed couldn\\'t ever/never hit 30 mpg. How do I know this you ask? Owning a couple of of them helps but also because that is what the relative difference is in the EPA hwy ratings - UNLESS, of course, you really want to try to sell the rather preposterous proposition that the EPA itself is also somehow biased specifically against Ford products? Fact is that not only does the DT cost its owners some gas it also costs them a rather significant chunk of HP. The prices of progress, or should I say the lack of it!  folks - there\\'s no point in arguing about V6 engines - we all know that nissan\\'s VQ series engines are the best V6 engines out there! As long as you like big engines that require premium fuel :P  while you won\\'t get a whole lot of argument out of me (I own an Altima 3.5 and previously a coupla Maximas). I am of the opinion, that the design is somehow getting a little long in tooth and the engine isn\\'t currently as smooth and refined as the Toyota 2GR (and yes, I own one of these as well). May have something to do with the C and the i on the Toyota valvetrains and not on the Nissans, I\\'m not sure. The one thing the 2 year old 2GR doesn\\'t have that the VQ does, however, is a long and proven history. The VQ will be at the top of any list of the best 6 cylinder engines ever built (along with the BMW straight 6s), but I do prefer my 2GR to my wife\\'s VQ - the Toyota engine being smoother, more powerful and more economical - and I too will admit to being Nissan biased   big engines that require premium fuel THEY DON\\'T, my 240hp 03 Altima been running just fine on regular for about 75000 miles now - as in the Toyota engine, the owners manual simply recommends premium \\'for maximum performance\\'.  THEY DON\\'T, my 240hp 03 Altima been running just fine on regular for about 75000 miles now - as in the Toyota engine, the owners manual simply recommends premium \\'for maximum performance\\'.So you bought a performance motor and use crummy gas? I think there is some lost logic here. Do you change your oil at the \"recommended\" intervals or do you wait 3 years between changes because it \"runs fine?\"If the manual says to use premium, for comparison purposes it uses premium.  not nearly the point because the difference (4 or 5 hp) is minimal. Case in point - the Lexus ES350 rated on premium at 272 HP, the mechanically identical Camry rated at 268 on regular. I guess folks that pay the badge premium for that ES expect to pay the extra $.20 a gallon, while those that buy the Camry are more sensitive to things like that. Besides if anybody on this forum should understand what these new high tech engines do relative to changes in spark and valve timing relative to detonation, than you would also understand that it really doesn\\'t make any difference except for those few HP.Would suggest to you that most Camry V6 drivers put regular in their cars simply because they can save a few bucks every fillup, don\\'t hear or feel anything different with \\'crummy\\' gas, and then by your assumptions of ignorance must wait until their oil pressure drops to 0 before they ever even open the hood again. :confuse: \">  I have a 2 GR as well, absolutely nothing wrong with using regular, as was already stated, the manual suggests for improved performance premium may be used. I can\\'t tell a bit of difference in the few tanks of premium I tried.  but the larger market for midsize sedans isn\\'t always interested in a throaty intake note. the enthusiasts are which is probably why mazdaspeed makes available a CAI that does not destroy the factory warranty. but Mazda does not want to sell the 6 to enthusiasts only...it is still a midsize sedan after all. most enthusiasts aren\\'t too concerned if a 42\" plasma will fit in the hatchback or even if their car has 4 doors. so if the 6 had a chance of growing market share from the 626, it still had to have some appeal to the larger market of those who were interested in a midsize sedan which probably meant making an attempt at keeping noise levels down (amongst other compromises that they made to make the ride more comfortable). and I\\'m sure mazda knew those who really were interested in modding their cars would and would be willing to pay extra for it which means more money for mazda by offering their own CAI. and there are some places where you may not want a CAI... for example very rainy areas that are flood prone. one other point... imagine mazda said to customers \"we have a part that costs extra that will slow down your car but will make it a bit quieter at wide open throttle.\" that would be a hard sell imo. whereas it would be far more palatable if they were to say \"we have a CAI which adds power and torque while giving it a more throaty intake note.\" which would you rather try to sell?  Would suggest to you that most Camry V6 drivers put regular in their cars simply because they can save a few bucks every fillup, don\\'t hear or feel anything different with \\'crummy\\' gas, and then by your assumptions of ignorance must wait until their oil pressure drops to 0 before they ever even open the hood again.I guess I lump that in the same category as those who buy the performance suspension and then replace the tires with either the cheapest thing available or a highway tire and wonder why their car doesn\\'t handle as well as it used to.Like I said before, manufacturers make cars to meet the needs of the masses. People then optimize the car for uses as they see fit. I think that if I wasn\\'t going to spring for premium, I would go for a car that didn\\'t require (or \"recommend\") it. I\\'m glad your vehicle is working out well for you.  nope - don\\'t mind! and like captain said, its not required, its recommended. if you don\\'t mind losing a little HP or fuel economy, you are more than welcome to use regular.though supposedly this new VQ with the VVTL technology (i think thats the acronym) that they are going to be using in the new Infiniti G37 is supposed to be more fuel efficient than its 3.5L bretheren.btw, i don\\'t have a car with a VQ now - i have a 4cyl Nissan Sentra Spec-V (though i sold nissans for 2 years and had plenty of enjoyment behind the wheel of an altima/maxima/z) and now, back to your regularly scheduled honda vs. ford thread!-thene :P  have a 4cyl Nissan Sentra Spec-V (though i sold nissans for 2 years and had plenty of enjoyment behind the wheel of an altima/maxima/z)I think I actually prefer the Spec-V to the Maxima. Well sized, good torque, and a real limited slip differential. Oh and a nice 6 speed transmission. I also liked the Altima SE-R of the last body style.  Let me understand this. Take any engine, put $20K+ of development and parts into it and you can transform it into a monster that is not street legal. Where did it say it wasn\\'t street legal? Isn\\'t it possible to modify an engine to that extent and still drive it on the street? Some of the Calloway and Lingenfelter Vettes and the Hennessey Vipers come to mind.It is kind of impressive that the Duratec 30 was selected for that purpose.  and now, back to your regularly scheduled honda vs. ford thread! Now that\\'s funny  .  i like it too - i have a sunburst yellow one (2003) which had the aggressive looking front facia - not the big snaggle tooth that nissan thought was a good idea it really is a fun car to drive, plus it gets good gas mileage!-thene   i like it too - i have a sunburst yellow one (2003) which had the aggressive looking front facia - not the big snaggle tooth that nissan thought was a good ideait really is a fun car to drive, plus it gets good gas mileage!The factory limited slip makes it a great car for autocross and HPDEs. My friends and I had a few earlier (classic?) SE-R/NX200 (SR20s) and they were very fun and easy to drive on the track. The limited slips really made a big difference coming out of the turns.  In my state, you probably would not be able to take any engine, make any ol\\' change and have it pass inspection. Other states don\\'t care.My definition of street legal refers to a 50 state inspection pass.

I didn\\'t realize this was a performance car thread! Instead of buying a midsize, perhaps some of this folks should consider a different model of car. This last spec I consider, especially with those models covered under the header of this thread, is its 0 to 60 time.  In order of importance1. Reputation for reliability2. Comfort3.

Why do people strive to own BMW or Mercedes when these vehicles don\\'t have that great of reliability? Name and status are important.  Style/Image are higher on some priority lists than others. I am much more concerned with what the car is made of (the sum of it\\'s parts) than what it looks like. What you think looks stylish, others may think is ugly. Some people love Nissan\\'s style, for instance. I think they make some of the wierdest looking cars on the planet. Style is subjective.  This is interesting. I wonder what the HP/torque loss or mileage loss is when regular is run in the Camry.. Not much, I bet. The way the premium vs regular thing was explained to me was:Only cars with higher compression ratios need premium. But, all cars engine\\'s are computer controlled, and the sensors more or less know what type of fuel you\\'re putting in. If the sensors in a high compression engine detect low octane fuel, the computer will just compensate for it by advancing the timing and tweaking a couple other things in the engine. as it was explained to me.  \" wonder what the HP/torque loss or mileage loss is when regular is run in the Camry.. hmmm.\"None... the advertised power rating of 268 was with regular. Using 91 Octane yields 4 more HP.Here is a link...Toyota GR Engine  This just once again shows my point about the bias against Ford products. I\\'m sure there is a bias to ford products. Too many people have been burned by ford in the past. There is a reason their sales have declined as bad as they have. Take me for instance. I KNOW the fusion is a good, well built car. Its probably the best car ford has made in awhile. But, I\\'ve owned fords in the past, and they were nothing but problems. Never major things (I wasn\\'t constantly swapping engines) but it was just so many little things. Like being pecked to death by a thousand chicks. So, about 15 years ago I started buying asian cars. And they never gave me 1/10 the hassles of the fords I owned. Is it fair to hold against ford problems I had with their products 15 years ago? Probably not. But as the song goes, once bitten twice shy.  I would put brand name up at 1 or 2 to begin with.. We are a society that thrives on brand names.. Ok, so your list would have brand name at 1 or 2. Elroy placed it a 10. Where\\'s the rest of your list? Frankly, I\\'m not driving a $22,000 Honda badge. I\\'m driving the best $22,000 vehicle for my needs.  Why do people strive to own BMW or Mercedes when these vehicles don\\'t have that great of reliability?Because there are more aspects to a car than reliability. Last I checked, Ford Fusions and Honda Accords don\\'t come with things like active-steering, active seat-bolsers, 14-way power seats, sport-handling packages, 18\" wheels, Xenon headlights that swivel around turns, or 360 + horsepower engines, like the Mercedes\\' and BMWs of similar size. THAT\\'S part of the reason people strive for BMW and Merc. Is prestige part of the equation? Sure. But it isn\\'t the end-all.Performance, uniqueness of style... you know, some of the reasons you bought YOUR car are probably included in the reason people buy Mercedes\\'.  That order is basically the same as mine.Reliability is always #1 to me. I don\\'t need prestige if the car often fails this and that. To me, prestige will fade away if it does that.Therefore, according to statistics, in the years that I could see, no European cars for me, only Japanese for now...  \"This is interesting.

Both cars will have outliers in mileage, most are likely due to odd driving conditions (driving very short distances, or driving a lot of stop and go, or very high highway speeds, etc...). People complaining of fuel economy (regardless of the car) have to be taken with a grain of salt, because one person\\'s idea of a \"normal\" drive is likely different from yours or mine.That being said, in identical, regimented, driving conditions, the Camry got higher numbers than the Fusion V6, Accord V6, Sonata V6, and most of the other competitors as well (if not all).  \"McDonalds sells more burgers because they are cheaper, and there is one on every corner.

I do have a few other examples that I could gove to Scape, but I guess it just doesn\\'t matter to him. He feels the world is agianst Ford!!!!  Don\\'t you know thegrad; the Fusion is the best car ever made, and no one in the world needs anything more or less than a Fusion. Guess every carmaker should stop making their cars and start making Fusions under license from Ford. Maybe then the US car market would look like the erstwhile East Germany with the Trabant (the only car that was available there for donkey\\'s ears = the only car anyone would ever need!!!!!  \"This goes to show what little people really know about the Fusion.

Must be a wonder of an engine. No wonder people are biased.  If everyone drove them, that uniqueness that some people pride themselves on would be lost! What to do then? Call it a Taurus? A little Ford humor. *Slaps own wrist*  Why do people strive to own BMW or Mercedes when these vehicles don\\'t have that great of reliability? Because more is better. They have more performance, more luxury, more style and sophistication. People who are willing to spend that much money on a car, are not worried about reliability issues, and the associated costs. They will probably buy a new one before the warranty runs out anyway.  Only cars with higher compression ratios need premium. But, all cars engine\\'s are computer controlled, and the sensors more or less know what type of fuel you\\'re putting in. If the sensors in a high compression engine detect low octane fuel, the computer will just compensate for it by advancing the timing and tweaking a couple other things in the engine.as it was explained to me.It was explained to you incorrectly. The engine doesn\\'t sense the octane level of the fuel. The engine has a knock sensor. Higher compression engines need higher octane fuel that\\'s less likely to pre-ignite or detonate (knock). Using lower octane fuel in an engine designed for higher octane fuel can result in knocking which the engine computer detects and compensates by retarding (not advancing) the timing. Retarding the timing reduces both power and fuel economy. If the engine can\\'t compensate enough by retarding the timing then damage can occur.  But that\\'s just not true. The amount it reduces the power is significantly less than the difference in energy contained in non-premium fuel versus the premium(regular has more energy in it)If you look at the EPA site, there are a couple of cars that are tested with 91 and 87 - and in every case, the 91 results in 1-2mpg *less*, as expected.E85 is 30-40% less!There is no free lunch - it all is really about the amount of energy in the fuel itself and the mass it has to move.  If you look at the EPA site, there are a couple of cars that are tested with 91 and 87 - and in every case, the 91 results in 1-2mpg *less*, as expected. Interesting, can you indicate some specific vehicles. Don\\'t take that wrong, not disputing your information...I am honestly curious about this. I\\'d have assumed (if anything) marginally better mileage with higher octane.  \"If you look at the EPA site, there are a couple of cars that are tested with 91 and 87 - and in every case, the 91 results in 1-2mpg *less*, as expected.\"Here are some links. The consensus is:1. running premium in a car car designed for regular probably has no benefit and may decrease gas mileage,2. running regular in a car designed for premium, won\\'t hurt the engine, but performance and possibly mileage will suffer, since the engine cannot operate as efficiently as designed.http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041008.htmlhttp://www.caranddriver.com/article.asp?section_id=4&article_id=3604&page_number=1http://ideas.4brad.com/node/277I\\'m assuming you are referring to situation #1, not situation #2 in your post.  Everything I posted is correct. It\\'s not about the fuel itself - it\\'s about how the engine is tuned and the effect that the octane rating has on the combustion process.Forcing the computer to retard the timing to prevent knock will reduce both power and fuel economy. By the same token advancing the timing will increase power and fuel economy because it makes the engine more efficient. That\\'s why reflashing or chipping a car improves power but often requires premium fuel.  That\\'s where my factory ordered Mazda6 will be built. I was told they also build the Ford Mustang there. Have there been any recent problems wiht the Mustang? Press is very positive as to the 6.  Adjustments will no doubt have to be made by the workers when switching from a Mustang to a 6. Can they do it without too many problems, is the question.  From a Govt Site:E85 is then a blend of denatured ethanol and gasoline, therefore:Denatured Ethanol @ 77,815 btu/gal x 85%=66,143Gasoline @114,132 btu/gal x 15%=17,120E85=83,263 btu/gal114,132-83,263=30,869 difference.27% less energy. But since the typical driver drives the same speed as they are used to, they press harder on the pedal to compensate instead of loafing along at 73% of the HP.Since it takes more gas to make up the energy difference AND the fuel itself has less energy per unit(ie - the injectors don\\'t spray 27% more fuel) - this results in a small factor of magnification of the effect.So the real loss is closer to 35-40% mpg!Too bad E85 doesn\\'t cost 60% what Gasoline does. That\\'s the real rub - it\\'s a hidden way for the oil compnaies to make more money.****http://www.chevron.com/products/prodserv/fuels/bulletin/oxy-fuel/enrgycon.shtmlThis covers oxygenated gas. Why is this important? It\\'s a dirty trick most companies use today. They mix in MBTE because it increases the octane rating. The net effect is that they make 83-85 octane gas and blend in enough EBTE and additives to get it to 87, 91, or 93 octane.So the higher the octane with oxygenated gas, the worse your mileage is! With non-oxygentated gas, it should be the same, but then again, running premioum in a non-premium engine, as the previous poster pointed out above - can also result in lower mileage as most 87 rated engines don\\'t have computers to adjust for better fuel(as opposed to premium engines which always are made to compensate for lower quality fuel)*edit - from the second link above:\"But, noted Schiller, only a few vehicles calibrated for regular fuel can advance timing beyond their nominal ideal setting when burning premium. \"***P.S. Oxygenated E85 would yield 30% less energy - a double hit!  Good analysis. But I draw a different conclusion of who is making the money. It\\'s not Big Oil...it\\'s Big Government, at state and national levels. National gov\\'t takes $.184 per gallon, my state takes $.25 per gallon plus 6.3% of the wholesale price. Whenever the price goes up the state grabs more money without raising the tax RATE. Add in all the different blends/formulations the government requires across the country and factor that into their cost of doing business. Then take all of the corn which will be used to make E85 out of food chain, whether for people or animals, and you\\'ll see nonpetroleum prices increase. How much? I don\\'t recall, but I\\'ve read $1 a pound or more for a steak is likely. Here in the great liberal north east we\\'ve had MBTE and oxygenated gasoline blends mandated by our governments forced upon us for years. I believe the *$#&@ governments make more per gallon than the oil companies and certainly more that the gas station owner. And the government doesn\\'t do dink, except sit back with their hands out to collect the money from the people who explore, drill, transport, refine, transport again and then run a retail operation to make the product readily available.  Its not big government thats making money through ethanol, its the farmers. the government gets a fixed amount per gallon. but with more and more of the countries corn crop being diverted to ethanol production, the price of corn has doubled. brace yourself for a big spike in the price of beef and dairy products (cows are fed primarily corn). And we\\'re not going to see the worst of it. A lot of poor countries depend on corn from the US. And less of it will be available for export, and at a much higher price. and to make things even worse, oil companies are now shelving plans to expand refinery capacity, because the government (especially bush) is telling everyone they\\'re going to cut gasoline consumption by 20%. The oil companies figure no point in spending 10\\'s of billions of dollars to expand production when washington is promising decreased consumption.  Are we really using that much ethanol? I haven\\'t seen a station that sells it yet around here (Louisiana). Maybe that\\'s because I\\'m not looking for it though. :confuse:  its being blended into the gas. you can have up to 15% ethenol blend in a normal gasoline engine.  All excellent points, except I still believe the governments be huge beneficiaries as we will be using more gallons of fuel for the same driving. Gov\\'t taxes per gallon & my sorry state has that \"gross earnings\" tax on 6.3% , going to 7% on July 1. Bush may be part of the problem but he\\'s not the primary cause. In the last 30 years, every attempt to build a new refinery has been shot down. Then, there\\'s ANWR, an area about the size on North Carolina...they want to drill in an area less than the size of my small town and think they\\'re talking about something like 2 square miles. The left just doesn\\'t want any new drilling in any area they can control (within US borders)...and they block new refineries. You\\'re right on about corn to other countries and the price of beef and dairy.  Your preaching to the choir, I agree with you on most of that. The reason no new refineries have been built is primarily because its more cost effective to expand existing ones, which the oil companies do. But, as recently as the early 90\\'s (remember the recession and .69 gas) the oil companies had a lot of extra refining capacity. the growth in the economy, and boom in trucks/suv\\'s has eatin up that excess capacity. Where bush is at fault is, he goes on tv pushing ethenol and prommising to reduce use of gasoline in the US by 20%. this makes it impossible for the oil companies to spend the billions of dollars necessary to expand capacity. It doesn\\'t make business sense to increace refining capacity when the government (headed by, and including Bush) is saying we will actually need less refining capacity in the future by lowering demand.  You\\'re right, Bush caved in to the wacko left on this, as he has done in other matters...but I dont want to start a political discussion.Let\\'s just say the all the people in D.C. are trying to tinker in a market where they don\\'t belong (screwing up free markets and screwing consumers & then having the hutzpah to blame the oil companies). [I am not in an oil related business and don\\'t own any oil stock, except for what is in the S&P 500 index.] But, these politicians, primarily on the left, make me crazy with their outlandish statements.  just chalk it up to the law of unintended consequences  I thought this was a great thread.

I can certainly understand choosing a more rare car than going with the flow, especially when the differences in them get more and more slim with each passing model-change.You mention your Focus wagon... I always admired those little cars. Great utility without the SUV mileage penalty. I sure wish Honda had more hatchbacks than just the Fit, that weren\\'t SUVs (although the CR-V certainly blurs the line between car and SUV). A Honda Accord Sport Wagon to compete with the Mazda 6 Wagon would be AWESOME to me, since I take a lot of road trips and am young enough that I really don\\'t need a soccer-mom Tahoe or Explorer, and never have a need for AWD (last snow in Birmingham, Alabama was in 2000!).  That\\'s where my factory ordered Mazda6 will be built. I was told they also build the Ford Mustang there. Have there been any recent problems wiht the Mustang? Press is very positive as to the 6.I owned a 2004 Mazda6 S that was built there and traded it for an \\'06 Mustang GT that was built there. The 6 needed a new intake manifold which was a fairly common problem wiht the first and second year models and was covered under warranty. I had it changed out during a routine oil change and it took them about an extra 15 minutes. A new one should not have the same problem.As for the Mustang, no common problems with that one. Some people have had minor problems here and there as you\\'ll see with every vehicle, but nothing major.Flat Rock is a very good and modern plant. You should have no worries.   Doh and I left off a big one - it must be a manual transmission with a foot operated clutch pedal. I don\\'t know if that is a \"top 10\" priority as much as a barrier to admission, if its not a stick, I am not even going to look.  I can certainly understand choosing a more rare car than going with the flow, especially when the differences in them get more and more slim with each passing model-change.Well stated. Very diplomatic. It was our gut feeling that there really were not a lot of differences in the mid-size sedan category, but that the Fusion had an edge in \"sportiness.\" Plus we are fortunate to have a really exceptional Ford, Lincoln, Mercury dealer in our berg and have had generally good experiences with FoMoCo products as a rule of thumb.You mention your Focus wagon... I always admired those little cars. Great utility without the SUV mileage penalty. I sure wish Honda had more hatchbacks than just the Fit, that weren\\'t SUVs (although the CR-V certainly blurs the line between car and SUV).The Focus wagon has been a great little utility vehicle, a mini SUV as it were. Unfortunately, Ford is doing away with all of its Focus hatchbacks and station wagons in 2008. The new Foci will only be available as a four-door or two-door sedan. If I were going to replace the Focus I\\'d probably go with the Honda Fit. That\\'s about the closest thing to it, especially in the price range. The only other option would be a bare bones utility pickup, like a Ford Ranger or Mazda, which is a see-same deal.The AWD option is not something I would have ordered. That\\'s how the car was equipped on the lot. It only snows once or twice a year in our section of Maryland. There is also a rather serious gas mileage penalty associated with AWD. Our V6 only manages 14.8 mpg in all-city driving after 3,200 miles, but will deliver 24-26 on road trips.Talk about ironies, we traded a 2000 Mazda Miata convertible in on the Fusion. The Miata, purchased new by my then 80-year-old Mother, only had 7,500 original miles on it. Mom only drove it to church on Sundays, to the grocery store, to the bank and to the beauty parlor.The Miata is definitely a true sports car, a ton of fun but not a very practical vehicle. We inherited it when Mom had an accident in it and I took away her driver\\'s license.I really had my heart set on a new Accord. The wife wanted a Mustang. We compromised on the Fusion, which is absolutely one of Ford\\'s better ideas in the last few years. The Fusion\\'s styling is definitely bold, out of the mainstream. That suits us but it might not be everyone\\'s cup of tea. To be sure, the Camry and Accord sit atop of the mid-size market segment, with good reason, I\\'m sure.  +1I forgot as well... maybe it fits under \"Driving Experience\"   We compromised on the Fusion, which is absolutely one of Ford\\'s better ideas in the last few years.

I wasn\\'t as concerned with the nameplate I was buying as I was the driving experience, and with our rough roads, the Accord has the best compromise of sport and comfort for my driving style.

That\\'s a very good list, Bender. It mirrors my own priorities though I might find room for a category named gadgets/special features.Part of my considerations were how many gadgets and accessories I could buy with the money I saved if I had bought one of the other cars I was considering. That\\'s not to say I \"settled.\" There were three cars I was willing to buy and it came down to which one I could get the best deal on. Each had their virtues and each had their negatives. , But when I realized my decision to buy the mazda6 for the price that was offered, I could also buy a plasma tv, DSLR, window tint, short shifter, and other miscellaneous items and still have money left over compared to the other choices, the decision became very easy.  Sounds like a good compromise. Great handling with a practical/reliable side to it too. I know a few people in this forum who would argue that the Accord and Camry float by on name aloneI doubt it too. Nameplate may get someone into the dealership for a test drive, but I doubt many people will spend 20-30k just bassed on name.  Adjustments will no doubt have to be made by the workers when switching from a Mustang to a 6. Can they do it without too many problems, is the question.I think you may have misunderstood his statement. The 6 is built side-by-side with the Mustang at the Flat Rock plant, and all 6 models sold in NA (excluding the MazdaSpeed6) are built there, since the 6 was introduced in \\'03.Having said that, my \\'04 has close to 50K miles, and has had no major issues or problems (besides a couple TSBs and a faulty gas cap).  \"But when I realized my decision to buy the mazda6 for the price that was offered, I could also buy a plasma tv, DSLR, window tint, short shifter, and other miscellaneous items and still have money left over compared to the other choices, the decision became very easy.\"You could also buy an Accent and put a down payment on a vacation home.Most people don\\'t budget $30K for a car, spend $20K and then take $10K and just spend it. While I\\'m glad you like the Mazda, it would not be my choice. I would gladly spend more to have the car I want and feel I got more in the process.  you do have to wonder when Ford\\'s relationship with the UAW as well as the other financial considerations will make it better for them to close Flat Rock and make the 6 along side the Fusion - in Mexico. Many parts/assemblies of the Mustang are made in Mexico as well. They have closed 14 plants in the last year or so and likely lead the pack in the category of large cos. putting Americans out of work!  Hermasillo does not have the capacity to build the three Fusion variants as well as the three 6 variants and the Mustang.AAI (Flat Rock) was just overhauled not too long ago and is a fully flexible manufacturing plant. I can\\'t imagine they will close it any time soon. If the Lincoln MKR ever gets the green light it would make sense to build it at AAI given it\\'s Mustang roots too.  If the Lincoln MKR ever gets the green light it would make sense to build it at AAI given it\\'s Mustang roots too.According to a Ford engineer the \"mustang\" part of the MKR and the Interceptor was all smoke and mirrors. Sounds like it will either use a D3 (Taurus) converted to RWD or share a new Aussie RWD platform.  I didn\\'t think you\\'d all really LISTEN to me when I said \"back to your regularly scheduled honda vs. ford thread\"i should have said \"everyone send me $100 to the following address...\"-thene btw - nissan is still the best! :P  think it may be the bean counters that might have their hearts/pocketboooks set on closing ALL US plants, understand that there currently is limited capacity down in Mexico, although they are also limiting production to some level closer to how many Fusions they can actually sell. It has got to be a helluva lot cheaper for Ford to build anything down there and easier in the respect that the \\'Indians aren\\'t dictating to the Chiefs\\'. Maybe enough to justify spending a part of that last $23 billion they borrowed to expand Mexican operations?I rag on Ford and the other \\'US\\' mfgrs. all the time about the damage they are doing by moving out - but the fact is that they are likely doing what they have to - to survive, although you have to wonder how those \\'Japanese\\' cos., for example, can make a fortune building what they do here.  The Japanese plants here are much newer and therefore more efficient, plus they get tax breaks from the local governments in exchange for the new jobs they create. Throw in the legacy costs and UAW overhead (jobs bank, e.g.) and it\\'s pretty clear that something needs to change in Detroit just to level the playing ground.    The Mazda6 is due for a redux this fall, yet there has been no formal unveiling of a new car. Does that mean there will be no new Mazda6 for the 2008 MY??I actually wouldn\\'t mind if the new 6 were delayed until the fall of 2008. That is when I\\'ll be buying my next new car, and I can just imagine the great deals that could be had on a \\'08 Mazda6 then, given what kind of deals are available today.  The Mazda6 is due for a redux this fall, yet there has been no formal unveiling of a new car. Does that mean there will be no new Mazda6 for the 2008 MY??The latest I heard from a different forum is that the redesigned 6 will be unveiled at the Frankfurt show, which is in late August. My opinion is that it\\'ll be an early \\'09, instead of \\'08.Other rumors:- The 2.3L 4-cyl will be bumped to 2.5L with a small power increase and better gas mileage.- The 3.0 Duratec will be replaced by a 3.7L version of the revised (3.5L) Duratec, modified by Mazda, of course.- Both engines are expected to have a 6-speed manual and 6-speed auto- AWD is still being rumored, although no specifics as to which engine or transmissionOf course, this can all change 5 minutes before introduction, so I guess we\\'ll have to wait and see...   Thanks! Although if it is intro\\'d in Frankfurt, it could still show up in the U.S. before the end of 2007. Still, \\'09 MY seems more likely.  The 3.0 Duratec will be replaced by a 3.7L version of the revised (3.5L) Duratec, modified by Mazda, of course.a unique perspective. TMK, even dating back into the 80s the V6s were always 100% Ford whereas the 4 bangers were of Mazda design. At least that is the way it was with a Probe I once owned. 3.5 production is already lagging as the new new Taurus is behind schedule.I think there are a lot of things that Ford announces plans to do and then runs out of money (and time) before they can do it. I would guess the 08 6 will still be plagued by the existing 3.0 DT and wait until Ford has a chance to \\'improve\\' it circa 09/10. I agree - wait and see.  - Both engines are expected to have a 6-speed manual and 6-speed auto mmm 6 speed stick...sounds delightful woot woot :P  The new Taurus is not behind schedule. Where do you guys get all this misinformation?  In response to ZZzoom6\\'s question, I ordered the Grand Touring 6i 5 door in early May. Dealer said it would take 6 weeks. I kind of doubted that but went ahead and ordered anyway. My instincts were right, as Mazda USA told me over the phone that the build date would not be until early July and and delivery mid to late August. She said it has to go to San Diego first and then to the Dealer here in northern california. (I don\\'t know what they do to it in San Diego.) There is one Grant Touring 6i 5 door in California right now, but it\\'s automatic. I wanted a manual. Hence the order....... Anyway I chose black leather, violet gray, satin fuel door, and wind deflector. So its loaded. BTW there are only a few \"touring\" 6i 5 door hatchbacks in California. Most are base models. I don\\'t get it. Such a nice car with decent mileage. There are a few more v6\\'s , but in my book well equipped 4cl\\'s are the future, given prices of gas to come. I think Hyundai\\'s strategy is smart--supposedly shipping lots 08 4cl Sonata\\'s with premium trim.  So would this put \"distinctive style\" and \"brand name\" at the top of your top 10? Over things like MPG. I wouldn\\'t say at the top of the list, but pretty high up. The revised EPA estimate for our V6 AWD Fusion is only 17 mpg city, 24 mpg highway, which is not good, but something we have to accept. Obviously, \"distinctive style\" is a bit higher on our list than MPG, as is the Ford brand name.  New spy shots (from April anyway) of the 2008 Mazda6. Notice that the next 6 is larger. Someone mentioned that it will get the 3.7L V6 but I\\'ve only heard of it getting the Mazdafied version of the 3.5L. The 2.5L I4 seems to be true too. I wonder if the 6 will get AWD as an option too?  The new Taurus is not behind schedule.They started hitting the lots last week. Ford said Spring of 2007 and it currently is Spring of 2007 by my calculations.  I think Hyundai\\'s strategy is smart--supposedly shipping lots 08 4cl Sonata\\'s with premium trim.This is what Honda has been doing for years, hence the Accord EX-L (and available with a manual transmission to boot!!), and the Fusion is available with a 4cyl and the SEL trim level.I wonder when the 4 cylinder from the Mazda6 will hit the Fusion.  Also I just read in the July MT that the 3.5L is expected, and the new Mazda6 is due out this fall.  There was a spy photo of it also that gives a pretty good front and side view, and shows the streamlined greenhouse as has been reported earlier.  You could also buy an Accent and put a down payment on a vacation home.Most people don\\'t budget $30K for a car, spend $20K and then take $10K and just spend it. While I\\'m glad you like the Mazda, it would not be my choice. I would gladly spend more to have the car I want and feel I got more in the process.That\\'s the thing though...I got exactly what I wanted for a lot less money than I originally budgeted for. I budgeted between 20 and 25k for my purchase and I knew that I wanted something pretty fun to drive, something that had a comfortable back seat, and preferrably had a good deal of hauling capability. After my test drives, I thought the Accord, Legacy GT, and Mazda6 would meet my needs, so the shopping began. Once I saw what I could get a Mazda6 for, I jumped at the chance. It\\'s been a great car that has exceeded my expectations. I\\'m sure I would have been happy with the other choices also, but looking back, I\\'m sure I would make the same choice today as I did over a year ago. And why the h*** would I want to buy an Accent? Just cuz it\\'s cheap? When I buy something, I want something that I actually want. Not something I buy and regret later and end up spending more for what I really wanted... I still had criteria that I was going to use so I made sure I got what I wanted; something reliable, fun, practical, and comfortable. And I ended up with something that looked good too! I\\'m just saying that saving on up-front costs was more than just a number; it was money that could be used to get a great tv, a good camera, a better shifter, a nicer looking car, and a great storage system for the hatchback. These were things that I was going to buy anyway, but knowing that I got all these things sooner while still staying under budget is a huge bonus.  Sorry to hear that you have to wait so long for your car... I know I\\'d be getting a bit anxious, especially every time I saw a 6 drive by on the road! I\\'m also a bit surprised that there aren\\'t more of those around, particularly with gas prices being what they are. I drove the four cylinder manual around and I almost got that instead of the v-6 I got. It definately has a bit less understeer going into a corner so it\\'s very fun to drive. Anyways, hope you get your car sooner rather than later... and if you have any ?s about your car, let me know.  And why the h*** would I want to buy an Accent? Just cuz it\\'s cheap? When I buy something, I want something that I actually want.I think his point was that you could put your savings on your car (the difference of the money budgeted vs the amount spent) in a savings or investment account or similar, not that you should have gotten a less expensive vehicle. He was saying the amount you had left over \"budgeted\" was about the cost of a Accent.  Yup, it\\'s crazy Mazda not having ample sixes configured with manual tranny 4cl\\'s with the higher trims. It\\'s what the market is demanding right now it seems.  the 3.5 in the 500 was originally promised as a 2007 model to be introduced in the fall of 2006. This set of promises pretty much from day one - perhaps an apology for putting the 200 hp version DT in a car that big in the first place and certainly that car\\'s \\'fatal\\' flaw). Never did make it. In the meanwhile, lets try giving it a new name and then even miss that date by a little better than a month (originally promised for last April), and I\\'m still not sure there are any out there you or I can actually drive - or more to the point put in your driveway. Pricing is, however out and I\\'m sure Ford would be very happy to take whatever deposit money you wish to leave behind for the next product that is too little too late. Misinformation? Ford needs to get some communication going between those bean counters controlling things and those salespeople that promise things - a problem in Dearborn for several years now.  That was a delay in development of the motor. Ford admittedly delayed it so they could make it more flexible for future applications. The Five Hundred wasn\\'t the only model to suffer from that delay. The Fusion may actually even be suffering from it to an extent today and for a couple of years to come because production capacity is increasing slowly. If they had started building that engine two years ago maybe the Fusion would have it by now.The Duratec30 in the Five Hundred and Freestyle are low in the HP range but do perform rather well due to their CVT transmissions. From a marketing standpoint though, you are right, it was a \"fatal\" flaw.   The 3.0L DuraTec V6 was a Porsche design (yes, that\\'s correct), not Ford. Porsche sold the design, including all engineering drawings, etc., to Ford.  Edmunds story.Now this I like! I\\'d much rather pay a small premium for a diesel engine than pay a HUGE premium for a hybrid that I know I\\'ll never make the cost up for. At least with the diesel I know I\\'ll make the extra cost up relatively quickly and not have to deal with the hybrid quirks.  Now this I like! I\\'d much rather pay a small premium for a diesel engine than pay a HUGE premium for a hybrid that I know I\\'ll never make the cost up for. At least with the diesel I know I\\'ll make the extra cost up relatively quickly and not have to deal with the hybrid quirks.I concur and other automakers are following suit - I believe Nissan is looking at a diesel as well. I wonder if GM still has any relationship with Isuzu (Chevette/Luv diesels back in the day were Isuzu designs).  I never saw April 07 as a target date. In January they said \"by summer\" and last time I checked Summer is still 17 days away.And I don\\'t think the 3.5 was ever promised as a 2007 model. Please provide a link.As baggs32 said the 3.5 was supposed to be ready for the Five Hundred debut but it was delayed. However I don\\'t think that it was ever promised for 2007.  I wonder if GM still has any relationship with Isuzu (Chevette/Luv diesels back in the day were Isuzu designs). I believe there is still an Isuzu branded copy of the Trailblazer and Colorado so I\\'d guess yes. However I don\\'t see GM putting a diesel in the Malibu or any other car they make in this class. IIRC the Mazda6 and Ford Modeo use a Ford or Mazda diesel in Europe so who knows there.  this is suprising given that Porsche would have very little use for a 60d V6 in any of their products for the last 40 or 50 years, those engines being the boxer opposed 6s etc. Can\\'t imagine that Porsche would have any reason to design something so rough and unrefined - maybe they gave up and found a willing \\'sucker\\' in Dearborn, or maybe that Ford made some of their patented cost cutting \\'improvements\\'. A cause for celebration in Fordland, though, now all these DT owners can claim an engine \\'designed by Porsche\\' even it if doesn\\'t sound or feel like one.  my source for this came from a Ford sales manager back in spring 2005, after I test drove the 500 - hated the drivetrain (naturally), and told him so. Again, what sales people (or public relations folks) will tell you is often what they think you want to hear and not necessarily related to Ford\\'s actual abilities to produce sufficient quantities to make promises come true. If it was, indeed, originally scheduled for the 500 debut back in 04/05, than I guess it is really about 3 years late, because you still can\\'t get it in the thinly disguised Taurus. It will be interesting to see if the same sort of thing doesn\\'t happen to the \\'reengineered\\' 240hp 3.0 that I guess is \\'scheduled\\' for debut in a 2010(?) Fusion. By then, it will be 10 years behind the Nissan VQ, 7 or 8 behind the Honda V6, and 5 behind the Toyota 2GR/Hyundai 3.3 and likely still not as good as any of them are today. Not to mention a solid 25 or 30hp (or more) - too little too late!  I concur and other automakers are following suit - I believe Nissan is looking at a diesel as wellin 2010 nissan will be making a maxima diesel available for sale in NA. But the other big advantage to the diesel is its longevity. you can put 300-400-500 thousand miles or more on one. Just drain the water separator and fuel filter every so often, and replace the fuel filter every 10k or so and it will run forever.  I guess you\\'ll believe anything if it backs up your hatred of Ford.  But the other big advantage to the diesel is its longevity. you can put 300-400-500 thousand miles or more on one.Yea but the engine, if properly maintained, isn\\'t the thing that\\'s gonna break first. More like transmissions, pumps, seals, timing chains, brakes etc. The seats, carpeting, accessories etc. all get ancient and crusty - who wants to be surrounded by that for many years? Not me. Kinda depressing. I like the new car thing.  I guess you\\'ll believe anything if it backs up your hatred of Ford.Ford has earned that emotion.   The seats, carpeting, accessories etc. all get ancient and crusty - who wants to be surrounded by that for many years? Not me. Kinda depressing.I like the new car thing.Wow, I want your salary   The 924, 944, and 928 did not use boxer engines. Of course, some may argue these are not \"real Porsches,\" but you should drive a V8-powered 928 before that statement is made.However, you are probably correct in Ford\\'s applied value-engineering. It may have been something totally different in the hands of Porsche. It is a rough-sounding engine, but once you look at the block, and underside design, of the engine, it\\'s apparent the design didn\\'t originate in Dearborn. The bottom end - externally - looks very European. Here\\'s a copy-and-paste from WikiPedia on the DuraTec engine:\"The 2.5 L and 3.0 L V6 Duratecs are evolutions of the same design, first used in the 1994 Ford Mondeo. It is a modern aluminum DOHC V6 with a 60° bank angle. The primary engineering input came from Porsche, who were developing a similar V6 before selling the engineering to Ford, and Cosworth, who helped with cylinder head manufacturing.The Jaguar AJ-V6 engine is similar but adds variable valve timing. Mazda\\'s AJ version also has this feature.\"Porsche and Cosworth (Mike Costin/Keith Duckworth) - not a bad lineage, even though the execution may not be to one\\'s liking.  \"You took the words out of my mouth Elroy.

It seems like you are resentful of having a Ford by making comments like that.Why do it?  and that \\'hatred\\' might be a little strong. I have 2 big problems with Ford - 1) the historical fact that they have no ability to make a good smaller engine and 2) their current policies literally paying quite a number (thousands and thousands) of their employees not to work, the economic impact of which is, I guess, yet to be determined although I feel confident in saying that the upper midwestern states are generally hurting right now. What hurts those folks in Michigan, whether it be declining tax bases, swelling unemployment/welfare roles etc etc. MUST eventually hurt the rest of us as well. Their cars are, however, improving - finally - albeit with some rather ancient technologies. It is a fact that as go the (what used to be) Big 3, so goes the country. It is better for all of us that Ford, if it can continue to mfgr. in this country, if it sells a bunch of whatever they attempt to sell and if it makes a good solid profit doing it, does well. A helluva lot of \\'ifs\\'. Wish them luck actually, they will need it, because none of these things are happening now or are they likely to happen in the forseeable future. In which case, this great country of ours will be facing the biggest business failure in history.to get back on this thread though, I\\'d hate to see truly good \\'niche\\' cars like the Mazda 3/6s (blown 4 bangers notwithstanding), go down with the ship. My prediction - by 2010 or 12 Mazda will be sold off in a last ditch effort by its parent company to stay afloat and a few years later will become again the innovative and independent company (Toyo Koygo(?)) they once were.  the historical fact that they (Ford) have no ability to make a good smaller engine...Depends on your definition of \"good\" I guess. The 2.5L in the Contour SVT, the 170hp 4-cyl in the Focus SVT, and the 3.4L from the last SHO Taurus come to mind as \"better than average\" engines (for their time).  \" I know a few people in this forum who would argue that the Accord and Camry float by on name alone\"That\\'d be me your waving the wacking stick at AGAIN.

Saying you don\\'t like the car is perfectly valid. I didn\\'t pick up a Consumer Reports before getting my Honda, so that alone makes \"seeing past it\" quite difficult. I DROVE the car, and compared it with other cars I DROVE.

By all means go get the less expensive midsizer like Fusion and Sonata. Since in this case he/she would just be paying more for absolutely nothing.

THANK YOU for that very clear post. It drives the point home to EVERYONE.  \"I wonder when the 4 cylinder from the Mazda6 will hit the Fusion.\"It would bode well for Ford to put the 2.5 in the Fusion/Milan and have at least 175HP mated to a 6speed auto/manual box.

Oh yeah, it slipped my mind that the 3.4 was a Yamaha... Sorry. :blush:  The Jag version is also high compression, and, has a triple level induction system. In the S Type the 3.0 delivers 236 HP.

Backy is someone who didn\\'t get a Honda and bought a Hyundai (IIRC) because it offered a better value to him. In truth, the reason I didn\\'t even consider Honda the last time I bought a new car was not because they did not offer a good value. It was because they didn\\'t offer a car, period (of the type I was looking for at the time). I\\'ve owned Hondas, loved them, and would buy a Honda in a second if it offered me what I was looking for, at the right price.

Think it\\'s time for a new 6, the old one is getting a bit baroque. Mazda has one of the worst brand loyalties. Probably because the 3 is a better car than the 6. When they\\'re ready to move up they move to a similar, more expensive car with the same traits in an upscale marque.  oh come on now, by your own jaundiced view, the DT3.0 must have been just the right engine for the 500. It was so \\'right\\' in fact that Ford, needed to discontinue it after a whole 3 model years, put a razor blade grin on it, add 60 apparently smoother and quieter HP, and give it a new name. If it wasn\\'t the engine than what killed the car? Must be the lack of razor blades, because otherwise I thought the car was a quite well designed. Kinda like the Fusion, both cars well conceived AND in need of heart transplants.  So, basically, you found something to suit your needs, right?

It lends MUCH more credibility to an argument when there is a source. Maybe that\\'s why it is a requirement to cite your sources when writing anything of value that is scholastic in nature.  I think I\\'ll come back when this forum is all about midsize sedans again. Good night everyone.   source: Consumer Reports an article entitled \\'what is an American car - 2 Toyota models (the Camry and Avalon) have significantly more than the Mustang\\'s 60% American made parts content. Read it and weep, or dismiss it as some Ford \\'bashing\\' on CRs part, if you wish. I couldn\\'t bring myself to believe it at first either - that bastion of Americana the Mustang of all things.I believe if you research this a little though you will find a good piece of that offending 40% is under the hoods..   It would bode well for Ford to put the 2.5 in the Fusion/Milan and have at least 175HP mated to a 6speed auto/manual box. I don\\'t see this happening, if at all until 09 model upgrade.Not auto/manual...a real manual with a foot operated clutch pedal and something that sticks up between the seats where you manually select the gear desired.  scape, this is from your own postIt would bode well for Ford to put the 2.5 in the Fusion/Milan and have at least 175HP mated to a 6speed auto/manual box. I don\\'t see this happening, if at all until 09 model upgrade.You have also said that the Fusion should have the 3.5L engine, instead of the 3.0L. If they do use the 2.5 and the 3.5 liter engines in 09 it will be a generation too late. Why were these engines not used to begin with? Other sedans in this segment have been using higher powered engines for years now. The Fusion is a generation behind. Buying a current generation Fusion is like buying the last generation of most other midsize sedans. The Fusion is still 4 to 5 years behind the competition, IMO.  my problem with this is the same HP/lb. (1:20) ratio that would yield (let\\'s be kind) - non-competitive acceleration capabilities, keeping in mind that some of these better engines today can and do deliver both power and economy. Taking 3 steps back like this and going back even further to an early 90s engine, is not going to help FE and would kill power of course - buyers these days want BOTH. Hell, the Altima 4 banger will hit that 175HP and leave that old Contour 100 miles behind before the first gas stop. Technology, I believe, is the answer to better more efficient engines, not simply reducing their size.  The Fusion is still 4 to 5 years behind the competition, IMO. The transmission is way behind too. What a huge oversight. Even the base Kia Optima has a Sportmatic shifter. The top of the line Fusion doesn\\'t. Just D or L.  The Accord doesn\\'t have a manumatic either. I\\'ve never longed for one, I just use the D3, 2, or 1 when I have ever needed to lower the gears manually.  So, I guess since the Accord doesn\\'t offer AWD or a six speed automatic its also now behind the Fusion/Milan??? :confuse:  \"Taking 3 steps back like this and going back even further to an early 90s engine, is not going to help FE and would kill power of course - buyers these days want BOTH.

It stated that the Honda Accord was the \"Top Pick\" in its category. So, what do we believe? Hyundai is equal to Honda and Honda Accord is the Top Pick?Sounds reasonable to me, since the Accord was my Top Pick too, and Hyundai has been known to be improving for several years now.I guess you\\'ll ignore this post too though, just like the ones asking you to point out my bashing of Ford. Oh well.  Who in this forum would consider a diesel version of their current car, if the price difference was less than $1,500 and the fuel economy jumped by 30 % or more? More torque and less top end power.Anyone?  Why are you quoting an article from 2003? It isn\\'t relevant in 2007.The great thing about these forums is that one can debate the pros and cons of these cars. At the end of the day, I buy the car I feel most comfortable with. In my book Honda and Toyota lead the segment lead the segment overall. Ford has a lot of catching up to do. In the late 80s/early 90s a family sedan=Ford, not any more. I think Ford offers real value, but a few bucks more one gets into a better class of car.  Good topic. I for one would certainly consider a diesel Accord. Judging by the recent Edmunds report posted earlier, a diesel will be available in the next generation Accord, and I can\\'t wait to test drive it. I also think a full comparison test (price, driving experience, real-world MPG, etc.) between the upcoming Accord diesel and the Camry or Altima hybrids (both Prius technology) will make a great read. I passed on the Hybrid Camry mainly because of the price premium (among other reasons).  Who in this forum would consider a diesel version of their current car, if the price difference was less than $1,500 and the fuel economy jumped by 30 % or more? More torque and less top end power.SIGN ME UP  :shades:  I think Ford offers real value, but a few bucks more one gets into a better class of car.Exactly. I\\'ll add Hyundai to that statement.Plus if scape bothered to check, sales of Hyundai in 2007 are way off. The Sonata sold about 10,000 units last month. Good car, but 10,000 units? That\\'s hardly a movement.  beng one of those consumers that somehow doesn\\'t \\'see thru all the CR\\' - it is somewhat interesting to note that Sonata reliability ratings have fallen off in those 4 years since that article. Understandable, IMO in that it was a totally new car in 05. The Fusion been around less time, the jury must be regarded as \\'still out\\', but it may hold its rather lofty position from a reliability standpoint in that in most respects it was not a truly new car at introduction. There are some advantages to using old engines/trannies and established chassis designs etc.. Ford would be doing a lot better if it could approach Hyundai\\'s current product line.  I like the idea, but I\\'d have to reserve final judgement until I had a chance to drive it and have at least a couple years to see how it holds up. I tend not to be an early adopter since unanticipated issues often come up even though Honda has done a pretty good job with their new products in the recent past. But I think a diesel would suit my current commute well(short, in city driving). On the other hand, I don\\'t think my criteria for choosing a car would change; a 20% increase in fuel mileage would only save me $6 a week at the most. So that means it would take me 4 years to recoup the extra expense, assuming diesel costs 20% less per gallon. Since I probably will keep my car for 6+ years, it may make sense to go this route if driving dynamics and reliability are still good. But those are big \"if\\'s\" and wouldn\\'t buy into it until there was some good data showing it holds up.  Grad\" If one can\\'t see the reason to pay the premium for Accord/Camry/Altima then one shouldn\\'t. By all means go get the less expensive midsizer like Fusion and Sonata. Since in this case he/she would just be paying more for absolutely nothing.

Scape2Ya see.. you say \"less expensive\" Some in this room read this as \"cheaper\" or \"cheap\". Thus these sedans are viewed as less than a \"premium sedan\". I have avoided this till now, but could not contain myself any longer.Let me get this straight.One person says one of the main advantages of the Fusion is its lower price, and that people are wasting money on a more expensive vehicle. This same person then uses an example of the Fusion being less expensive as an instance of Ford Bashing. :confuse: :confuse: :confuse: :confuse: So is being less expensive a good thing or a bad thing, or does it just depend?I (like many Accord buyers) also looked at the Fusion. The main reason we choose the Accord was that the back seat was quite a bit roomier, the fuel mileage was better, and the safety was better. If Ford had a magic bullet - like a station wagon, or a diesel engine, then things might have been different. No animosity towards Ford.  RE: Fusion being less expensive...While browsing at one of our neighborhood Ford motherships this weekend, I noticed that quite a few Fusions on the lot did not have ABS, which is a $600 option from Ford.I can\\'t imagine anyone would NOT want ABS on their midsize sedan. And if Ford was looking for ways to make sure the published \"base\" prices would be less than the competition, I don\\'t know that leaving ABS as optional was a good choice. It certainly doesn\\'t help their safety image IMO.At least they added some structural reinforcements starting Jan 2007 to help try and get the frontal crash test results in line with the competition... but without ABS, Fusion drivers are more likely to experience a frontal crash than the competition.$600... that is 1/3 of the price difference between a Fusion S and my Accord LX right there (the Accord has standard ABS).  That is another reason I prefer the Milan over the Fusion--ABS is standard, and I think a power driver\\'s seat also. And it doesn\\'t have the Gilette grille and passe clear taillamps.  I\\'ve seen Milans (no options) advertised in my town for around $15k. Very good deal IMO.  Some people really don\\'t want ABS given a choice. For 08 ABS will be standard on all Fusions so it will be a moot point anyway.  I can\\'t imagine anyone would NOT want ABS on their midsize sedan. And if Ford was looking for ways to make sure the published \"base\" prices would be less than the competition, I don\\'t know that leaving ABS as optional was a good choice. It certainly doesn\\'t help their safety image IMO.I concur, this was one of the reasons I didn\\'t see a lot of value in the new Altima. The base model is very close to 20k which is a lot of $$$ to not have some basic safety features.  \"years to come because production capacity is increasing slowly. \" Wrong.. Hermi plant is at capacity.. Scape, read the posts before making comments please. My statement you quoted was clearly referring to Duratec35 production. That motor is not mfd at Hermosillo.Good grief. :sick: I said the \"fatal flaw\" was that they didn\\'t market the car right not the engine\\'s power. Good griefe X 2. :sick: :sick:  that bastion of Americana the Mustang of all things.I believe if you research this a little though you will find a good piece of that offending 40% is under the hoods.. Did they specify the engine? The V6 in the Mustang, Ranger, and Explorer are build in Cologne, Germany and have been for years. The V8 is built in two places, one of them being Windsor, Ontario Canada and the other is Romeo Michigan. IIRC the Windsor goes in the trucks and the Romeo goes in the Mustang. The parts content sticker was removed from my GT so I don\\'t know if it differed from the numbers you posted.IIRC the Fusion\\'s U.S. parts content is very low too.  Having read this forum for several months now, I just don\\'t get all of emphasis on 0-60 times. Why is it so important? Do we have a bunch of teenage drag racers on this forum or what?Our 2007 3.0-liter V6 SEL AWD Fusion may not be a rocket but it certainly does have adequate pickup and passing ability. The fact that FoMoCo\\'s 3.0 V6 is not as \"fast\" as a Honda V6, or a Toyota V6, or a Nissan V6, means nothing to me. Does that make me an old fuddy duddy?In real life, just how important (unimportant?) are 0-60 times? I just don\\'t believe it is that big of a deal. The 3.0 may not be as sophisticated (new?) as some of the other power plants in the mid-size segment but it is certainly not an antiquated mil by any means. I mean, gee whiz, GM is still using push rod V8 engines.The other thing that bugs me is how some Camcord owners have this holier than thou attitude. Sure, Accords and Camrys are good cars but so are the Fusions and Sonatas. I see the mid-size sedan category as being the most competitive one in the marketplace today, with there being very little difference between the makes and models. Am I naive? Is there one car that is head and shoulders above the competition?OK, the Camry and Accord sell the most, by a large margin. Is it because they are clearly superior or is it because they are perceived to be? McDonald\\'s sells more hamburgers than anyone else. Are they the best hamburgers, all being approximately the same price?We truly enjoy our $27,105 MSRP Fusion. The fit and finish on ours is perfect in every way. We see no room for improvement in that department.We really admire the styling and the handling is superb. We\\'re amazed that more people are not buying the Fusion. I guess it just takes a while for the word to get out.  Having read this forum for several months now, I just don\\'t get all of emphasis on 0-60 times. Why is it so important? Do we have a bunch of teenage drag racers on this forum or what? My biggest complaint with all of this has always been seen in the ratios (which I\\'ve seen around here but don\\'t know exactly how to link to them) of who buys what. According to what I\\'ve seen the vast majority of Camrys and Accords sold are equipped with an I4 and an ATX. The majority, although not quite as vast as that of the CamCord\\'s, of Fusions sold are equipped with a V6 (ATX is the only option there). Don\\'t know what it is for the Sonata.Knowing this I can\\'t see how the size or power numbers of the V6 options in the CamCords sell the cars. I understand that their I4s are superior in pretty much every way to those of the Fusion and Sonata and have no argument as to why people buy them in insane numbers. So why put the Fusion down for its V6 when in all reality it is selling better than the other V6 options? The odds are in favor of the Fusion at the stoplight going by the numbers.I see the Fusion as a good compromise if you don\\'t want an I4 and also don\\'t want to pay the premium the models with the larger V6 options. The Fusion is never going to sell as well as the Camry or Accord without a better I4 but it\\'s hard to argue that it doesn\\'t offer a lot of value in it\\'s current form. If things continue to pick up at Ford then you may see a more competitive Fusion in the future which would also entail another plant to mfr them which I don\\'t believe could even be possible right now.Now that I think about it, putting a Grand Slam mid-sized sedan out there would have actually been a mistake for Ford at this point IMO. If the Fusion were a GS and since they could only build, say, half of what shoppers demanded in the Hermosillo plant, then the shoppers in this class wouldn\\'t wait for one but rather go elsewhere because the other options are so strong too. I know that sounds crazy but if you think about it...   dudleyr, I have an \\'05 Sonata and find nothing offensive with the words \"less expensive.\" In fact, I\\'m quite happy with the car and its features (Special Value GLS) and tell people how relatively inexpensive it is. It was certainly less expensive than a comparably equipped Camry or Accord. I view that as a \"plus.\" Afterall, people shop between dealers for the same make & model. Why,...because they are hoping to find a deal that is \"less expensive.\"My Sonata hasn\\'t required a single trip to the dealer for anything to be corrected or fixed. I opted to go a dealer for three oil changes, but they could have just as easily been done at the nearby gas station. I have been so impressed with the \\'05 Sonata after 2 years and close to 15,000 miles, that we bought an \\'07 Sonata SE as our second company car a little over three months ago. We could have paid a lot more for a lot less car.  \"Some people really don\\'t want ABS given a choice. For 08 ABS will be standard on all Fusions so it will be a moot point anyway.\"What are some reasons why someone would not want to have ABS given the choice? The only thing I can think of would be cost, but after ABS has saved my butt countless times I think it is a small price to pay.I wonder if Ford will raise the base price to cover the cost of the ABS option after they make it standard.  The Accord doesn\\'t have a manumatic either. I\\'ve never longed for one, I just use the D3, 2, or 1 when I have ever needed to lower the gears manually. The Accord may not have a Sportshift but its got 4 forward gears not 2 like the Fusion. You\\'re using your gears like a Sportshift grad. You can\\'t do that in a Fusion. I use it often in my TL and would use it as often in any other car I owned. I like that feature and benefit from its availability.  I didn\\'t say it was reasonable or justified, but it\\'s reality. Some people think ABS actually hinders straight line braking on dry roads and others don\\'t want the added cost regardless of the safety benefits. Some people would probably eschew seatbelts if they could save a few bucks.  The Mazda Club Chat is on tonight. The chat room opens at 8:45PM ET Hope to see YOU there! Check out the schedule  The Accord may not have a Sportshift but its got 4 forward gears not 2 like the Fusion.What you meant to say, I believe, is that the Accord has four gearshift options while the Fusion only has two (Drive and Low). The V6 Fusion automatic actually has six (6) \"gears/speeds.\"I can count on my fingers and toes the number of times that I\\'ve ever used \"2\" and \"L\" in our other automatic transmission cars. I\\'d venture to say that 95 percent of the automatic drivers out there simply use \"D\" 95 percent of the time.Manualmatics are more gimmick than anything else, but I\\'ll concede that they do give the driver more options.  \"My biggest complaint... the ratios.. of who buys what.. vast majority of Camrys and Accords sold are equipped with an I4 and an ATX.

Perhaps dealers could have sold Fusions for close to MSRP for a while longer than they were able to. Also, it would have been great PR for Ford to have demand out-pace supply. Think 2005 Mustang, on a much larger scale!  Also, it would have been great PR for Ford to have demand out-pace supply.That\\'s a position every manufacturer would love to have, not just Ford.  Good post.

If they can really make the car great, which is probably possible in the next year or two, and find the plant capacity to produce the numbers they\\'ll need, think Taurus from \\'85 to the mid-90s, then we might see a Fusion that has what everyone hoped for in this iteration of the Fusion.

All of you know where the debate about the manufacturers belong and it\\'s not here.As I said just a few minutes ago, those who will not stay on topic are going to have their posting privileges removed.Some recent posts have been deleted.  I don\\'t have a very high regard for manu-matics, especially the ones that still use a torque converter, that is just silliness as far as I am concerned. If you want to shift, get a stick, if you want to feel like a boy racer with a slushbox, have at it. I did try to like the manu-matics once and even tried one out. It didn\\'t take long to decide that it wasn\\'t for me. The one I tried was in an \\'04 Mazda6 V6 and it was entirely too controlling in that it shifted too early and didn\\'t always like to shift when I wanted it too. All I wanted to do was get some engine braking going while going down a hill, a common practice in the snow around here if you have an MTX, and the goofy thing wouldn\\'t let me!  all of the Nissan Altima owners? Not a single review yet? Doesn\\'t anyone on this thread own an Altima? Guess not or they would have rated it, huh?  If I had a manumatic, I likely wouldn\\'t use it unless I wanted to hold a gear for climbing/braking in hilly areas. It wouldn\\'t be something I used in daily commuting. It would just be a more convenient version of what I already have (D, D3, 2, 1).  \"...(Where are) all the Altima owners?\"Well, maybe the Altima is just so much fun to drive, the owners are all out driving!   The seats, carpeting, accessories etc. all get ancient and crusty - who wants to be surrounded by that for many years? Not me. Kinda depressing. I didn\\'t mean keep it forever. Rather, it makes a tremendous commuter car.  all of the Nissan Altima owners? Not a single review yet? Doesn\\'t anyone on this thread own an Altima? Guess not or they would have rated it, huh? For some reason they keep getting deleted. There were over a hundred, then they were gone. then somebody else did a review, and now its gone too.  The seats, carpeting, accessories etc. all get ancient and crusty - who wants to be surrounded by that for many years? Not me. Kinda depressing. If you take care of the car with some regular interior cleaning (i don\\'t mean weekly or anything), it doesn\\'t get \"crusty.\" See more Car Pictures at CarSpace.comThis is my Accord, when it was about 10 years old (last year) with 160k miles or so on it. My grandmother never took care of it (the carpet was stained, the switchgear covered in makeup, french fries under the seat). After one afternoon of work, I had a clean example of a 10 year old car. It looks like a car half its age, if you ask me. It\\'s got one nasty scuff on the glovebox (visible as white in the picture). Other than that, it looks just fine and not at all \"ancient and crusty.\" Just getting a little dated now.  It would just be a more convenient version of what I already have (D, D3, 2, 1). Exactly. So you essentially have one. In my 02 Accord I was in D3 a lot for that slight braking and quicker pickup and 2 for the stop and go, bumper to bumper BS on the Atlanta Perimeter/GA 400 crawl without constantly riding the brake.I can\\'t imagine driving an auto without being able to use these features.  You must not do much stop and crawl, city traffic. Putting up with it everyday is tough enough. Doing it with a manual transmission would be torture.My weekend truck (06 Frontier) has a stick shift. It\\'s OK for for that purpose. Not really \\'fun\\' but not so bad. But again - everyday commuting with that? Na.  I did try to like the manu-matics once and even tried one out. It didn\\'t take long to decide that it wasn\\'t for me. The one I tried was in an \\'04 Mazda6 V6 and it was entirely too controlling in that it shifted too early and didn\\'t always like to shift when I wanted it too.I think I tried the Mazda manumatic also, and just felt it wasn\\'t anywhere near as responsive as a good manual transmission. All I remember about it though is that it didn\\'t leave a very memorable impression...which probably means I didn\\'t like it much. I spent a few days with the Sonata, which had the manumatic, and I really did not like that one at all; downshifts took way too long. By the time it downshifted, I was into the corner already! Even when I got more used to the timing, it just seemed to take too long. On the other hand, the Legacy, if I remember correctly - my drive in that was over a year ago, I thought was pretty good. But then again, that is a pretty powerful engine in the GT version so maybe my impression of the manumatic was colored by my infatuation with their powerplant. I\\'m glad I tried them... but if you want control over the power of the engine, manuals are the way to go. Even with stop and go traffic, I don\\'t mind. One thing about the 6 is that first gear is perfect for just puttering along, something that I can\\'t say about my old accord (perhaps hondas have changed, but my 96 in traffic was more of a chore).  Damn grad, I thought I took good care of my cars till I saw that. Please tell me those floor mats arn\\'t original.  Bingo! Its no secret that %99 of drivers use \"D\", \"R\",and \"P\" and thats it! Its all about just being able to say \"I have manushift\" \" I have a 260HP V6.. image once again... It is image, in the same way as saying \"I have AWD\" here in the south where it is pretty useless 99% of the time(especially the type in the Fusion and other typically front-drive only vehicles like Honda CR-V, etc...). In hilly segments around my county (Jefferson County, AL for reference), being able to lock in third gear or lower is a very welcome setting in my car. AWD would be useless to me. In flat Nebraska, D3 would be more useless and AWD more useful (more snow), a complete turnaround. These features each have their purpose, but the climate and topography often dictate their usefulness.   They are original. You can\\'t really see the brown \"tint\" to the grey mats, but they aren\\'t perfect. Close, but not perfect at all. The driver mat is also worn down in the usual spot where the heel of my foot rests.That post in itself was a very kind complement, thank you!(I worked my butt off getting them clean!)  http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-accord5jun05,0,4558762.story?track=mostviewed-storylevelToo expensive for very little extra mpgOkHonda is supposed to be working on a dedicated hybrid to compete directly with Prius. All I ask is that it not be ugly, like the Prius. I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder but......  All I ask is that it not be ugly, like the Prius. I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder but......The Prius is indeed one homely-looking vehicle, almost Aztek ugly, so strange that it is beautiful in its own way (the fabulous mileage makes it \"pretty.\") Every time I see one I know that the owner is laughing while he/she passes a gas station while I, on the other hand, cry.  The name just didn\\'t make sense to me. V6 Hybrid. People who want a hybrid are looking for GREAT MILEAGE, not mediocre mileage, at a premium price. Honda likes to do things different, but the V6 hybrid was a bad idea. I think an Accord diesel will make up for it though, if it\\'s not too expensive that is.  If you take care of the car with some regular interior cleaning (i don\\'t mean weekly or anything), it doesn\\'t get \"crusty.\" After seeing that grad, I don\\'t feel alone in the world anymore. :blush: My wife drives coworkers around from time to time and they all comment on how clean I keep our vehicles. One went so far as to ask if we hire a professional cleaner or use a cleaning service! I\\'d imagine you would get the same reaction.  It\\'s not all that hard to do really and the results are very satisfying IMO.I\\'d really hate to see the interiors of her coworkers vehicles. :surprise: :surprise:  When you keep your car clean, and everything working like it\\'s supposed to, it makes all the difference at resale time. I got $1000 over kbb for my 12 year old car, because it still looked great, and everything still worked like it should.   My biggest complaint with all of this has always been seen in the ratios (which I\\'ve seen around here but don\\'t know exactly how to link to them) of who buys what. According to what I\\'ve seen the vast majority of Camrys and Accords sold are equipped with an I4 and an ATX. The majority, although not quite as vast as that of the CamCord\\'s, of Fusions sold are equipped with a V6 (ATX is the only option there). Don\\'t know what it is for the Sonata. Knowing this I can\\'t see how the size or power numbers of the V6 options in the CamCords sell the cars. I understand that their I4s are superior in pretty much every way to those of the Fusion and Sonata and have no argument as to why people buy them in insane numbers. So why put the Fusion down for its V6 when in all reality it is selling better than the other V6 options? The odds are in favor of the Fusion at the stoplight going by the numbers. baggs32, It\\'s not the power of the V6 engines that sell I4 Camcords. What you have failed to mention is FUEL MILEAGE. The I4 Camcords sell so well because they have V6 power (or close to it) and get much better fuel mileage than a Fusion V6 does. While the V6 Fusion may win from the stoplight (by a small margin), it will also be the first to pull into the gas station (by a wide margin).Of course, this leads the Fusion V6 owner to say \"My V6 Fusion will leave your I4 Camcord in the dust\". Which invariably leads Camcord owners to post Camcord V6 performance numbers. Not saying it makes sense, just saying that\\'s the way it is.I don\\'t have a problem with anyone buying the car \"They\" want. We all have our \"Own\" reasons. Just don\\'t tell me I wasted thousands of $$ because I bought a Camcord. I bought a V6 Accord because it\\'s what \"I\" wanted. Telling me I bought the wrong car, is like telling the Pope he picked the wrong religion.   Just don\\'t tell me I wasted thousands of $$ because I bought a Camcord.My issue arises when others assert the competitors offer the SAME attributes of an Accord for thousands less. Some come close to the total package, but close is just that. Close. These others are priced less cause if priced the same as an Accord they\\'re sales numbers would be hammered.I\\'m confident the 08 Accord will only add to its separation from the pack.  When you keep your car clean, and everything working like it\\'s supposed to, it makes all the difference at resale time. I got $1000 over kbb for my 12 year old car, because it still looked great, and everything still worked like it should. Yeah I maintain things to a very high level, I would be willing to drive across the country in that car (or anywhere else). I like to keep the inside pretty spotless and keep these little wipes in the car for spills and stuff. I have cheated and had the car detailed a couple of times, but if I am going to spend that much time in that environment, I want it to be clean.  If you take care of the car with some regular interior cleaning (i don\\'t mean weekly or anything), it doesn\\'t get \"crusty.\" After seeing that grad, I don\\'t feel alone in the world anymore. Haha, if you think YOU get funny looks, try being a college student, not even 20 years old, and keeping a car really clean inside. All but my closest friends probably think I\\'m obsessive compulsive.I\\'ll share a big secret though. I wear flip-flops pretty often (when I\\'m not going to work), and to drive, I go barefoot (sliding my shoes under the seat). I don\\'t wanna go barefoot on nasty carpet!I have never had my car \"detailed,\" and in 12 years, I can say with confidence that I\\'m the only one who has EVER cleaned that car (my grandmother did nothing to it, I used to clean it up every year or so to make money as a younger kid). This isn\\'t reflected in the pictures, but I more recently used our upright Bissel Steam Carpet Cleaner on the floormats. You\\'d be amazed at the difference that made in how the car looked and even how it smelled (it didn\\'t stink previously, but boy did it smell great after a carpet cleaning!). If you have one of these carpet cleaners, I recommend using it on your floormats if your car is more than a few years old. It\\'ll really cut down on allergens and dirt in your car, even that that you cannot see.  My issue arises when others assert the competitors offer the SAME attributes of an Accord for thousands less. Some come close to the total package, but close is just that. Close.patronizing statements like this are why some people think camcord owners are elitist. and if the accord was \"the total package\" why do they have to come out with another package in 08 LOL?  I\\'ll restate my version what he said since we don\\'t completely disagree, hopefully in more diplomatic fashion.All of these competitors offer the same general features, at varying prices. The differences come in the presentation of all of it as a whole. How does the interior design feel; upscale or sporty? Boring but solid?How does the car drive; is it soft and buttery, sporty and rough, or somewhere in between?How are all the features of the car integrated together; does it come together as a cohesive unit?It is in these ways that the cars start to differentiate themselves, and it is basically personal preference. I found the Fusion to be too rough riding and the interior dated looking, the Sonata was numb/boring and had ergonomic quirks in the center stack that turned me off, and the Toyota was too soft and quiet, and not in the least bit engaging. They were all in the $20k-$24k range, all had between 155 and 166 horsepower, all offered automatics and 16\" wheels, and adequate interior space. It is the subtleties that won me over in the Accord; it had the right balance of features, a balance that was worth over a thousand dollars in order not to \"settle\" for something that didn\\'t exactly fit my wants and needs.and if the accord was \"the total package\" why do they have to come out with another package in 08 LOL? For the same reason that all car companies improve their cars; the bar is always being raised. The same reason people are speculating over the Fusion getting a 3.5L, the reason the Altima got a power bump, and the reason that the Malibu made a 240 hp engine (Malibu SS) optional. You\\'ve got to keep up with the competition!   Haha, if you think YOU get funny looks, try being a college student, not even 20 years old, and keeping a car really clean inside.I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old. You college students are squeaky clean compared to them! :P  It\\'s not the power of the V6 engines that sell I4 Camcords. What you have failed to mention is FUEL MILEAGE. The I4 Camcords sell so well because they have V6 power (or close to it) and get much better fuel mileage than a Fusion V6 does.I did say that in a round about way when I stated that the I4s of the Camry and Accord are superior to those in the Fusion and Sonata in nearly every way. The Fusion seems to fill a gap that no one else covers. V6 power for not much more cash than the other I4 offerings. You do lose some efficiency, but again, it is a compromise. Obviously it\\'s not a compromise everyone is willing to make but the Fusion does sell well so Ford got something right somewhere.While the V6 Fusion may win from the stoplight (by a small margin)I\\'ve already shown that the difference is more than most think. The numbers for the I4 Accord that have been posted around here, which are pretty close to the Fusion\\'s V6 numbers, were for one with an MTX. The I4 and ATX Accord are a good bit slower, close to a second IIRC. We just had a discussion about why anyone would want an MTX in a sedan so I\\'m guessing, and the sales numbers back me up, that stoplight matches between a V6 Fusion and MTX equipped I4 Accord are few and far between too.If the Fusion were available with an MTX then I\\'d expect to see mid to high 6 sec 0-60 times because that\\'s what the Mazda6 accomplishes with an MTX and similar motor. Compare that to an MTX I4 Accord and the difference is around a full second again. So this brings me back to my original statement that the Fusion V6 is a good compromise if you want V6 power but don\\'t want to pay the premium for the extra power of the Accord and Camry. With the Fusion you can get a V6 for a touch more than the I4 of the others which can be appealing all other attributes aside.In all honesty I\\'d only consider the Altima and Mazda6 in this category if I were in the market right now. They are the only two that offer an MTX with the V6, the performance I come to expect from such a drivetrain, and are visually appealing to me inside and out. I really don\\'t like the Accord\\'s or the Camry\\'s outward appearance right now and the Fusion, said Camry, and Sonata don\\'t offer an MTX with the V6 putting them all out of the running. Plus I did own a Mazda6 V6 previously and loved it making anything less too much of a compromise for me.   Just don\\'t tell me I wasted thousands of $$ because I bought a Camcord.exactly - because the fact of the matter is that elroy5 very likely DIDN\\'T. Many autobuyers somehow confuse low initial price with \\'value\\'. If an Accord costs 4 grand more up front but is still worth that same 4 grand more lets say 4 years later then than that more expensive car wasn\\'t more expensive at all - except for the time value ($250-$350/year) of the extra money borrowed. Finance 101 and an easy concept to understand. The facts are that those Camcords do have the highest resale values and generally lead the pack in terms of cost of operation. A good indicator of a car\\'s true cost to own is lease rates, I would suspect it may be actually cheaper (or close to the same) to lease an Accord compared to a Sonata or Fusion. But don\\'t tell anybody that wasted anything or paid too much for anything - it is simply not likely the case over those 3 to 5 years that most of us tend to keep a car.and you are right, a Fusion/Sonata priced (and sold) like an Accord will likely never happen - simply because the carbuyer expects those cars to be cheaper and the main reason why those cars will be less valuable at trade-in time. There does seem to be about 3 Accord buyers to every 1 Fusion (or Sonata) buyer that seem to understand all this. So, therefore, this discussion really should be more about the relative merits of each car and less about silly price.  patronizing statements like this are why some people think camcord owners are elitist.Huh? Patronizing? I stated the Accord (not \\'camcord\\' - the Accord) was the best in its class. Period. Even as a 5 year old design vehicle. Take it the way you want but many, many people have the same opinion as me. And the 2008 Accord will be even better. You can bank on Honda for that. They just have to watch their pricing. They can still get their \\'premium\\'. The market will support it.  A good indicator of a car\\'s true cost to own is lease rates, I would suspect it may be actually cheaper (or close to the same) to lease an Accord compared to a Sonata or Fusion.Sort of. I do lease vehicles most of the time and have found that the difference is not always there depending on where the vehicle is in it\\'s yearly cycle. You can almost always get a really good lease deal on a vehicle at the beginning of it\\'s MY run but certain vehicles, which do tend to have better resale like the Accord, still have decent lease rates at the end of the MY run.  Huh? Patronizing? I stated the Accord (not \\'camcord\\' - the Accord) was the best in its class. Period. Even as a 5 year old design vehicle.And that is exactly the attitude that zzzoom6 was referring to.Almost nobody buys a vehicle today based on objective criteria. Even if one vehicle has better mpg or is faster 0-60 or goes through the slalom or skidpad faster or is less expensive than another - most people don\\'t base their purchase decision on those alone. It\\'s a combination of very subjective things like interior/exterior styling, seat comfort, steering feel, power (how it feels as opposed to actual test figures), etc.If a test showed that the Accord was slower 0-60, had lower residual values and the worst reliability ratings of all the cars in this class - would that change an Accord owner\\'s opinion of their own vehicle? Of course not. By the same token you\\'re not going to change anyone\\'s opinion of their own vehicle by spouting test results and magazine ratings. And it has nothing to do with justifying a purchase decision and everything to do with subjective preferences that can\\'t be measured on a test track.Why can\\'t we just note the objective differences between these vehicles without making judgements about which is better or worse?  If a test showed that the Accord was slower 0-60, had lower residual values and the worst reliability ratings of all the cars in this class - would that change an Accord owner\\'s opinion of their own vehicle? Of course not.of course it would, and of course it should and the results of these hypothetical statistics of yours might actually have Hondas dealers floating discounts like never seen before. That requirement that all of us have to make judgements about which is better or worse is largely a function of our egos!  Why can\\'t an Accord owner/lover state he thinks the Accord is best in its class? Its not like its an outlandish statement.  Why can\\'t an Accord owner/lover state he thinks the Accord is best in its class?It didn\\'t seem to me that he said he \"thought\" it was best in class but rather stated it as if it were a fact and therefore everyone should see it that way. The Accord has won praise by many but there are still plenty of people, especially Camry owners, who feel otherwise. Therefore if in fact the Accord is the best in class and everyone should base their \"intelligent\" decision on that fact then why does the Camry consistently outsell the Accord?  Depends on whether the leases are subsidized and if the dealer throws in additional cash. For example, I can lease a Sonata GLS for $199/month with zero down right now, per local ads. A comparable Accord LX lease is also $199/month, but with about $2000 down.  \"Why can\\'t an Accord owner/lover state he thinks the Accord is best in its class? Its not like its an outlandish statement. \"We can, and it certainly is not an outlandish statement at all. However, owners/lovers of competing vehicles tend to get offended by such claims, because they feel that their vehicle is best in class for them, and then feel the need to defend their choice. We\\'ll never reach a consensus on this board as to what vehicle truly is the one and only best in this class. All we can do is share our opinions, look at facts, and make our own choices. There are so many different aspects to consider, and everything is constantly changing. Yes, my vote is for the Accord, but I certainly respect other choices (I\\'ve had two 626\\'s before which I felt matched the Accords of their day in nearly every way).I view this discussion as a way to learn things about other cars in this class that you can\\'t find out unless you actually own the car yourself, and I\\'ve tried to share such information about the cars I own or have owned.Please, lets be civil to one another, so we can keep the discussion going.  Toyota became the world\\'s largest automaker by 1) producing quality cars and 2) correctly evaluating driver preferences where that car is to be sold. In this country, that means a \\'soft isolating ride\\'. If anything I think folks are more likely to buy something that everybody else doesn\\'t have other factors equal. I don\\'t believe the fact that there are so many cars on the road that are identical to what I may have just bought is necessarily a positive influence on sales.  I view this discussion as a way to learn things about other cars in this class that you can\\'t find out unless you actually own the car yourself, and I\\'ve tried to share such information about the cars I own or have owned.Please, lets be civil to one another, so we can keep the discussion going.Amen to the civility. I\\'ve only owned five \"foreign\" cars: two VW Beetles (1958 and 1962), a 1977 Mazda GLC, a 1990 Mazda B2000 pickup and a 2000 Mazda Miata (MX-5) convertible. All were decent vehicles.Bender, how many Accords have you owned? The Fusions come in three varieties, the S, SE and SEL with two engine options, I4 and V6. How many models of the Accord?This go round the wife got to pick the car (her first choice was a Mustang but that was not practical at this time) and we ended up with a V6 2007 SEL AWD Fusion. I\\'ve heard so many good things about an Accord that our next car might be one.So, what do you like most about your Accord? We like the styling of our Fusion a lot and consider it to be the best looking vehicle in the mid-size car segment with the Accord being second.  Toyota became the world\\'s largest automaker by 1) producing quality cars and 2) correctly evaluating driver preferences where that car is to be sold. In this country, that means a \\'soft isolating ride\\'. If anything I think folks are more likely to buy something that everybody else doesn\\'t have other factors equal. I don\\'t believe the fact that there are so many cars on the road that are identical to what I may have just bought is necessarily a positive influence on sales.Two years ago, a Toyota official was quoted as saying \"the number 1 selling flavor of ice cream in America is vanilla.\"It made me chuckle a bit, but a very valid point.  grad, I know what you mean to say, but what you are saying is not what the other guy said. You have acknowledged that subjective interpretation of characteristics and features differ for everyone, so I respect your opinion. But saying that the Accord is \"the total package\" as the other person wrote implies that it is the best for everyone and beyond improvement. That\\'s just ignorant. It\\'s all good that others have found cars that meet their idea of perfection or satisfaction and that the cars that they chose are different from mine or others. But to suggest that they know what the ideal is for everyone suggests that everyone must be like them or else they are not as perfect as them. So when I use the word \"patronizing\" I do not do so easily or without cause. In my view, everyone\\'s opinion is fine, but doing so in a condescending manner isn\\'t.  Why can\\'t an Accord owner/lover state he thinks the Accord is best in its class?Why can\\'t an Accord owner/lover simply say that they love their Accord for reason X, Y and Z and leave it at that?Best in Class is meaningless. Best at what? What class? It doesn\\'t yield any beneficial information and only starts arguments.  If a test showed that the Accord was slower 0-60, had lower residual values and the worst reliability ratings of all the cars in this class - would that change an Accord owner\\'s opinion of their own vehicle? Of course not. of course it would, and of course it should Why? If I bought a vehicle and was happy with it why would I care about the other vehicles or where it ranked in testing? It might make me look at other vehicles when it came time to replace it but there is absolutely no reason that an owner\\'s opinion of their vehicle should be changed simply because of some test results or magazine rankings.If it does then that says the owner cares only about what other people think of them based on the car that he/she drives. Maybe that explains why some of the Accord owners are so defensive when anyone dares to question the Accord\\'s \"best in class\" status.  If many of us were more generous with using \"in my opinion\" when making statements about what is \"best\" and it would be even more helpful if many of us would add \"for me\" to those kinds of statements.I know that a lot of people believe that since we are here to discuss opinions in the first place that those kinds of qualifiers are implied and need not be spelled out. I am suggesting that those of you who would like to keep this conversation civil and continuing can help those causes by using those phrases anyway. Isn\\'t it worth a try?Akirby is right in pointing out that people are never going to agree on what is \"best\" across the board. It really isn\\'t useful to keep trying to get others to change their opinions. Are you willing to change your opinion based on people saying the same things over and over again here? No? Well neither is the other guy!   If I bought a vehicle and was happy with it why would I care about the other vehicles or where it ranked in testingby testing I\\'m assuming you are really talking about more statistically related things like residual values or reliability numbers and not necessarily a few tenths or a second here or there in an acceleration test. The answer to \\'why\\' is that if those Accords were really a reliability nightmares, those precious residual values suffered and that car started selling for a lot less money than what you paid for it, then it is hitting you right in the pocketbook. Buying a NEW car is an especially risky undertaking in these days of outrageous rebates and discounts simply because most folks are \\'upside down\\' on their car notes as soon as they drive it off the lot. So sure, if that hypothetical bad model year Accord of yours effects me in the same way and I am losing even more money on it every day I keep it, my opinion of that car should change, even if that car is everything that I dreamed it would be.If it weren\\'t for those \\'badge\\' buyers there would be no market for a whole lot of cars that aren\\'t even in this group and as far as getting defensive about buying an Accord, they don\\'t need to - those same sales, reliability, and residual value statistics provide all the justification needed - it is best in class. Whether you or I agree, objectively or subjectively, is not the point.  I don\\'t believe the fact that there are so many cars on the road that are identical to what I may have just bought is necessarily a positive influence on sales.Sure it is. Family members, neighbors, co-workers, etc. all hand out advice about everything to each other and vehicles are no exception. Word of mouth has been a big factor in Camry and Accord sales IMO. We all like to say that those two sell well based on the reputation that they\\'ve earned. Well how do you think word of that reputation gets spread?  I know that a lot of people believe that since we are here to discuss opinions in the first place that those kinds of qualifiers are implied and need not be spelled out.I have to say Pat, I\\'ve never seen it that way. We do post a lot of factual evidence so I\\'ve always seen it necessary to point out when something was my opinion or someone else\\'s opinion. Some people do come here for advice on what vehicle is best for them (And then read a post or two and run away FAST!! :P) so it is worthwhile to state a fact as a fact or an opinion as an opinion IMO.   I\\'ve mostly owned foreign mid sized sedans.My first car, in 1996, was a 1991 Mazda 626 DX (stick shift, crank windows, manual locks, cassette deck...) which I got with 100,000 miles. This lasted 40,000 trouble-free miles, until I wrapped it around some trees. I walked away but the car was almost unrecognizable.My second car was a 1990 Honda Accord EX automatic, which was a fun car, except I ended up wishing for a stick shift. I got that in 1999 with 100k, and for the next 40,000 miles it was the least reliable car I have yet owned. (The first owners hadn\\'t had any trouble in 100k miles, and I later tracked down it\\'s third owner, who drove it until 240,000 miles with minimal problems so I must have fixed everything that needed fixing). No major replacements like engine or transmission, but lots of minor to moderate repairs, and it left me stranded a few times.My third car was a 1998 Mazda 626 ES-V6 5-speed, purchased in 2001 with 50k. This car was a champ; as reliable as the first 626, but with more power and luxury. I miss this car. I sold it with 100k on the clock, because I was working in sales at a Ford dealership at the time, and being around all of those new cars, I wanted my first brand new one. I sold the 626 with 100,000 miles in 2003 for $5,700. I later contacted the guy who bought it and he said he\\'s had no problems, spinning like a top. Sellers remorse...The 4th car, my first brand new one, was a 2004 Ford Explorer. This was a tremendous value when new, and a shining example of engineering and vehicle design, however it was constantly plagued by minor issues since day one and I didn\\'t trust it beyond 50K miles (the transmission had been acting up since new, and the rear end had started making noise, both symptoms of major trouble coming down the road). Never did leave me stranded, but was in the shop I think... 9 times? And still, it wasn\\'t 100% right.And now, the new Accord. I bought it because the driving experience was almost exactly like that of the 1998 626. I wanted a Mazda6, but I saw that CR didn\\'t rate the reliability any better than the Explorer (\"average\") and I remembered back when I used to take the 1998 626 to the Mazda dealer how the advisor would tell me that my 2.5 V6 and manual transmission was \"bulletproof\" compared to the other combinations offered and compared to the Mazda6. I was afraid a new Mazda6 wouldn\\'t be able to live up to the experience I had with the old 626\\'s. So I thought I\\'d give Honda another shot. We\\'ll see how it goes!I know Fusion is similiar and is rated as more reliable than Mazda6 (for some reason). I drove both the SE 5-speed manual and the SEL V6, but I just liked the Accord better. The 4-cylinder Fusion felt sluggish, and the manual transmission felt like an afterthought. The V6 didn\\'t feel any faster than the Accord 4-cyl 5-speed, and was rated as having lower FE. Plus, I knew I wanted a stick shift. Mainly, the Accord reminded me more of the old 626, than the Fusion did.  My first car, in 1996, was a 1991 Mazda 626 DX (stick shift, crank windows, manual locks, cassette deck...) which I got with 100,000 miles. This lasted 40,000 trouble-free miles, until I wrapped it around some trees. I walked away but the car was almost unrecognizable.Shouldn\\'t you have named yourself \"benderoftrees\"? :shades:  If you care about these things the 2007 initial quality ratings were just released. The midsize sedan category was an eye opener.  If I had a manumatic, I likely wouldn\\'t use it unless I wanted to hold a gear for climbing/braking in hilly areas. It wouldn\\'t be something I used in daily commuting. It would just be a more convenient version of what I already have (D, D3, 2, 1). I have that feature in my Mazda6 and that is essentially how I view it. I also think it is better looking version of the alternative, which would have 4-3-2-1 in line after D. There are also two other potential purposes that I see, one is to manually downshift early when you are planning to pass on a 2 lane road. The other is it allows you to start in 2 in the snow, which is somethng some people like to do...I\\'ve never bothered with doing that myself.I mostly drove manuals in my 30 years of driving, so I sure did not buy an automatic with a manual mode to pretend that I still have one. This feature is nice to have, but would certainly not be a deal-breaker for me.  So I thought I\\'d give Honda another shot. We\\'ll see how it goes!Is it a 2007? I\\'m surprised that you gave Honda a second chance. The 1990 Accord EX must not have been too awfully bad after all.What model did you get? What was the MSRP? Our 2007 SEL AWD Fusion had a MSRP of $27,105. We considered the Accord and Camry to be out of our price range even though we didn\\'t talk turkey with the Honda/Toyota dealer (one in the same).  A perfect example of posting information without passing judgement or making any declarations of superiority.  Definitely an eye-opener. Impressive scores for Ford and FoMoCo products.  as far as getting defensive about buying an Accord, they don\\'t need to - those same sales, reliability, and residual value statistics provide all the justification needed - it is best in class. Whether you or I agree, objectively or subjectively, is not the point.IN MY OPINION I agree with you. Those that don\\'t agree with us can just ignore it, like the vast majority of posters here are doing. I\\'m not disparaging others\\' choice of car. The Accord isn\\'t some kind of anomoly or quirk. Its a fantastic car even tho its a 5 year old design! How many other 5 year old design cars can say the same?The 2008 model will surely be a hit - IN MY OPINION. The competition has laid out their wares. Honda will undoubtedly take all these into account for their next offering. I can\\'t wait to check one out.  \"I\\'m surprised that you gave Honda a second chance. The 1990 Accord EX must not have been too awfully bad after all.\"Well, remember it went from new to 100,000 miles over 9 years with its original owners with no problems. And then, as I found out later, after I sold it with 140,000 miles the third owner put at around 80,000 or more miles with \"minimal problems.\" Lets see, I\\'d have to pull the records, but off the top of my head... besides wear items and maintenance... intake manifold clogged (they had to drill holes), igniter failed (all electronics went dead including instruments as I was driving), starter solenoid problems, various electronic accessories failed. So no, not too awfully bad, no \"major\" repairs but it was the least reliable car I\\'ve had (except for the Ford, which is another story all together, but at least most of THAT MESS was under warranty so it doesn\\'t seem so bad. I just had to endure lots of Ford Taurus loaner cars).I did get a 2007 Accord LX 5-speed, MSRP $20,200? I paid about $17,800 (or $300 under invoice). A completely different animal than your Fusion, which sounds like a very nice car.  Here\\'s a thought on why it\\'s important for some people to feel as if their car is \"best in class\": if someone pays a significant premium for a car, they probably expect it should be \"better\" than other cars that cost less. The \"more better\" their car is, the more value the price premium they paid has. OTOH, if someone buys a car that meets their needs, at a relatively low price, the fact that their car isn\\'t \"best in class\" is immaterial. They got the car they wanted, at a good price, so that is what\\'s important.It may also be related to how some people like to buy cars from brands that have more prestige among the general public. That extra prestige has value to them and helps them feel better about owning their car. The more prestige, the better. And \"best in class\" adds to the prestige of the car.Then there are those who don\\'t care what the brand is, or even care if they are driving a 20-year-old rustbucket, as long as it gets them where they need to go.Different strokes for different folks. That\\'s why brands like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus etc. exist and do well.  So what would you do if you bought a 08 Accord this fall and then next fall the new for 09 Fusion beats the 08 Accord in every magazine comparison and in all the relevant objective tests (0-60, reliability, skidpad, slalom, braking, etc.)?Would you rush out and buy a 09 Fusion? Somehow I don\\'t think so. Nor should you unless you\\'re unhappy with the Accord for some reason.  I did get a 2007 Accord LX 5-speed, MSRP $20,200? I paid about $17,800 (or $300 under invoice).Sounds like you got a decent deal. I didn\\'t realize Accords started around $20,000. We should have shopped around some more, obviously.I realize the Taurus was the best-selling car in America for several years running but they never did much for me. Of course the best-selling title now belongs to the Camry and they don\\'t excite me either. Obviously my wife and I dance to the tune of a different drummer when it comes to the automotive world.Having many choices is a good thing, methinks. When it comes to popularity, I suspect Toyota and Honda will continue to lead the pack for quite some time.That\\'s not a bad thing. It makes the \"other guys\" try harder, produce a better product. Competition is good. Ford let the Taurus die on the vine, in my humble opinion.  Personally, the favorite in the clubhouse is likely the 08 Altima 3.5 but given that highly unlikely Accord/Fusion scenario you present - the \\'new\\' engine for the Fusion is supposed to be another 3.0DT this time at a relatively paltry 240hp and may not make it until 2010 or even 2011, the new Honda V6 which likely will make it under the hood of the 08 should easily be somewhere in the 260-270hp range and be available not only on time but also offer a diesel alternative (less hp more torque and really great FE). The direct answer to your question, is no I probably don\\'t rush out and buy that Fusion even if becomes (from a dynamic perspective) what you think it could, because that imaginary Fusion at least right now has neither the track record of long term reliability nor the history of high residuals that the Accord has maintained for 20 years or so. Do I go out and give it a hard look - sure, but those cars that have statistically proven to be \\'better\\' in those reliability/residual value-cost to own studies will always top my list and after that it generally comes down to power and refinement under the hood, which generally is my true top priority.  That was a hypothetical situation. I should just said car A and car B. It had nothing to do with the actual cars. I was just trying to understand your motivation relative to ratings and rankings.Even talking about cars that don\\'t yet exist you have to trumpet the mighty Accord and denigrate the lowly Fusion. That\\'s the type of bias that some of us would like to avoid here.  Well... I see your point, but it\\'s clear that several of us, and it\\'s not just the Toyota/Honda fans, give weight to a make/model based on its history. Keeping in mind that we all are entitled to define our own set of priorities, I really don\\'t think there\\'s fault to be found in that in and of itself.  grad, I know what you mean to say, but what you are saying is not what the other guy said. You have acknowledged that subjective interpretation of characteristics and features differ for everyone, so I respect your opinion. But saying that the Accord is \"the total package\" as the other person wrote implies that it is the best for everyone and beyond improvement. That\\'s just ignorant. It\\'s all good that others have found cars that meet their idea of perfection or satisfaction and that the cars that they chose are different from mine or others. But to suggest that they know what the ideal is for everyone suggests that everyone must be like them or else they are not as perfect as them. So when I use the word \"patronizing\" I do not do so easily or without cause. In my view, everyone\\'s opinion is fine, but doing so in a condescending manner isn\\'t. After reading the continuing posts, I certainly understand what you are saying. I should have prefaced my post stating my intention of saying the Accord was best for me. Every Honda owner doesn\\'t feel the same way, is basically my point. Every car in this forum has points that would sway some buyers (certain options at a price point, powertrains, styling, etc...). Choosing the best is merely picking which virtues are most important to you, then choosing the vehicle you feel best delivers those virtues.Just remember, one doesn\\'t speak for everyone , and everyone\\'s comments (mine included) should always be taken with a grain of salt.  Even talking about cars that don\\'t yet exist you have to trumpet the mighty Accord and denigrate the lowly Fusion.I recognize the point you are trying to make, Allen, and the sentence is taken out of context, but doesn\\'t the phrase \"lowly Fusion\" just add fuel to the fire?I believe our \"lowly Fusion\" stacks up very well with the mid-size sedan competition. Indeed, when it comes to styling and handling, the Fusion gets extremely high marks in my book.Let\\'s face it, when it comes to cars, most owners are proud of their decision and eager to defend it. Since there are hundreds of thousands of Camry and Accord owners, the Fusion lovers are always going to be outnumbered and out voted in a popularity contest.At some point in the future that might not be the case (it wasn\\'t always so) but for now it is.  Good post, thanks.  not denigrating anything - just a simple statement of what Ford has already announced for the Fusion, if one chooses to believe it. Ford does have a history of \\'too little too late\\' as far as cars go, and is not in a dissimilar position in the car market IMO than Hyundai/Kia, GM, Chrysler etc. And I didn\\'t bring up anything about cars that don\\'t exist yet - that would have been your \\'hypothetical\\' - wasn\\'t it?. You ask me whether I would even consider a \\'hypothetical\\' new and improved Fusion over a new and improved Accord, I answered the question honestly and even told you why. And this is some sort of \\'bias\\' on my part? or is it simply what you didn\\'t want to hear? Been on this forum long enough you should have known the answer to your question before you asked it - don\\'t you think? Besides which, we need to get off this thread - pronto!   The point I was trying to make, but obviously didn\\'t, was that you seemed to base your vehicle preferences on whether a car was highly rated by others (magazines, surveys, etc.) as opposed to whether the vehicle met your requirements or not. I was curious how you would feel if your vehicle that you love today was suddenly not \"best in class\" anymore (according to the media). Would it make you want to get a new car or not?Just testing a theory, not trying to start an argument.  Here\\'s a thought on why it\\'s important for some people to feel as if their car is \"best in class\": if someone pays a significant premium for a car, they probably expect it should be \"better\" than other cars that cost less. It\\'s not that people want to think their car is the best in its class, they already think its the best car in its class. Thats why they bought it. and then when they come here, or somewhere else, and see other people saying \"no, my car is the best\", they of course get defensive.People take a lot of pride in their cars (could never tell from here though :P ) and don\\'t like to be told (essentialy) that they goofed and bought an inferior product.   It\\'s not that people want to think their car is the best in its class, they already think its the best car in its class.Not necessarily true. For instance, I think the Acura TL is a better car than my Accord, but for my own reasons, I didn\\'t buy the TL. No they are not in the same class, but the same thing could happen within the same class. Someone could be shopping within this class, and say I know there are better cars in this class, but I will buy a Chrysler Sebring, because it\\'s the car I like, and will cost much less than the class leader. Some people know they are not driving the \"class leader\" and are ok with that.  Let me throw down the gauntlet and assert the latest JD Power IQ survey that just came out is again, IMO, a bunch of useless mish mash - even tho my perennial favorites ranked high on that list. But other makes that didn\\'t rank that good I highly regard (BMW, Audi, Cadillac, Mazda). There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the \"list\". With a few mulligans, you could probably invert the list and have it make as much sense.  I keep my cars for at least 7 years. Some time ago, someone posted that Sonata\\'s value would \"kill\" you if the car were totaled when it was only a couple of years old. That\\'s not what kbb.com says about my Sonata at 14-15K miles. Retail $14,590, Private party \"good condition\" $11,460 & trade-in \"good condition\" $9310. And that\\'s for the GLS, not the GLS \"Special Value\" which is essentially an LX except for leather and power driver seat. I paid $16,705 including doc fee, before TTL. (The doc fee was listed as a ridiculous $479, but it was built into the price so I didn\\'t care.) Under CT law, an insurance company must pay the average of NADA retail ($12,700) and one of a few other \"recognized\" sources when a car is \"totaled\" in a collision or \"other than collision\" loss. So, If my car had been totaled yesterday I would received an insurance payment of $13,630 (less any deductible, unless someone else was at fault in an accident). That doesn\\'t seem like a big depreciation hit to me for two years, only 19%. I think, and thought at the time, that Hyundai\\'s improvements would show up in it\\'s used car value within a couple years. Seems that that is happening. We\\'ll see what happens in the next couple of years.  JD Power IQ is just a way to give awards to cars that would otherwise not win any. ANY car can have a problem or two. What\\'s more important is whether or not the problem is fixed, or becomes something you just have to live with, as long as you own the car. Long term reliability is what I want, since I want to drive it for a long term (10 years or more). Obviously the more extra features or gadgets a car has, the more potential problems it could have. How many problems will the car have, after the warranty runs out? Do a survey on that, JD.  What year is your Sonata, again?Thanks!  Maybe that is the problem... so many people think their car is the \"best\" in its class. Well, maybe it is... for them, for their needs. That\\'s why I bought an Elantra in the fall of 2000. It was not the \"best in class\" in the opinion of most people (although I think Edmunds.com made it one of their \"Most Wanted\" cars a bit later), but it was the best fit for my needs at the time. I actually liked it better than any other car in its class, and the fact that it was one of the least expensive cars in its class was a bonus. Currently, one of the cars I\\'m eyeing closely for my next new car is the Optima. I don\\'t think it\\'s ranked \"best in class\" by any professional reviewers. But then, they aren\\'t putting up the money for my next car.   Useless? I think that\\'s pretty strong. I see some value in the study, if only to show what general direction automakers are heading on quality. For example, I find it very interesting that after many years of bottom-feeding in this study, brands like Porsche and now Mercedes-Benz and Kia are making huge strides in initial quality. I also find it interesting that some brands, like Lexus and Honda, have found a way to maintain their positions in initial quality, while brands like Toyota and Hyundai are backsliding a bit. And Ford is making impressive gains, as noted. The other interesting trend I see is a general increase overall in initial quality over the years. That is a positive trend for all of us.  Agreed. Most makers are getting better and better which is great news for us consumers!! Even Land Rover, which had the largest improvement - highest decrease in number of problems from last year, though it still finished in last place :P Hyundai did too well last year by finishing in third Kia\\'s was impressive - went from 24 to 12 Porsche continues to retain the top spot!!  JD Power IQ is just a way to give awards to cars that would otherwise not win any. Why? Just because Ford came out on top?How many problems will the car have, after the warranty runs out? Do a survey on that, JD.They do. http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/news/releases/pressrelease.aspx?ID=2006133And Mercury is number two. I guess that makes it a flawed survey, too.  \"Take it the way you want but many, many people have the same opinion as me. And the 2008 Accord will be even better. You can bank on Honda for that. They just have to watch their pricing. They can still get their \\'premium\\'. The market will support it.\" Oh I don\\'t know. I bought a 2006 Civic which was totally redesigned that year and it has NOT been \"even better\". I have had quite a few un-Honda like issues so apparently you cannot automatically \"bank\" on Honda for that.  2005. That was the only year of the \"special value\" sub-trim.  Useless? I think that\\'s pretty strong.OK. I\\'ll modify \\'useless\\' to insignificant.I mean c\\'mon. If it wasn\\'t for Landrover, Mazda would be dead last.  I mean c\\'mon. If it wasn\\'t for Landrover, Mazda would be dead last.Not according to this article.  Disclaimer: the following post encompasses issues of quality and reliability rankings as related to midsize sedans only. (This is on-topic, I swear!) I don\\'t give as much weight to JD Power as I do to Consumer Reports, because they report \"problems per 100 vehicles.\" While this is useful data, I don\\'t think enough weight is given to the severity of a particular problem. For instance, if midsize sedan \"A\" has 10 radio knobs fall off per 100 vehicles, and midsize sedan \"B\" has 5 transmissions fall out per 100 vehicles, sedan \"B\" appears to be of higher quality because it had less problems per 100 vehicles, even though the problems it did have were much more severe.Consumer Reports breaks the problems down further, so you can see the reliablilty rating for each car by categories such as Engine, Transmission, Body, Accesories, etc.I also don\\'t place too much weight on \"Initital Quality\" surveys. They are a good indication that the vehicle will be reliable in the long run but that is not always the case. Vehicles which score well in initial quality can start to display major problems as they age, while vehicles that did not score well in initial quality can maintain reliability over the long term. Actual long-term reliability studies are much more valuable in my opinion.  I didn\\'t realize Accords started around $20,000. We should have shopped around some more, obviously. Accord VP would be even less than that LX. But, his car is not at all comparable to your version of the Fusion. A comparably equipped, 4 cyl manual transmission Fusion, would cost less than the Accord and much less than your Fusion. Since I have recently bought one, I know more about pricing of Mazda6 than the Fusion. A dealer near me had recently advertised Mazda6i SVE, with manual for $14K. That is better equipped than the Accord LX, more comparable to the Accord SE (which is priced $700 above LX). I paid $16K for that car with automatic (which adds at least $800). So this is evidence of a $2500-4500 premium for an Accord over the 6. I don\\'t know if Ford is giving as good of deals on the Fusion as Mazda is on the 6.  don\\'t give as much weight to JD Power as I do to Consumer Reports, because they report \"problems per 100 vehicles.Consumer Reports breaks the problems down further, so you can see the reliablilty rating for each car by categories such as Engine, Transmission, Body, Accesories, etc.I personally (that means this is an opinion) feel the complete opposite as Consumer Reports uses self reported data from a subset of the population. If I was living in a vacuum and had no other source of information for a purchase decision, I would go with CR (they were great when picking appliances), put I *personally* don\\'t have a lot of faith in their automotive reliability rankings.  I really don\\'t care much about these IQS numbers, either.However, CR has it\\'s own problems, as well. Relying on self-reporting and evaluation of \"significant problems\" that may have occured as much as 12 months ago is just one. I actually give the most weight to the expected costs. This can be determined by pricing identical extended warranties from a single vendor for each model. Edmunds also bases their predicted repair costs on this. The differences between models of mid-size sedans are usually quite small.  Um, that was last year. The latest report, which came out yesterday, shows Mazda in a lower position relative to other brands. Hard for someone who likes Mazda (which includes me) to see, but consider Mazda has released several new models in the past year. That may account at least partially for the relatively poor result for 2007. Same for Hyundai... with all the new models they have released in the past year, it is more difficult to maintain their high rating from the recent past.  A Honda with \"issues?\" That even sounds odd. Would you care to elaborate? Nothing major, I trust. All cars, IMHO, have some issues, a squeak here, a rattle there, a bulb that burns out too soon. That sort of thing.Oh I don\\'t know. I bought a 2006 Civic which was totally redesigned that year and it has NOT been \"even better\". I have had quite a few un-Honda like issues so apparently you cannot automatically \"bank\" on Honda for that.  That 3 year study is potentially more useful to an extent, but think about what the numbers actually show. My wife\\'s \"un-dependable\" VW would have 3 expected problems, while the super-duper dependable Mercury will have 1.5. I don\\'t know about anybody else, but a difference of 1.5 \"problems\" during the warranty period is not going to sway me one way or the other. So what this confirms (for me) is that \"reliability\" is, for the most part, a non-issue in choosing a mid-size sedan.The typical range in expected repair costs of maybe $500 over 100,000 miles is also not going to influence my choice of midsize sedans.  We\\'re coming pretty close to on-topic, but if we could take the more general comments about how vehicles are rated to the dedicated Consumer Reports/JD Powers rankings discussion, it would be much appreciated.  And that\\'s the point I was about to make. Even the worst vehicle today is so much more reliable than the best car 10 years ago. Reliability really isn\\'t the big issue it used to be except for maybe a few outlying vehicles.  those cars that have statistically proven to be \\'better\\' in those reliability/residual value-cost to own studies will always top my list and after that it generally comes down to power and refinement under the hood, which generally is my true top priority.This from my post 1724, and I thought it answered your priority question pretty directly. More to the point is that, I probably don\\'t buy the Accord or the Camry and lean towards the Altima (with that great V6 naturally). A car that does a relatively decent job holding its value (but not up to Camcord standards) and is admittedly short of Camcord type fit and finish - the redesigned 07 is a big improvement. Given that I believe that overall it falls short of Honda/Toyota then why is an Altima on the top of list? It\\'s simple - experience - have put something in the neighborhood of 6-700k miles on my last 4 of them and not a one of them has ever had any problems, and that 3.5 V6 is outstanding. I did find the CVT disconcerting on the new Altima, but my wife loved it - it does make driving even less involving then even the 4 spd automatic in my current 3.5, so much so that I think that anybody that would even consider a stick will have no part of it.  >> jeffyscott says: \\'reliability is, for the most part, a non-issue in choosing a mid-size sedan.\\'Remind your family of that when your VW :lemon: leaves you stranded on the highway...\"Hey kids, sorry about your frostbite...but it\\'s only a few more problems than a more reliable sedan would have had.\"Even if the problems are minor, just be glad YOU have time to waste with the pompous VW dealership, and enjoy the rot-gut Max-Swill-House coffee.  Even the worst vehicle today is so much more reliable than the best car 10 years ago. Reliability really isn\\'t the big issue it used to be except for maybe a few outlying vehicles.agreed - if I keep up with routine maintainence, I expect at least 100k troublefree miles out of any vehicle I would buy although I will stay away from those cars that are seemingly overinfected with electronic doodads. BMW/MBs problems, IMO, have very little to do with anything other than overinfestation of technology, from an objective perspective - they both build great cars otherwise.  I\\'d be glad to even though a Civic doesn\\'t qualify for this discussion not exactly being mid sized. I bought the car new in Nov 2005 with about 9 miles or so showing. On the drive home from the dealer I noticed a faint noise from the right rear suspension on some types of bumps. I blew it off because this was a Honda after all (our first). My wife took over regularly driving the car to work and I only fueled, washed, and maintained it driving it short distances for those jobs. While I did start to notice an increase in the severity of the noise by July 2006 even my wife who wouldn\\'t notice if she was dragging the transmission for 1/2 mile (an overstatement to be sure)said \"there is a noise in the car. I already knew a problem existed and researched for any Honda TSB\\'s but didn\\'t find one for this. I finally took it back to the selling dealer in late July where an inspection found not only was the right rear shock bone dry (all fluid leaked out) which is what I suspected but additionally the left side shock was leaking badly. Both were replaced under warranty BUT I had to take off a 1/2 day from work,wait around etc. That cleared up one noise but made things quiet enough I could hear another which was a \"drone\" from the engine at around 1500 RPM in high gear. Honda issued a TSB for this one much later and I got the fix which worked. Now, yet another noise, this one in the right front while hitting certain types of bumps has been identified as a faulty motor mount by Honda. This one is pending because I have not had the time to take it in for repair. Additionally, the interior plastic is very prone to scratches especially, as design would have it, near the armrests/door pulls where one is sure to blindly grasp to shut the door resulting in many scratches/scrapes there. But interior wise the worst problem by far is the fact the cloth upholstry material is wearing on the driver seat cushion bolster. The woven? in pattern has all but disappeared on a 3 x 2 inch or so patch where our butts slide on entering and leaving the car. Currently the car has around 8,700 miles and I feel while it has not had all the problems 2006 Civics CAN have there have been enough relatively minor problems to send me packing back to Hyundai. Scroll through the service bulletins for this year/model where at last count over a dozen exist and some are pretty \"bad\" e.g. about 7 ea. oil sealing bolts scattered around the engine that don\\'t seal resulting in partial engine teardown for replacement. Power steering leaks, engine immobilizer problems resulting in no-start conditions etc. Nope whomever said reputation doesn\\'t sell cars is wrong...it sold me a Honda. My first inclination was a 2006 Sonata but that is another story.  \"Why can\\'t an Accord owner/lover state he thinks the Accord is best in its class? Its not like its an outlandish statement.\"Then why can\\'t a Fusion/Sonata/Mazda owner state they think thier sedan is the best in its class?? This is not an \"outlandish\" statement either.. :sick:  \"their \"intelligent\" decision on that fact then why does the Camry consistently outsell the Accord\"Same way I guess McDonalds sells more burgers than Burger King I guess..   More precisely...* What is the sales per dealer? (Per-store sales is an important metric in the sales business. Toyota has more dealers than Honda.)* How many are sold to fleets? (Many more Camrys are sold to fleets than Accords.)  lean towards the Altima I thought I\\'d test drive the 07 Altima this weekend. I\\'ve only sat in it and played with the controls a bit, but I agree - what a nice ride.I like it much more than the Maxima - what\\'s up with that funky Maxima grill BTW? I think the high end Altima cannibalizes the Maxima sales.  Lets try this one again..http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/pressrelease.aspx?id=2007088No comments? Looks like Ford is doing pretty darn well.. I\\'m going to have to keep this link around and spread the word. :shades:  I think the average age of the Camry is higher than the Accord\\'s. The Accord is also a more athletic ride which probably appeals to a younger driver.Both have the advantage of buyers walking on the lot, look at some colors, and saying \"I\\'ll take that one\" more than most other makes.  Read many of the previous posts. You\\'re late to the IQS party around here.  An interesting post, target. Thanks for the info. I guess it illustrates that even Hondas can have problems. It\\'s always been my contention that any make or model can have problems regardless of surveys or testings or ratings.We also considered the Hyundai Sonata but one dealer in our town owns the franchises for Hyundai, Mazda, Honda and Nissan while Sherwood Ford, Lincoln, Mercury has a sterling reputation and has been excellent to deal with. We own a 1997 Thunderbird and a 2000 Focus station wagon in addition to the 2007 Fusion.Eventually, all cars end up going back to the dealer for something, even if it is just oil changes or tire rotations. The dealer\\'s excellent reputation was a big factor in our purchase of a Fusion. The bold, distinctive styling also played a large part.We\\'ve only had the car six months and 3,420 miles but, so far (knock on wood) it\\'s yet to have a single squeak, rattle or thump. There has been zero recalls and not a single Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) has applied to our car. We sure hope this trend continues for the years to come.  Any car can have problems. You take your chances. See this post as an example of the irony of it all.bdkinnh, \"BMW 5-Series Sedans\" #11855, 6 Jun 2007 10:08 am  I believe it is currently possible to get a Maxima cheaper than a well optioned V6 Altima where the stickers can get above $30k pretty easily. Talk about \\'cannibalization\\'! While I pretty much stay away from subjective styling issues - to me, it is one \\'pretty\\' car.  What do you think about the new Nissan Sentra 2007?It has the same interior volume as the 2007 Accord (within 1 cubic ft).I has a better price, better fuel economy, great ride, less prestige and unknown reliability and probably lower resale value.Safety wise it\\'s got 6 airbags, ABS, EBD, etc, etc, even tire pressure monitors.  Safety wise it\\'s got 6 airbags, ABS, EBD, etc, etc, even tire pressure monitorsYeah but they are all optional (at least ABS/EBD) and TPM is going to be standard for everyone in the next 2 years as a federal mandate, IIRC.  Here in Canada you can\\'t get one without ABS and EBD.  Any car can have problemskd - of course, and likely in direct correlation to the the complexities of the car in the first place. BMWs problem is not that they don\\'t build the best cars in the world, it is more related to the systems they build into those cars, required to make them that way. Murphy\\'s law - the more complicated anything is, the more likely it is to break - A Toyota Avalon should never be as reliable as a Corolla, a Lincoln MKZ should never be as reliable as a Fusion etc etc.. There are exceptions to all \\'rules\\', of course - but as a generality, something that is true in a whole lot more things than just cars?  \"Why can\\'t an Accord owner/lover state he thinks the Accord is best in its class? Its not like its an outlandish statement.\" Then why can\\'t a Fusion/Sonata/Mazda owner state they think thier sedan is the best in its class?? This is not an \"outlandish\" statement either.. Uhh, they can last I checked . We each buy our own \"best-in-class.\"  Let\\'s say that the \"Acme Auto Company\" produces a competent mid-size sedan with a 225 HP engine. Hypothetically, Acme has new technology which will allow it to produce a more efficient engine. They can either re-engineer the engine to produce 50 more horsepower with the present gas mileage or keep the 225 horsepower and increase average mileage by 5 mpg. Which alternative would interest you more as a potential Acme-brand buyer?  To me? The mileage. I drive a 166 hp car and a 130 hp car. 225 would be excess to me, much less 275!  The Sentra is quite roomy, but it is 6 cuft less than an Accord. Honda reports different numbers for sunroof models and that lowers it closer to the Sentra.  No question the mileage. 225 is way more than enough. Anything more is really just about bragging rights, not driveability.  Personally I would not buy a Sentra based on its looks alone. I think the Versa is a much better value (and also has mid-sized interior room, albeit barely), and there are other compacts-with-midsized-interiors and even bona fide midsized (even full-sized) cars that would cost less than a Sentra, including Mazda6i, Optima, Sonata and sometimes (depending on incentives) Fusion and Milan. So, no thanks on the Sentra.  Let\\'s say that the \"Acme Auto Company\" produces a competent mid-size sedan with a 225 HP engine. Hypothetically, Acme has new technology which will allow it to produce a more efficient engine. They can either re-engineer the engine to produce 50 more horsepower with the present gas mileage or keep the 225 horsepower and increase average mileage by 5 mpg. Which alternative would interest you more as a potential Acme-brand buyer? This did actually come into play in my case. My old car (same make and model) was smaller and lighter, and a 4cyl was the only option. 140hp was adequate most of the time (could have used more power on the highway). 12 years later the car had grown considerably and a V6 was available. The fact that I could get 100 more hp, and still get the same mileage as the old car, made it a no-brainer for my driving style. I picked the extra power, thegrad picked the mileage. We both got what we wanted, so it\\'s all good.   This did actually come into play in my case.

We both got what we wanted, so it\\'s all good. Bingo. We each picked what suited us.The only time I ever need more power in my 130 hp \\'96 Accord is passing above 60 MPH. Around town, it is perfectly adequate. In my 166 hp \\'06, I\\'ve never \"needed\" more. It\\'s so quiet relative to my 96, I don\\'t mind winding it up to 5,500 RPM if I really feel compelled to take off.I got better power AND better mileage!  (although 70-80 horsepower less than elroy). My highway mileage is 8 MPG better in my new car thanks to iVtec and a 5-speed Auto!  Bingo. We each picked what suited us. and thats what it all boils down to. Anybody who wants to proclaim any car the best nees to keep in mind, they are in a pretty small group. Even the best selling midsize sedan (the camry) only has about 15% of the midsize market. So, for every 100 people who buy a midsize sedan, 85% don\\'t think the camry is the best.  15% thought the Camry was the best value, and actually bought one. Some people think the Camry is the class leader, but aren\\'t willing to pay it\\'s price (so they buy something else). Don\\'t you think, if all midsize cars were the same price, the Camry would get a higher percentage of buyers? I would still not buy a Camry, but I think many people would. I think the Accord would also get a higher percentage, if you could get one for the same price as say, a Malibu.  But, part of the \"class-leader\" part comes from its price. If not, it wouldn\\'t be limited to the class (a.k.a. Acura TL, Lexus ES350, etc...)Price has to be included in my opinion, if not, we blur the \"class\" issue.  Got to ride in the Milan that was modified. I know some here debate as to whether this guy knows what he is doing. The car is definitely faster than a factory Milan v6. The power is immediate, the engine grabs and seems to spin up quicker I asked him if he ever dyno\\'d the car and he plans on it. Once again, its a Milan V6 Premier with all the options. He added full dual exhaust, intake air system, chipped it, some lighter performance wheels/tires. The car was not a rip roaring V8. I have test driven a Camry V6, I believe this car would give the Camry a good run for its money.. Is it all worth it? I don\\'t know?? He does this for fun and as a hobby.  When price comes into the equation, we are talking about \"best value\", not \"class leader\". Two totally different things. \"Class leader\" means the highest selling car, and the car regarded as the best car in it\\'s particular class, irrespective of price. If the Altima comes out with a new special edition that is more expensive than the highest priced Camry, does that mean it\\'s the new class leader? Not by my definition, because it\\'s not out selling the Camry. Sure, the \"Class leader\" will usually fetch a higher price, but that\\'s not why it\\'s a class leader.  Well, I\\'ve heard it somewhere before, but getting into \"best-in-class\" can mean a lot of things.I mean, the guy who had a 4.0 GPA looks like the best in class, while in fact, the guy with a 3.5 GPA and lots of extra-curriculars and out-of-class work experience gets the job done better. (showing my age here!)I say that in a roundabout way to say, it may be instinctive to say the car with the best numbers is tops, while in fact, when it comes to getting the job done, others do it better, having fun along the way (just like in school!).I think (again \"I\") that best-in-class is still individual.  Power. Hands down.Most automakers have done this for years. Bigger, revised versions of engines with more power and the same (or improved) fuel economy.  When price comes into the equation, we are talking about \"best value\", not \"class leader\". Two totally different things. \"Class leader\" means the highest selling car, and the car regarded as the best car in it\\'s particular class, irrespective of price. You say it is the \"highest selling car\" and \"regarded as the best\". The highest selling car can be easily defined, but is not always going to be \"regarded as best\". If it is not, then which is the \"class leader\"?If price does not matter, then maybe we need to consider whether midsize sedans like the Audi S6 ($72,000) or BMW M5 ($83,000) out-class cars like the Camry and Accord.  If price does not matter, then maybe we need to consider whether midsize sedans like the Audi S6 ($72,000) or BMW M5 ($83,000) out-class cars like the Camry and Accord.That depends on other limitations of the class specifications. If you include those cars above then you are including mid-sized luxury sedans which can be, and often are, considered to be in another class themselves.Those lines can be pretty blurred though. Often when mags do comparos they make up classes that we don\\'t often realize are even there. Things like V6 powered AWD mid-sized sedans under $30k. That\\'s a small group, but it can be a \"class\". I see your point and also see how this line of discussion could end up in an endless loop! :surprise:   Is it all worth it? I don\\'t know?? He does this for fun and as a hobby.Oh its definitely not worth it, but man, its fun.  I\\'m glad he is happy with his mods and that they woke up his ride  It would depend on how the car handled...no point in having a more powerful car if handling isn\\'t very sharp unless going fast in a straight line is all a person is after. If I could get around 20mpg city, 25+ hwy (+/- 2mpg) like I am now, I\\'d take the more powerful one. But I\\'m not too sure about the track-record of this Acme sales company...seems they sold Wild E Cayote some pretty shoddy products.  But I\\'m not too sure about the track-record of this Acme sales company...seems they sold Wild E Cayote some pretty shoddy products. Nah, I\\'m pretty sure it was just operator error. He should have paid more attention to what he was doing and spent less time painting those \"uh oh\" signs for when he fell off a cliff.   Nah, I\\'m pretty sure it was just operator error.But his business card said he was a \"Super Genius\".   I realize that there is no \"right\" answer to this question; just wanted to know how others view this. I had a 220 hp SHO which was tested to 140 mph. It would also accelerate rapidly on an on-ramp and, with the 5-speed, pass quickly at highway speeds. Thus, 220 hp seemed to be as much, or more, power than I would ever need. Some recent comments have indicated that more power is needed to be \"competitive\"; just wanted to know how other feel.  I don\\'t think it would make that big a difference. theese are cars that fetch a pretty good price, and are not entry level, first time buyer cars. people (for the most part) who shop for midsize cars can afford a camry, or accord, or altima......if they want one, and think its worth it.  I realize that there is no \"right\" answer to this question; The correct answer is there is no correct answer; just as you have stated. Our 2007 SEL AWD 3.0-liter V6 is rated at 221 horsepower. The V6s in Camrys, Accords, Auras, Sonatas, Altimas are rated higher, I believe.We find that the Fusion is fast enough, powerful enough for our needs but the gas mileage is really terrible, 14.8 mpg in all-city driving. In retrospect, the 160-horsepower I4 engine would have been adequate for the type of driving we do, 95 percent in-city travel with only two or three highway trips a year.It will be interesting to read other forum members comments on how much horsepower (get up and go) is enough.  I look at it this way. As long as I can get mid 20s mpg in town, and high 20s on the highway, I\\'ll take all the power I can get. I can\\'t imagine having too much power. That\\'s like having too much money, there is no such thing IMO. There are luxury cars with a lot more hp (400 and more), and I don\\'t think any of the owners are complaining that they have too much power. I would not complain either.   You say it is the \"highest selling car\" and \"regarded as the best\". The highest selling car can be easily defined, but is not always going to be \"regarded as best\". If it is not, then which is the \"class leader\"? Sometimes there is no clear \"class leader\". The class leader can sell for more because it\\'s the class leader. It doesn\\'t become the class leader, simply because it has a higher price.If price does not matter, then maybe we need to consider whether midsize sedans like the Audi S6 ($72,000) or BMW M5 ($83,000) out-class cars like the Camry and Accord. These cars are in a different class. Who doesn\\'t know this? They can be the \"class leader\" in their own class.  HP=bragging rights and looks good on paper and to the person who is researching vehicles. What I don\\'t understand is these are supposed to be family sedans not sport sedans or race cars. When will the HP war end? Who knows? Frankly I look for substance and value in a vehicle. Do I really need a 500HP family sedan? Heck no. My bet is the consumer will choose by showing manufactures by sales numbers as to what they want.  Fusion S 5spd 4cyl in the paper today for $14,777!! with ABS and \"extras\". Only 1 at this price, but still.. what a steal..  One point to take a look at is the \"class leader\" has the lowest consumer rankings by actual owners?? (Posted above). This is puzzling to me. You would think the \"class leader\" would have at least a score close to other vehicles in this class or better. The other thing to look at is the amount of consumer reviews. Anyone who has had statistics knows what I am talking about..   Technology will continue to advance engine and powertrain designs. And improvements in fuel mileage and power will be made. You can even choose what advancement you want to take advantage of. You can opt for the high mileage of a Hybrid, or fuel efficient 4cylinder engines that have the power of V6 engines made 10 years ago. Or you can opt for the new V6 engines that have the fuel efficiency of 4cylinder engines of 10 years ago, and power of V8 engines made 10 years ago. Isn\\'t technology great!!!? :shades:  My 1996 got clipped tonight on I-59. I\\'ll post pictures and the story later on. Its a sad day, even though the damage is limited.  These cars are in a different class. Who doesn\\'t know this? They can be the \"class leader\" in their own class.Yes, they are in a different class because the price of the car does matter. This whole \"class leader\" claim seems kind of silly to me, anyway. You can not objectively determine that one car is the \"best\" in a particular \"class\". \"Best\" is a subjective judgement that a person makes based on their evaluation of a whole lot of objective and subjective criteria and \"class\" is a fuzzy term.  Yes, they are in a different class because the price of the car does matter.Price does matter when separating the classes. Not many people are going to test drive a BMW 5 series today, then test drive a Camry tomorrow.You can not objectively determine that one car is the \"best\" in a particular \"class\".The consumers have voted. The Camry is the class leader, so other car makers try to emulate it. Hyundai was following the \"leader\" when they designed the Sonata. If the Mazda6 was the class leader, I think the Sonata would be a very different car.Everyone does not have to agree on what car is best. Personally, I don\\'t like the Camry, or the Camry copiers, so I voted for another car.  Sorry to hear that. Hope no one was hurt, and all is OK.van  The law of averages catches up with you sooner or later. Consider yourself lucky that you got that far in mileage before it happened. :sick:  I believe the class leader in this segment, is the Camry even though the Accord is a better vehicle overall. The reason the Camry sells and sells is that it typifies what is needed in the segment. Decent, reliable, transportation, inexpensive to operate, room for a family. Toyota figured out what a family sedan was and rolled with it.As a car that I would buy, it\\'s last on my list, but I wouldn\\'t hestitate to recommend it (and I have) to people looking for a family sedan. People know what they get into when they buy a Camry, unlike Ford. There are a lot of people(at least that I know) that won\\'t go near a Ford again. It may be perception, but it is a reality. Those that buy Camrys may rate them a \"5\", but they know the car will always be a five. I don\\'t think people say that about Ford, even though the ratings may start higher.  I believe the class leader in this segment, is the Camry even though the Accord is a better vehicle overallI agree, At one time we had both in our garage. The Camry offers a markedly different drive than the Accord. The Camry\\'s kinda \\'Buicky/floaty\\'. The Accord is more \\'athletic\\'. Both were bulletproof and held their value very well. I get the Accord appeal. The Camry appeal is harder for me to grasp, but I understand it.  Isn\\'t technology great!!!?A very pertinent post. But one that makes me again realize that we should have bought an I4 2.3-liter 160 horsepower Fusion instead of the V6 3.0-liter 221 horsepower one.  even though the Accord is a better vehicle once again, thats just an opinion.  Decent, reliable, transportation, inexpensive to operate, room for a family. That can be said for any number of mid-sized cars, including the Accord, Fusion/Milan, Sonata, Optima, etc.If that\\'s all someone is looking for in a mid-sized car, they have lots of good choices besides the Camry. They just have to make the effort to check them out.  Of course it\\'s an opinion, how many times does one have to say: \"I believe\", \"in my opinion\", \"IMHO\", \"IMO\", etc.  Of course! You are referring to the marketing segment of family midsize sedans. But I was referring to the class leader as being the Camry (IMO, of course). And of course, I don\\'t know how much shopping people in general really do. I do know people who head straight for Honda and Toyota, for they think those cars are the best at what they do.  As a car that I would buy, it\\'s last on my list, but I wouldn\\'t hestitate to recommend it (and I have) to people looking for a family sedan.KDShapiro,What\\'s first on your list? What do you drive now?I disagree with your comments regarding Ford but understand that you are entitled to your opinions even though they come mighty close to bashing a manufacturer, in my humble opinion, and that is something that is supposedly verboten on this mid-size sedan thread.I guess that you have conveniently forgotten all those years when Taurus was the No. 1-selling mid-size sedan by a large margin. IMHO Ford allowed the Taurus to die on the vine, did not keep pace with the marketplace which, in turn, allowed Camry to move into the No. 1 spot.Will Toyota remain there? Will Honda move up? Will the Ford Fusion catch on and become No. 1? Will Sonata sales soar at some point in the future? And what about the Aura and the Altima? Will a Chevrolet Malibu work its way up?Will Camrys be smitten with another problem like the terrible oil sludge debacle?Maybe I am not typical, but I have always had good experiences with Ford products and currently own three of them, a 1997 Thunderbird with 85,000 miles, a 2000 Focus station wagon with 92,000 miles and a 2007 Fusion with 3,400 miles.Would I buy another Ford product? You bet. Have I ever owned anything manufactured by Honda or Toyota? No, but I have owned three Mazda products, which were also fine vehicles.It\\'s my guess that the Honda Accord is destined to become the No. 1-selling mid-size sedan and that\\'s fine with me. This great country is all about choices and competition, which are both healthy attributes.Boz  I guess that you have conveniently forgotten all those years when Taurus was the No. 1-selling mid-size sedan by a large margin.Yea - and 50% of those sales were to rental car companies, who\\'s requirements are vastly different than those to consumers. Also think \\'pre-internet\\' period where folks couldn\\'t research like they do now.My 1996 Taurus was a joke and cemented the forget-Ford feeling in my house. We traded that car for a Camry and the Camry experience was excellent. It\\'ll take many, many years for Ford to move up the possible purchase ladder for me. Probably won\\'t considering the plethora of alternatives out there today.  The consumers have voted. The Camry is the class leaderOkay, so now you are saying class leader = sales leader. Before it was the car that was also to be deemed best by reviewers or something like that. So why not just say it is the best selling car in it\\'s \"class\" or \"segment\"...or it\\'s the best selling midsize car? Heck, you can even say it\\'s the best selling car period.  I would say the camry is the sales leader, and thats all. I wouln\\'t call it best in class, best in segment, best car or anything else. Sales numbers are subjective. They\\'re affected a lot by perception, advertising, marketing, and a host of other factors. And I agree with what the other poster said about ford. I would never again in my life buy a ford car. Just too many bad experiences in the past. And that\\'s not unusual, most people who have a bad experience with a car won\\'t buy from them again. But, I think in the case of ford, they let quality control durring the 90\\'s slip to a level where they alienated a lot of past customers. I don\\'t think they did it on purpose, they just figured the future was in SUV\\'s and Trucks. They paid a lot less attention to, and spent a lot less money on their passenger cars. And it\\'s not my intention to bash Ford, just reality. They\\'ll recove eventualy, and if their cars don\\'t, they sell enough trucks that they will always be a big (even if not the biggest) player in the automotive market.  All are ok, and as you\\'ll see, the damage is purely cosmetic. I know this isn\\'t exactly on topic (although it IS a car listed for this page! :P ) but I appreciate y\\'all listening to me; we\\'re a midsize sedan family, ya know!? Long story short - Heavy traffic. Two-lane interstate each direction, 70 MPH. I\\'m in the left lane keeping up with everyone, doing about 70 (right lane was slooooow). Crazy-guy tries to pass me on inside shoulder unsuccessfully (he ran out of grass and nearly hit a guardrail). He is able to pass on the right (remember, I\\'m keeping up with what is in front of me within about 4 carlengths the whole time). He swerves over, and clips me. The policeman said it was obvious he wasn\\'t telling the truth, and I was, based on the damage pattern and my story. He got out of his car playing it off saying \"it was just a fender bender, no big deal.\" I may file a complaint at the courthouse, the policeman told me it was at my discretion to do so.My parking light is missing, and my passenger side low-beam doesn\\'t work, but both highbeams work, as well as the blinkers. Nothing too much seems to have happened under the hood. I drove it up to 70 MPH last night after it happened with no problem. When I had to turn off my high beams, I had to slow way down though, with only one light!Here\\'s one pic, the rest can be found on my carspace page. See more Car Pictures at CarSpace.com  And that\\'s not unusual, most people who have a bad experience with a car won\\'t buy from them again. But, I think in the case of ford, they let quality control durring the 90\\'s slip to a level where they alienated a lot of past customers. I don\\'t think they did it on purpose, they just figured the future was in SUV\\'s and Trucks. They paid a lot less attention to, and spent a lot less money on their passenger cars.I think that\\'s an accurate assessment, JD. People who have had a bad experience with a make or model tend to avoid buying another apple out of that barrel. Conversely, those who have pleasant experiences usually consider the same manufacturer when it comes time for a new vehicle.This is why quality is so important for all manufacturers and I believe the auto industry, as a whole, has make tremendous progress in the last 20 years and continues that trend today.I\\'ve owned a great many cars and trucks, both new and used, since getting my first car, a 1952 Studebaker in 1958 and none of them were really \"bad.\" Our 2007 SEL AWD Fusion is, however, in a league of its own (for the first six months). The fit and finish is perfect and there have been zero squeaks, rattles or things that go bump in the night. The car is flawless as far as we can tell. Knock on wood. I hope the trend continues, of course.I simply can\\'t imagine a Camry or Accord being any \"better,\" yet I am 100 percent sure that legions of Toyota and Honda owners are just as satisfied with their purchases, too.  The hubcap staying on is a good sign. Shouldn\\'t be any suspension damage. Do you know of a good shop in your area?  Well, he didn\\'t hit me below the fender, so it drives perfect. I\\'m heading to the dealer in a few to talk to a long-time family friend about it (he is sales manager, but is the type that wouldn\\'t even let us DRIVE a Passport back in the day because it wasn\\'t a good car), and where I should get the estimate. This crazy-guy\\'s insurance should cover it, since it was obviously his fault.  What insurance company does he have? Not Safeway, I hope. It could be easier going through your own insurance company, even if the other guy is at fault.  That\\'s one of those, looks (semi-OK)like not too bad, but until a good shop checks it out you can\\'t tell. Glad it wasn\\'t worse, and all runs out good. This kind is more frustrating, especially as you have maintained it.  Unfortunately today\\'s shops will look and say something like \"oh,front qtr, plus.\"...etc I hope you have a good shop relationship somewhere. Be aware how it will affect the insurance rates too. Also, considering all things, present and future, be sure to document everything,and keep the reports and pics,also consider seeing a doc, just in case, even if you don\\'t file for anything immediately, or ever. It could possibly \"bite you much later\". Again, happy it wasn\\'t worse, and you are OK. :sick: van  I simply can\\'t imagine a Camry or Accord being any \"better,\" They aren\\'t. at least not in any significant way. To the enthueasist, there\\'s differences. But, none that the average driver will notice. The one thing thats hard to factor into reliability statistics is maintance/care of the vehicle. If you do all the required maintanence when your supposed to, and don\\'t try doing it on the cheap, any car will last 10yr/200k miles. IMO, fords biggest problem right now is a lack of quality management from the top down. They\\'re in need of a bigggg shake-up. Not just changing CEO\\'s Kind of the same thing that almost brought Nissan down.  IMO, fords biggest problem right now is a lack of quality management from the top down. They\\'re in need of a bigggg shake-up.I think it\\'s really funny that Alan Mulally, Ford\\'s new CEO, owned a Lexus when he was hired. I wonder what he drives around in now that he is Ford\\'s top dog?  Having looked under the hood, I did a quick check and other than the headlight being loose, I don\\'t see much else. The car is still aligned perfetly, with no vibrations.I\\'m gonna bypass the doc, since the it didn\\'t really move me in the car. I didn\\'t skid a tire or even have a chance to swerve. He just clipped me, and we pulled over. I already have a knee problem from locking my leg on the brake on impact in my last crash (in this same car). This one wasn\\'t violent at all, and had I not heard it and seen it, I\\'m not sure I would\\'ve even felt the \"bump.\" I\\'ll get more than one estimate, for sure. At this point, I\\'m VERY lucky to have a 2006 Accord waiting on me in the driveway, and will drive it until the other car is fixed.I actually did not get the other guy\\'s insurance number/company, but the policeman assured me it would be in the report I could pick up Tuesday. I did my best to stay away from the other driver, he was a total loon. In fact, I even kept my car in D4 until I was sure he wasn\\'t getting out to approach me. I didn\\'t want him pulling a weapon.  Last I heard it was a Five Hundred, but I think he said he\\'s making it a point to drive every vehicle Ford makes.  That\\'s a very good idea, in my book. Thanks for sharing Allen. It\\'s good that he gets to know Ford\\'s products firsthand. Having owned and driven a Lexus he should have a pretty good idea of where Ford, Lincoln, Mercury needs to be.  He also spent a day selling cars in a dealership and spent a day with Consumer Reports and his engineers finding out what they could improve.He\\'s definitely doing all the right things so far.  He\\'s definitely doing all the right things so far. Now, if the bean counters will allow for the improvements!  I suspect the road to recovery and viability will be a long one. I wish him and FoMoCo all the best.  I suspect the road to recovery and viability will be a long one. I wish him and FoMoCo all the best. not necessarily. Nissan was in far worse shape in \\'99. the company was expected (by most experts) to file for bankruptcy protection within a year. With the proper management and recovery plan, they did a complete 180 in about 3 years. I don\\'t see ford being in any worse shape. they have everything they need to turn things around. They just need to have the right people who can do it.  \"What\\'s first on your list? What do you drive now?\"First on my list is the Honda. But when I went around looking for cars I was almost ready to buy the Honda Accord but I bought an XT instead. I needed something with more room that I could haul stuff and decided I wanted AWD. In addition, while it is not a \"family\" sedan, it is a family car and is as quick as all get go.I have had two Ford products and one of them better than the other. One had tranny problems right after the warranty expired.By the way not recommending a manufacturer is not bashing. For me there is no better choice in this segment than the Accord. The Camry comes in second, despite some prior issues. No car has ever been immune to issues, but the overall picture of the Camry is a good one indeed.  I bought an XT instead.Is that the Outback or the Forester? I heard the Outback\\'s lot more to insure than an Accord. Comments?  Sure. Here\\'s my first thought on that...Surprised. A safety gold pick (IIRC), AWD, less likely to be stolen. Seems like it should be cheaper.Question, is the Subaru we are talking about a turbo? Turbos raise rates. Another question. Is the Accord a V6 or I4?  \\'I bought an XT instead. I needed something with more room that I could haul stuff and decided I wanted AWD.\\'We looked at a Suburu but was disappointed with:-very poor interior room...especially rear seat leg room-build quality issues: door shutting sounds like a tin can, engine sounds like a bad sounding diesel.  There are no build quality issues. The door sound is the door sound and the rear can hold 5 adults without any problems. Subaru generally builds highly rated, reliable cars. It might not be as roomy as others with all of the conceivable options, but it\\'s not cramped either and some of the options are in the engineering. There are trade-offs in the Forester vs the EX for example, but I took the upside of the trade-offs with the downside of the trade-offs.  I\\'m getting a leftover \\'06 mazda6 s for 16,500. Do you think I\\'m paying too much? My friends and coworkers gave a split decision. My dad is furious that I\\'m buying a new car. My mom\\'s happy that it\\'s a new car.But none of them have driven the car. I\\'ve driven it and it\\'s fabulous. And a gorgeous looking car. I\\'m looking for an honest, anonymous opinion on the dealers price offer. I spent 3 hrs with him and he wouldnt take anything less that 16,500. What you think?  Seems like it would depend on what options the car has, and how many miles are on it.  Its not a demo car - just 6 miles on it. Only options are 6spd auto, cd changer (not a Bose), and chromatic rearview mirror. Everything else is standard. Standard front grille, 17in alloys, abs, traction control, airbags, floormats, remote locking, engine immobiliser etc etc.What you think?  Other thing is that he knows that he\\'s not going to get any more business from me. The dealer is 100 miles away and I\\'m not going there for maintenance. He said that himself.  You didn\\'t mention the car\\'s MSRP. Do you plan on keeping it for four or five years? Bear in mind that the 2008s will be out in the fall. So, even if the car is brand new to you it will still officially be two years old as soon as the \\'08s appear.On the surface, it seems like a good deal. The Mazda6 is a fine automobile, from what I have read. You seem to be very enamored with the car.Is there another Mazda dealer closer than 100 miles where you can have the car serviced? Having a good dealer close at hand is part of the equation, too.  There are no build quality issues. The door sound is the door sound and the rear can hold 5 adults without any problems. Subaru generally builds highly rated, reliable cars. It might not be as roomy as others with all of the conceivable options, but it\\'s not cramped either and some of the options are in the engineering. There are trade-offs in the Forester vs the EX for example, but I took the upside of the trade-offs with the downside of the trade-offs.I second the Subaru experience. It is also in a body style not offered by the other manufacturers (at least until this year) - a midsize wagon. It is also available with a manual transmission and AWD. In 2 years - I have been totally stoked with this purchase, my only remorse being that it is the base model wagon and in hindsight, the model up with more doodads would\\'ve been desirable, but the model we got undercut the cost of an Accord, so I definitely can\\'t complain about the diesel.Toyota bought GMs chunk of Subaru (and a little more, I believe) mainly to get access to manufacturing facilities in Indiana, but I would expect to see the typical Toyota pairing down of models to the one-size-fits-most level.  At 16,500, it\\'s 9000 off the sticker price. There are quite a few Mazda dealers close by but they dont have new 2006 version. They have used auctioned-of-rental cars but not for a price I\\'m willing to pay. I cannot bring myself to pay 15,000+ for an ex-rental with 20,000 mileage when I can buy the new car for 16,500.I\\'m not going to keep this car for more than 3 yrs. It has 4yr 50,000 mile warranty, so I plan to sell it at 40,000 miles. I think the next owner would be willing to pay extra bucks for the warranty.  Now, if the bean counters will allow for the improvements!He\\'s fixing that, too. He immediately took control of the capital budget away from the Board of Directors and he now has sole discretion of how to spend capital. That alone should help a lot.  By the way not recommending a manufacturer is not bashing. It is when it\\'s based on outdated or incorrect information.  My knowledge is not outdated, nor incorrect. More importantly it is based on my experience and the experience of others. If you give me the dollars to buy my next car I\\'ll happily be quiet. Until then I am entitled to my opinion.While Ford (and other manufacturers) are making strides to try and be more competitive in the global marketplace, I do not feel comfortable buying any of their cars.  Based on your additional information, it sounds like an unbeatable deal. Go for it and be happy.  And I thought I got a great deal on my car at about 7k off msrp! If you are planning on keeping the car for a while, then that\\'s an amazing deal. But if you are going to trade it in in the next few years, an 06 has depreciated a lot already. So is this the sedan w/ leather? Also what color? The only color that I thought I wouldn\\'t like in the 06\\'s was the burgandy one, but I saw it in person and it looks good. Anyways, if you are happy with the car and how it drives, I\\'d have to say the price is awesome so that should be that. Good luck!  it sounds like an unbeatable dealDoes sound good. Stay away from those \\'used or rental\\' unless you definitely know the vehicle\\'s history. New with warranty is a nice position to pay up for.Also - did you not see the latest Initial Quality Survey by JD Power that place Mazda next to last? I\\'m sure you have. I feel its an insignificant survey that in which your decision to buy a Mazda supports my feeling.  with mazda coming out with some new models this year (cx-7, cx-9) I\\'m not too surprised at mazda not doing well in the initial quality report by JD powers. But keep in mind, the long term tests have shown that the mazda6 is likely to have one extra problem over a 5 year period over the camry or accord, so in general it has been a very reliable car based on data from jd powers and consumer reports. Also, the latest crash tests of the mazda6 with side airbags show the car to be quite safe. One thing though, there is not an auxilary input for mp3 players and I don\\'t think the cd player will accept them. I recently installed an auxilary input in my 6 and I was able to choose where I wanted the jacks (yes I put in two input jacks...one for an mp3 player in the armrest, and another that plugs into my gps around the compartment in the dash). But if having support for your mp3 player is important, there are some options available that are easy to install - mine took about an hour and I\\'m not mechanically inclined at all.  Sticker price says 25,400. It\\'s a 4dr basic s model with 6spd auto and cd changer. I dont know if it was jacked up so discounts look huge ). Final price is 16500. Docs, ttl is extra. This is silver with grey cloth interior. I like red, but silver is fine too. A silver car looks cleaner than it is. You are right about the depreciation. I\\'m going to sell it at 40,000 miles (or maybe more) so I\\'ll have to take a hit. But I figured that this is at least better than buying the same car last yr for 20,000.  Apart from side-impact on the front, it\\'s a good safe car. It\\'s rated 3 for front side-impact and 4 or 5 for everything else.  Given the circumstances you had described, it sounds like a really good deal on the Mazda6. It\\'s not likely that you will top it. I\\'d snatch it up if I were you.Dumb question here but do all Mazda6s have a V6 engine? Is this one an I4 or a V6? I think you mentioned that it has a six-speed automatic transmission so it must be a 3.0-liter V6.  It\\'s a V6. Standard features are impressive to say the least. 17\\' alloys, ABS, traction control, 6 air bags, power seats, anti-theft device, remote keyless entry. I test drove used mazda6s and the car is a delight. Great handling, good power and lots of grip (I drove it with TCS off). Autoshift has a lag but good enough for downshifting on highways. The best thing about the car is the chassis. V6 may have less power than honda V6, but with that chassis it will be faster in the real world.  He\\'s fixing that, too. He immediately took control of the capital budget away from the Board of Directors and he now has sole discretion of how to spend capital. That alone should help a lot.That\\'s a significant development.  Now, if the bean counters will allow for the improvements! He\\'s fixing that, too. He immediately took control of the capital budget away from the Board of Directors and he now has sole discretion of how to spend capital. That alone should help a lot. That\\'s good to know. Thanks for all the information, I hadn\\'t really had a chance to read up on any of this.  Dumb question here but do all Mazda6s have a V6 engine?If you menat the \"s\" to signify plural, then no. If you meant to refer the version that is called Mazda6 s as opposed to the Mazda6 i, then yes. Mazda uses the \"i\" designation for the 4 cylinder models of the Mazda6 and the \"s\" designation for the V6.  I meant the \"s\" to be a plural. Thanks for the clarification. I learned something new today.   actually, in the latest ratings of the 6 with side impacts (this is the first year it has been tested with side airbags in the US - europe tested the 6 with side airbags a few years ago and the 6 did quite well), the mazda6 got 4 out of 5 stars for side impacts. Here\\'s the link:link title  I test drove used mazda6s and the car is a delight. Great handling, good power and lots of grip (I drove it with TCS off). Autoshift has a lag but good enough for downshifting on highways. The best thing about the car is the chassis. V6 may have less power than honda V6, but with that chassis it will be faster in the real world.Yeah, I\\'d have to agree with that. Grip in turns is just amazing for a midsize sedan and it corners so much flatter than other cars in this class which is probably why it feels so composed. And the strange/ great thing is, it doesn\\'t have a harsh ride. Usually with a suspension that is really good in mid-corner, most cars tend to get a bit harsh, but I think the Mazda6 is very well dampened when hitting bumps. It\\'s the best of both worlds and is what makes the 6\\'s chassis so highly regarded.I bought my car in Nov of 05 so the 06\\'s were out already and I bought a 2005 leftover with manual tranny, v-6, bose and sunroof for 19.5, so you\\'re getting about $400 less in net options (you\\'ll have auto, but no bose/sunroof) w/ an extra 3k off what I paid. Plus your car will be much easier to keep clean than mine which is dark grey...one thing I love about silver cars. So to get that price, do you have to finance through Mazda? I had to in order to get an extra 1k in rebates, but I paid mine off in a few months with another loan w/ lower interest so no big deal. I\\'m just amazed at the deal you\\'re getting... btw, if you do a fair amount of grocery getting, check out the organizer tray for the trunk... it\\'s awesome for keeping things from rolling around and getting damaged while taking corners faster than you should with a dozen eggs in the trunk :shades:  taking corners faster than you shouldI don\\'t think that\\'s really possible in the 6, is it? On the side impact testing, IIHS never retested with side air bags. Their test is tougher than the US or European gov\\'t testing.  Has anyone checked the KBB or NADA used car guide to see what this left over \\'06 Mazda6 will be worthe once it\\'s registered and driven off the lot.I haven\\'t checked...just a thought for consideration.  Also - did you not see the latest Initial Quality Survey by JD Power that place Mazda next to last?Well, fortunately for this particular buyer, the Mazda6s he is considering is a 2006, and Mazda did better in the 2006 IQS.   Has anyone checked the KBB or NADA used car guide to see what this left over \\'06 Mazda6 will be worthe once it\\'s registered and driven off the lot. Well, according to edmunds, trade in value is $16,400 for a base 2006 Mazda6 s, with automatic. I used 6 miles on the OD and \"outstanding\" condition.  Reading your posts, looks like your a bit behind the curve.. Ford Fusion/Milan are getting excellent reliability/quality marks. Ford just won 5 quality awards from JD powers also..   Forgive me scrape, but I\\'m a little confused. I was saying that I didn\\'t realy consider camcordias any \"better\" than a ford. I was actually taking up for Ford. what I was saying was that any new car from most automakers will easily run well for 10 yrs/100k miles, if properly taken car of.  Okay, let\\'s let that be the end of this latest off-topic wandering. We need to get back to the cars - please.  you\\'ll have to forgive scape and akirby, anything that even can be construed as slightly negative on the Fusion is by definition \\'Ford bashing\\'. The fact of the matter is that all cars, even Camcords, have things about them that \\'lag\\' the other cars in this group. The Camcords can be \\'bashed\\' for high initial prices, difficult dealers, and in some opinions styling, the Fusion certainly for its substandard powertrains, no ESC, and relative interior fit/finish. The car that I\\'m surprised we don\\'t hear about more on this forum - the Aura XR - a really good effort on GMs part IMO. I agree that any car should usually provide that 100k of relatively troublefree service including those Camcordimas and Fusions. As for what is class leading? - beauty is largely in the eye of the beholder.  You think a statement like \"the Fusion certainly for its substandard powertrains\" is slightly negative?I don\\'t mind bashing where it\\'s deserved but most of it here isn\\'t.The Fusion has best in class reliability according to multiple sources and it offers AWD - something the Camcords don\\'t. The powertrains and interiors are perfectly adequate - not great, I\\'ll admit - but not bad and certainly not substandard by any stretch of the imagination.  Good God...If simply stating a fact is bashing then we might as well all go home and stop talking about cars for the rest of our lives.Fact: Ford Fusion has the second lowest ouput V6 engine in this class.All right, now call me a Ford basher. :confuse: :sick:  does leaving between 20 and 50 HP on the table to all the cars in this group while offering no advantages in FE qualify as \\'substandard\\'? Even the 4 banger suffers from similar deficiencies at obviously smaller differentials. And that is before we talk about the whole issue of powertrain refinements, which I admit is somewhat subjective but apparent to most that have actually driven the cars. \\'Adequate\\' or \\'not bad\\' by most definitions does not equal \\'class leading\\', IMO. Again IMO, the Fusion/6 are well designed cars that do have some good points, but not anything you\\'ll find under the hoods relative to what else is available in this class. And I can\\'t imagine that you or anybody else can consider this \\'bashing\\' a simple review of drivetrain/FE specs along with hopefully a few test drives are all most folks should - one way or the other.  How is calling something \"substandard\" just stating a fact? It\\'s making a judgement that many others don\\'t agree with.Ford Fusion has the second lowest ouput V6 engine in this classPerfectly accurate. You could also just say that it\\'s 221 hp vs. 240 or 265 in the Accord and Camry respectively.For me (and probably a lot of other V6 buyers) 221 hp is more than enough and I could care less if the competition has more. I see the facts and make my own judgements. But other potential buyers who see \"substandard\" this and that and other totally subjective and in some cases undeserved criticisms may get the wrong impression and not even consider a Fusion or Milan.  does leaving between 20 and 50 HP on the table to all the cars in this group while offering no advantages in FE qualify as \\'substandard\\'?Depends on what you consider \"standard\". Who said that 240+ hp in a FWD family sedan is \"standard\"? You seem to be caught up in some engineering competition. I\\'ll certainly give you that - the DT3.0 does not represent state of the art in engine design. Ford\\'s entry in that competition would be the 3.5 and it is competetive. The DT3.0 also probably a lot cheaper than the other V6s including Ford\\'s own 3.5L (until production is ramped up).However, in the real world application of a midsize family sedan the DT3.0L is perfectly adequate and not substandard to anything.   Who said that 240+ hp in a FWD family sedan is \"standard\"? that\\'s easy - something in the neighborhood of a several hundred thousand Camcordima buyers (and Aura buyers and Sonata buyers etc.). And yes, HP and powertrain refinement issues are certainly on the top of my personal list.  Better go tell the 80% of Camcord buyers that bought 4 cylinder models that their vehicles are substandard.  Better go tell the 80% of Camcord buyers that bought 4 cylinder models that their vehicles are substandard.Apples and oranges - people who buy 4 bangers do so for some logical reasons which are hard to dispute. Whether I think it is enough HP or not is not the point, they are buying that 4 banger for FE and to save a little money. This is why, BTW, I only mentioned \\'hundreds of thousands\\' V6 buyers (instead of well over a million), simply because only 20 or 30% of the Camcordimas are bought with V6s.  we might as well all go home and stop talking about cars for the rest of our lives. Yeah, we\\'d kinda rather you not do that  But it\\'d be nice if we could stop nit-picking and stop focusing on who is/isn\\'t a basher, an enthusiast, or a loyalist, who should/shouldn\\'t say what and how it should be stated, and which statements are facts vs. opinion. Focusing on that stuff makes the conversation seem 1) about other members\\' credibility rather than about vehicles, and 2) pedantic. Thanks for keeping focused on the cars.  How is calling something \"substandard\" just stating a fact?I don\\'t know about you but to me \"substandard\" and \"below-average\" are more or less the same. The Fusion\\'s V6 is indeed below-average within this class.You could also just say that it\\'s 221 hp vs. 240 or 265 in the Accord and Camry respectively.I could, and I would also add Altima, Aura XR and Sonata. Spin it all you want the fact is that Fusion\\'s V6 is at bottom of the pack.For me (and probably a lot of other V6 buyers) 221 hp is more than enough and I could care less if the competition has more.Fine, so the Fusion\\'s 221 HP is more than enough for you but that still doesn\\'t change the fact that it is trailing others in the power output department. Believe me, I myself is a horsepower nut and that\\'s why I don\\'t drive a midsizer anymore (the reason I am here is because I think this is the most interesting segment and I used to own a 97\\' Honda Accord LX. Also, I might be soon to help my sister and parents to purchase another 2 midsizers). However, I wouldn\\'t mind to recommend Fusion to anyone that wants a \"relatively\" inexpensive midsize yet offers good quality fit-n\\'-finish and decent performance.  I for one love the heated discussions that go on in this thread. Yea, some of the nit picking and bragging/bashing gets a little old, but the passion a lot of people here have for their vehicles is just........unbelivable. If the suits from ford, toyota, nissan, honda, could see this, I think they\\'d be awfully proud. And being that most of the guys and gals here back up their claims with hard data, I\\'ve learned a ton about these cars and whats in them, far more than I ever knew before.But your right, sometimes it does go a little too far, but for the most part, one of the most useful forum discussions on the net that I\\'ve seen.  calling the engine in the fusion/6 sub-standard is like calling the brakes in the accord sub-standard since the accord takes 20 longer feet to stop from 70mph than the camry and ranked the lowest in the c&d comparo vs 5 other midsizers. But the truth is, is that 194 feet from 70 isn\\'t all that bad and to suggest that the Accord\\'s brakes are sub-standard is a stretch and an exageration. It could be, and often is, said that the Accord\\'s braking performance is a bit long for it\\'s class, but labeling it sub-standard would suggest that it is unsafe and inadequate for driving safely. But the thing is, when a car is evaluated, it is the WHOLE car that should be evaluated. While individual components are important, just because one component is not as good as it\\'s competition should not be that big of a deal. And I don\\'t think anyone here is saying that the Fusion/6 v-6 is TOO slow to be considered fun/ safe. In the end, I\\'d rather have an engine that takes a couple more tenth\\'s to get to 60mph than to have a car that takes an extra 20 feet to avoid an accident.One other thing...how often is a car pushed where the engine is actually outputing that extra 20 or 30 HP? Though I like to drive to have fun, very rarely am I pushing my car to where I am using all 220 HP. And even with my \"measly\" 220HP engine, I\\'m still faster than more than 90% of the cars on the road so if that\\'s substandard to you, so be it. And I don\\'t think that a car with a substandard engine would make Consumer\\'s Digest\\'s Sportiest Car list, Edmund\\'s Editor\\'s most desired sedan under 25k, or Esquire\\'s most desired cars list. Just like the Accord isn\\'t precluded from winning it\\'s awards despite having brakes that stop a bit longer than most of it\\'s competition.  The exchanges on this forum certainly are lively and entertaining. For the record I\\'m not here to bash anybody\\'s product or opinion.That being said, our 2007 V6 SEL AWD Fusion ($27,105 MSRP) is the nicest car my wife and I have ever owned, dating back to 1958.The 3.0-liter, 221-horsepower engine is more than adequate in all driving situations. It is coupled to a best-in-class six (6) speed automatic transmission that is flawless, smooth as silk in all driving situations.OK, the Fusion is not the fastest mid-size sedan 0-60, but how many people truly engage in stoplight racing? How many people really care about such things? The Fusion is certainly not under powered. At least not for us. It is a tried and true power plant known for its reliability, dependability.The fit and finish on our Fusion is simply outstanding. It could not be any better. Perfection cannot be improved upon. Is this typical? I don\\'t know, but ours is this way. Everything looks as it should, works as it should. After six months of ownership there has not been a single squeak, rattle, thump or bump in the first 3,400 miles of operation.One of the biggest selling points for us is the bold, distinctive styling. The Fusion is unique in its looks and this is a very good thing in our book. The other cars in the mid-size sedan category look bland, to us.Our Fusion is loaded with creature comforts and safety features. It handles like it is on rails. The ride is extremely comfortable, yet sporty, thanks to 17-by-7.5 inch machined aluminum wheels and P225/50R/17 Michelin Pilot tires.In short, we bought a car that was best for us. We\\'re sure that many Camry, Accord, Aura, Altima, Sebring, Legacy, Sonata, Mazda6, etc. owners feel the same way about their automobiles.Could Ford improve the Fusion? Yes, and is doing so for the 2008 model year. Could all of the other cars in the mid-size segment be improved in some way? Of course.We think Ford has a genuine winner in the Fusion, a product that is a better idea, a bold, distinctive one at that.  But your right, sometimes it does go a little too far, but for the most part, one of the most useful forum discussions on the net that I\\'ve seen.It\\'s not likely that anything written here is going to make converts out of anybody. Auto enthusiasts are generally passionate about their choices, often with good reason.  Then I consider the Camry and Accord to be substandard because they don\\'t offer AWD.You\\'re basing these drivetrain comparisons on bench testing data and spec sheets, not on how the vehicles themselves perform in the real world and certainly not on customer expectations. Outside of a few enthusiasts (and horsepower nuts like yourself) the extra power doesn\\'t matter.  Then I consider the Camry and Accord to be substandard because they don\\'t offer AWD. Then the Fusion is also substandard since it doesn\\'t have a hybrid variant (at least not yet), doesn\\'t offer push-button start, and has no navi option. We can go at it all day all you want and that\\'s not going to get anywhere. It\\'s silly...By the way, I am NOT basing my opinions on spec sheet or any mag comparos. I drove Fusion, Mazda6, Camry, Altima, Accord, G6 before and my opinions are basing on my personal experience. I said it really clear in my previous post, I would glad to recommend anyone who wants a \"relatively\" inexpensive midsizer with good quality and performance. However, that still doesn\\'t reduce that fact that Fusion DOES have one of the weakest V6 in this segment.That\\'s a fact. Let\\'s not arguing with facts.  Then I consider the Camry and Accord to be substandard because they don\\'t offer AWD. You\\'re basing these drivetrain comparisons on bench testing data and spec sheets, not on how the vehicles themselves perform in the real world and certainly not on customer expectations. Outside of a few enthusiasts (and horsepower nuts like yourself) the extra power doesn\\'t matter. I consider the Ford Fusion \\'substandard\\' (your term) because it doesn\\'t meet the most of the standards set by the Accord in terms of power, transmission, handling, fit/finish, ergonometrics, and especially proven long term performance. The Sonata comes closest. I\\'d buy one of those before settling for a Fusion. The envious tones in your posts are so clear. But the Accord is a tough act to follow, and will be even tougher when the 2008 appears on dealer lots.  I don\\'t believe the Fusion is a superior car and I\\'m certainly not envious of anything. I\\'ve owned 2 Hondas and 1 Acura and if the Fusion wasn\\'t available I probably would have bought an Accord.I understand the Fusion\\'s limitations - it\\'s basically a clean sheet first effort for Ford after ignoring the segment for many years. The Camry and Accord are still the benchmarks in this segment but that does not mean they do everything well or that other vehicles aren\\'t competitive.I\\'m simply tired of people making negative statements without any basis in fact just because they don\\'t like Ford.  The envious tones in your posts are so clear. But the Accord is a tough act to follow, and will be even tougher when the 2008 appears on dealer lots. I don\\'t know. appearence wise, I like the 2007 better. Honda seems unwilling to do anything darring with its accord design. And being as the accord does most everything else very well (safty, reliabilty, finish) there\\'s not a whole lot of room for improvement.  I would glad to recommend anyone who wants a \"relatively\" inexpensive midsizer with good quality and performance. However, that still doesn\\'t reduce that fact that Fusion DOES have one of the weakest V6 in this segment.If inexpensive is what is wanted, they should be looking at the 4 cylinder models, anyway.   If inexpensive is what is wanted, they should be looking at the 4 cylinder models, anyway.Okay, let me rephrase...I would glad to recommend anyone who wants a \"relatively\" inexpensive V6 midsizer with good quality and performance. However, that still doesn\\'t reduce that fact that Fusion DOES have one of the weakest V6 in this segment. You a**... :P  I owned a 2007 Camry, quickest and nicest interior, very good on mileage, handled like a tank. I own a 2007 Altima, still very quick, handles very well, interior more sporty but cheaper feeling. I\\'ve driven the Fusion and it\\'s a nice car that handles well, looks nice, doesn\\'t have the huspa the others have and feels smaller. The Accord is all around great, but still not as qucik as Camry or Altima. These are all nice cars and will each find buyers. If they were all the same, we wouldn\\'t have choices. What ever your driving and what ever you like, be passionate about it and enjoy your ride! Consumers Reports rates Fusion/Milan down the line from the others, and the Altima is \"virtually\" tied now with the Accord.  it\\'s basically a clean sheet first effort for Ford after ignoring the segment for many yearsOK, since you are so consistent about reprimanding all of us about \\'the facts\\' then I\\'d like you to explain to me how the Fusion is a \\'clean sheet\\' anything - a slightly softened chassis and chassis design borrowed from Mazda, a 4 banger of Mazda origin, a V6 engine dating from the Taurus of the mid 90s, a 4WD system borrowed from Volvo etc. etc. What exactly is \\'clean sheet\\' the razor blade grille and clear lens tailights? Please, please provide me with this \\'basis in fact\\' you mention, I\\'ve been wrong before - just ask my wife . I wouldn\\'t even claim that the new Camry, Altima or Aura is \\'clean sheet\\', and would be willing to bet that even the new Accord won\\'t borrow heavily on previous on its predecessors. I agree with you about one thing, though, the Fusion is a credible effort to get Ford back into the car business after many years of neglect.  would be interested on your comments on the CVT, the car you drive is tops on my wife\\'s shopping list?  I don\\'t know. appearence wise, I like the 2007 better. Honda seems unwilling to do anything darring with its accord design.I\\'m with you, Egg. Appearance-wise I find the 2007 to be more attractive than the spy photos that I\\'ve seen of the \\'08s so far. To be sure, Honda is not very daring when it comes to the style of their cars. Maybe they don\\'t have to be. At least the Accord looks better than the Camry, IMHO.  I will throw this out.I am totally in agreement with those who claim the superiority of the Honda Toyota et al engines. However, this is because of the their greater fuel efficiency, not because of their power. In regards to power I agree with the Ford camp that says 220 is plenty. 220 is more than enough. I had a Taurus with the 140hp Vulcan, and not once did I think it needed to be faster - many times I wished it got better gas mileage though.What if Toyota put the technology in their 3.5 liter engine into their 3.0. So what if it was down a few hp. It would still be plenty fast and would get even better mpg.We are sending far too many dollars to OPEC countries. Fuel economy is not just about dollars saved.To be totally honest, a v-6 is superfluous in the vast majority of situations. Fun...yes, but so is the I4 with a stick.Besides if you want fun just buy an old Miata - to bomb around in on the weekends. Most daily commutes generally do not offer very many oppertunities to have \"fun\" with the engine. The gas saved and the purchase money saved will easily pay for the Miata.Why cruise around with all that power only to use it a small percentage of the time? As it is I rarely get a chance to put the spurs to my I4. Though I do consider buying an overly powerfull engine to be wasefull, I would certainly not put it in the same category of wastefullness as commuting to work in a Suburban by oneself.Understand, that I am speaking in general terms. I know some people with V-6 engines that get better mpg than those with the 4-cyl (mostly due to driving style and transmission choice).To finish up, I really look forward to seeing the new crop of more efficient drivetrains in the midsized segment - especially the diesels.  and would be willing to bet that even the new Accord won\\'t borrow heavily on previous on its predecessors.I think you meant to say the opposite of what the words say, that you would be willing to bet that the new Accord WILL borrow heavily from its predecessors. To be sure the 2008 Accord will not be all new, from the ground up. Not from what I\\'ve read anyway.  yep, sorry about that...  Clean sheet for Ford - compared to the existing Taurus. The Taurus was replaced by 2 vehicles - the Fusion and the Five Hundred (now renamed Taurus). Yes, for the Fusion they started with the Mazda6 platform but they lengthened and widened it. The Five Hundred started with a Volvo D3 platform. And last time I checked Ford owned Volvo and a controlling interest in Mazda. That\\'s like saying Acura borrows from Honda or vice versa. It\\'s all the same company.Speaking of facts - the AWD system used on the Fusion is NOT the same one used by Volvo. It\\'s an all Ford in house engineered version. The DT3.0L is not the same engine used in the Taurus. The Taurus never had VVT. THIS is the type of misleading misinformation about the Fusion that I\\'m talking about. Next you\\'ll claim the Escape Hybrid\\'s powertrain came from Toyota (which is also not true).  I really look forward to seeing the new crop of more efficient drivetrains in the midsized segment - especially the diesels.We recently bought a 3.0-liter V6 Fusion but our next car will definitely be a four-banger and hopefully a diesel four at that, simply for the superior fuel mileage. We didn\\'t need a V6 and have buyer\\'s remorse for getting it.  the Fusion and the Five HundredIs the new Taurus/Five Hundred also going to be considered as a mid-size sedan? I\\'d consider it one.The car I test drove looked promising as I was sitting in it but it soon disappointed me with its lack of power. Once they upsize the engine that car could be a good seller. Its a nice size ride.  Finally something I can agree on. Ford is definitely behind the curve as far as fuel mileage. But the new Taurus 3.5L actually increased mileage over the old 3.0L Five Hundred (both using the 2008 test results while adding 63 hp. A good trend. Let\\'s hope we see the same thing or better when the 3.5L makes it to the Fusion.2007 Five Hundred 19 city, 26 hwy, 21 combined2008 Five Hundred 18 city, 28 hwy, 22 combined  Is the new Taurus/Five Hundred also going to be considered as a mid-size sedan? I\\'d consider it one. No, it\\'s classifed as a large car according to the EPA. The back seat has more room than a Crown Vic. But it should drive more like a smaller car.  well then I guess we have a difference in definitions, \\'clean sheet\\' to me means something new and/or not used before - something that only the Sonata in this group has a reasonable claim to. The Ford \\'VVT\\' and please correct me if I\\'m wrong, is not the same sort of thing as the Toyota CVVTi, the GM CVVTi, the Nissan and Hyundai VVTi, or even the Honda SOHC VVTi engines - maybe a reason for the HP/efficiency/refinement differences? As far as who owns who it really makes no matter, there is little in the Fusion that hasn\\'t been done before and it is anything but \\'clean sheet\\'. Maybe not such a bad thing - and maybe something that has contributed to the Fusion\\'s rather good initial and probable future reliability ratings...WHAT MISINFORMATION - is simply adding a rudimentary VVT system to an existing 10 year old engine make it a \\'new\\' engine, or taking an existing chassis stretching it a couple of inches make it a new chassis?If it makes you feel any better, Nissan is a champion at this kind of thing, taking a single chassis design (the FM), a single engine (the VQ) and turning it into a whole product line of \\'different\\' vehicles, all of which are anything but \\'clean sheet\\'. Guess you will have to put me on your Nissan \\'basher\\' list, even though I\\'ve bought 5 of their cars since \\'92, and if my better half has her way we will be making it six shortly.   Well, looks like Toyota is following Nissan\\'s footsteps to utilize its new 2GR-FE/FSE in most (if not all) of its new V6 models. It is definitely a good way to reduce cost and there is nothing wrong with that.Now, call me a Toyota basher... :P  when the 3.5L makes it to the Fusionsomeone somewhere in this forum posted an article about the 3.5 never making it into the Fusion, something about limited production capabilities along with a refit of 2 existing DT plants to produce a new \\'improved\\' 3.0 with a whole 240hp 2 years or so from now. Misinformation I guess :confuse: ?  The Ford \\'VVT\\' and please correct me if I\\'m wrong, is not the same sort of thing as the Toyota CVVTi, the GM CVVTi, the Nissan and Hyundai VVTi, or even the Honda SOHC VVTi Based on my understanding of it, you are correct. However Mazda\\'s VVT on the Duratec30 in the Mazda6 is similar to those above yet does not offer more power or efficiency. Ford seems to have found something else that allows for the extra power but at lower RPMs. You have to rev pretty high in the Mazda6 V6 to get to the power. Or at least I thought so when I owned one.  Once they upsize the engine that car could be a good seller. Its a nice size ride.The full-size 2008 Taurus (Five Hundred) is, I believe, supposed to get Ford\\'s new 3.5-liter V6 engine which will solve the power problem.I also believe FoMoCo is doing away with the CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) in the \\'08s in favor of the six-speed automatic. At least I think that\\'s what I read. Allen will correct me if I\\'m wrong on either count.  have no idea how old you are, but back in the stone ages we could put \\'grind\\' cams in our big ole V8s which would simply change the valve opening timing and duration realtive to piston travel to produce that nasty thing called HP - all at the expense of low engine speed behavior, that \\'loping\\' exhaust note that some of those \\'muscle\\' cars had. These newer high tech systems (much like what\\'s in the Toyota 2GR) take this principle several steps further - continuously adjusting intake and exhaust valve timing in response specifically to what a computer thinks the engine \\'needs\\' optimizing efficiency, HP, torque, and decreasing emissions. Last generation - this is a simple physical camshaft position change that generally occurs at higher rpm, in effect it is on or off, and likely responsible for that \\'kick in the butt\\' that you felt in you old Mazda.  The Ford 3.0L has variable cam timing on the intake side only. Some of the others have VVT on both the intake and exhaust. Ford is definitely leading the engineering effort for AWD. At least give them credit for that.  someone somewhere in this forum posted an article about the 3.5 never making it into the Fusion, something about limited production capabilities that argument has never made sense to me. Ford suffers from too much capacity, its part of the reason they\\'re loosing so much money. I know there are buyouts in the works, and plant closing planned, but as of right now they have plenty of excess capacity.  someone somewhere in this forum posted an article about the 3.5 never making it into the Fusion, something about limited production capabilities along with a refit of 2 existing DT plants to produce a new \\'improved\\' 3.0 with a whole 240hp 2 years or so from now. Misinformation I guess?Captain,What you said is what I\\'ve read, too, that the Fusion is going to get an \"improved\" 3.0 within a year or two (2009?) but not the 3.5.  Ford suffers from too much capacitythe 500 was originally supposed to have that 3.5 but Ford could not ramp up development or production of it for 3 years after promised introduction. The 3.0 by most accounts severely challenged in that application, no doubt - the car was a relative slug. I contend that, in effect, it was the 3.0 that killed the 500 and turned it into the \\'new\\' Taurus. Ford certainly had a whole bunch of capacity but may be constrained from closing more plants by existing labor agreements, so apparently they are forced to keep and refit plants to keep the UAW happy (conjecture on my part).  I didn\\'t say when it would arrive. I\\'ve heard about the PIP 3.0L but that hasn\\'t been confirmed yet. At some point the 3.5L is supposed to replace the 3.0L for all vehicles.There was a rumor of the Milan getting the 3.5L for Job 2 later this year but that didn\\'t make it into the order guide. Right now all the 3.5s are going to the MKZ, MKX and Edge.Ford is at least 2 years behind schedule with this engine. Not sure why but it would have been nice if it was here 2 years ago. I\\'ll give you that.  Again, we need to stick to the midsize sedans and go to Automotive News and Views to discuss Ford\\'s situation as a manufacturer.  I contend that, in effect, it was the 3.0 that killed the 500 and turned it into the \\'new\\' Taurus.Wrong again. The 08 update was already in the can when the name change came up. They had a name sitting on the shelf with 80% recognition and an existing name (five hundred) with only 30% recognition. It was a no-brainer. The idea was hatched by Ford Division\\'s new marketing guru, Barry Engle, following an exchange with a handful of journalists prior to the Detroit auto show in early January. Engle acknowledged to the press that he, too, thought killing Taurus had been a mistake. (He could safely say that, since he was far away, handling Ford\\'s marketing in Brazil, at the time.)The next day, Engle kicked the idea of a reincarnation up the ladder to Cisco Codino, the marketing group vice president, and Mark Fields, president of Ford North America. The trio took it to Mulally, who gave it an enthusiastic thumbs-up. The entire decision was made in a matter of days, according to Ford sources.  Sorry. I\\'m done now.  the Five Hundred is a car that I considered a coupla years back, had you put 260hp or so in it instead of 200, the car would have been an instant hit IMO and possibly now in my driveway, name recognition notwithstanding. The car is one well designed \\'space ship\\'.Under the assumption that the the 3.5 is more refined than what it is supposed to replace, the Fusion would be a rocket ship running the same sort of 6 second 0-60 times we see in some of the other cars in this group, and in my own estimation, would sell better so equipped - at least to those of us that are self admitted HP addicts. It is a shame in my mind that the Fusion V6, Sonata, and GM pushrod V6s find themselves competing against 4 banger Camcords (probably because of price) - for folks willing to make the \\'4 cylinder sacrifice\\' (and yes I expect some grief for this comment), fuel economy considerations are perhaps critical, thereby making the V6 models a tougher sell? Bottom line if Ford wants to sell a V6 anything as a V6, it needs to have that 250+hp if for no other reason then that is what everybody else is doing. Remember that it was Nissan that really started the HP race in this class (2002 Altima), joined shortly thereafter by Honda, and only recently trumped by Toyota\\'s efforts - the 3 cars sell over a million copies a year combined, and it is not Ford (or GM/Chrysler) that controls and dictates this market anymore.  Remember that it was Nissan that really started the HP race in this class (2002 Altima), joined shortly thereafter by Honda, and only recently trumped by Toyota\\'s efforts - the 3 cars sell over a million copies a year combined, and it is not Ford (or GM/Chrysler) that controls and dictates this market anymore.I find that comment to be as accurate as anything I have read about the mid-size sedan segment. And even though we own a 2007 Fusion, I\\'d make a sizable wager that statement will be true five years, maybe 10, from now.The mid-size sedan segment is the largest car group, per number of units sold, in the industry and the \"Big 2\" are Toyota and Honda in that order in the U.S. It\\'s a position those respective companies are not likely to relinquish anytime soon despite the best efforts of Ford, GM and Chrysler.  Last generation - this is a simple physical camshaft position change that generally occurs at higher rpm, in effect it is on or off, and likely responsible for that \\'kick in the butt\\' that you felt in you old Mazda. I\\'m with you on all of that. I just wasn\\'t sure exactly what was in the Fusion. Thanks for clearing that up. Oh, and I\\'m not old enough to remember those old muscle cars. In their heyday at least. :sick: That \"kick in the butt\" feeling in the 6 was EXACTLY like the feeling I got in our \\'96 VTEC Civic. I didn\\'t mind it in the 6 because it was a V6 but I hated the Civic\\'s lack of low end power.  These are some quotes about the DT 3.0 in the Mazda6:from car and driverWhen I drove a preproduction four-cylinder, five-speed Mazda 6 i, last fall, I came away impressed, yearning only for another 25 horsepower and a slicker gearbox. Yearn, and you shall receive. Instead of a couple dozen more ponies, Mazda added 60, courtesy of a 3.0-liter V-6. It has variable valve timing, and smooth and quiet power delivery reminiscent of a BMW in-line six\\'s.from automotive.comThe 3.0-liter V6 in the 6s greatly increases the fun. Like the four-cylinder, it has continuously variable valve timing (VVT) for its intake camshaft; but on the V6, this feature seems to be used more effectively, providing better low-down torque along with a willingness to rev, with good gas mileage and a nice set of sounds from the air intake and the dual exhausts.from motortrend:Mazda\\'s variable-valve timing sure brings Ford\\'s 3.0-Duratec to life. At part-throttle in the midrange, it almost feels like a light turbo.\" Another editor wrote, \"While it\\'s not as sweet and reedy as the Honda 3.0-liter V-6 and gives up a few horses to the Altima VQ family 3.5, it\\'s still a fine piece and fully competitive in this class.\"from AutoWeek:The exterior is a lot louder than the interior, though, where you need to eyeball the tach to see if the engine is running at idle, and the drivetrain doesn&#146;t even make a lot of fuss up near redline. Zings right up there, though, delivering a strong dose of performance&#151;after you get off the dime. from Esquire\\'s Best 10under50KThe secret of the 6\\'s appeal is in the details-the chunky feel of the shifter in your hand, the smooth, eager power delivered by even the base four-cylinder. Though this is a bread-and-butter family car, it\\'s clear that the people who tuned the steering and suspension care about driving. The 6 constantly surprises with its abilities. Go ahead, put five golf bags in the trunk. Somehow, they fit. This is the kind of car you name and keep driving long after it\\'s paid for. Maybe you could afford something else, but the 6 gets under your skin.from Car and Driver:Twist the key and blip the throttle to transform a quiet idle (at 40 dBA, it\\'s 5 dBA more hushed than the new Honda Accord V-6) into a feral snarl. Under way with the hammer down, there\\'s 76 dBA of baritone roar, the timbre of which suggests it originates in Yankee cubes rather than high-tech cams.  Most people buy 4 cylinders because they don\\'t need 6. They drive the 4 and it has all the power they need. You\\'d be surprised how many midsize sedan drivers never exceed 60% throttle, much less WOT. Why must you assume that everyone drives like you do?  Most people buy 4 cylinders because they don\\'t need 6.Well most people don\\'t NEED very much at all but look what they have. Ford is obviously not well represented at the horsepower club for midsize sedans. Spin it how you want but the HP game will continue and Ford will have to ante up if it wants to stay in this game. High horsepower doesn\\'t always mean you\\'re looking to drag race.  High horsepower doesn\\'t always mean you\\'re looking to drag race. In my area, it means you\\'re just looking to merge.   I would concur with that statement. I own a 2007 Camry LE 4-cylinder, and recently rented a 2007 Sonata GLS Premium 4-cylinder, and the Sonata was plenty fast enough for me on the DFW freeway system, and also very quiet. One of the most significant advantages to an Inline 4, other than fuel economy, is ease of maintenance. Ease of maintenance also equates to lower cost of maintenance in the long term.  High horsepower doesn\\'t always mean you\\'re looking to drag race.In my area, it means you\\'re just looking to merge.I thought you had a four cylinder?Still feeling ok btw? And have you gotten an estimate on your car?  Haha, I do have a 4-cylinder. The only time I\\'ve ever needed to really rev it up was to merge on short ramps.I\\'m feeling fine, thanks, and will pick up the wreck report tomorrow, after which I\\'ll begin the process of getting estimates. Thanks for asking, by the way.   I knew I would get somebody\\'s dander up with the 4 cylinder comment. And yes I have a basic misunderstanding of why we would want 160 hp and maybe 200 lb ft of torque even trying to pull around 3300 lb vehicles.Your point about \\'never\\' using anything more than 60% throttle is probably pretty close to accurate but not the point IMO. It is those times few and far between like safely and quickly merging onto a fast moving highway off a short on-ramp, or possibly making an easy pass of that semi on a 2 lane highway that can and do make a good V6 inherently safer all other factors equal. Power in reserve (within reasonable limits) is generally better than none or little. The question, to me, is whether that security and the generally smoother/quieter operation that a good V6 provides is really worth the mpgs they will invariably cost you. Yes, I currently own two cars both which will run in the 6s 0-60 - the number of times it actually is ever used damn few - do I feel better though with my wife in a car that provides that extra margin - sure do. BTW neither of us drive the way that you seem to think we must, licenses are too valuable, insurance rates are too high, and we are certainly too old for behavior like that.  A few grins once in awhile, when safe and even prudent, is not out of the question however and something I contend that anybody that truly enjoys driving will do occassionally.  Here we go again. If hp is so darned important then why do 4 cylinder camcords outsell 6 cylinder models 4 to 1?Since you guys like to quote sales numbers, let\\'s see how many V6 models are actually sold.Accord - 74K (20% of total 2007 projected sales)Camry - 93K (20% of total 2007 projected sales)Fusion/Milan - 88K (40%/59% of total 2007 projected sales)So the Fusion and Milan sell a lot more V6 models than the Accord and within 5K of the almighty Camry.No need to comment - the numbers speak for themselves.  So the Fusion and Milan sell a lot more V6 models than the AccordSo my Accord V6 is more rare than a Fusion/Milan. Interesting. I don\\'t base my decisions on what \"most people\" do.  Shame on them! Making money producing and selling cars - a novel concept, don\\'t you think?. The Toyota/Lexus 2GR, especially with the direct injection (FSE), IMO, is unequivocably the best V6 available in this class and likely even in the world right now. I own one as I know you do - I guess time will tell us if it has the same sort of longevity/durability as the reigning kingthat great Nissan VQ - oops my slip is showing (again) got one of those as well! I eagerly also anticipate Honda/Acura\\'s \\'new\\' V6 - now there is a company that knows about everything than can be done with smaller displacement engines, and shouldn\\'t be \\'allowing\\' Toyota too much time at the top.  hi guyshow would you rate sonata\\'s handling? someone just told me that last gen camry handles better than sonata. is that true? i rented many sonatas and drove many camry\\'s but i couldn\\'t honestly tell which cars handle better.if accord is 10 in terms of handling, is sonata around 8ish?  there are a couple of simple answers to this -1) cost - the Sonata, the V6 Fusion, and even the pushrod equipped V6 Malibus will price at about the same dollars as the Camcordima 4 bangers - getting a good \\'discount\\' on any car up front becomes a badge of honor (and ego gratification) for most new car buyers who somehow seem to forget the back end implications (those dreaded residual values) of those lower initial prices.2) FE - folks that buy vehicles in this class are generally more conservative types (none of these cars are \\'sports cars\\') and are therefore more likely to put a much higher value on those extra mpgs.  the Sonata has quite a bit more body lean than the Accord, but the brakes are a bit better than the sub-standard Accord brakes :surprise:  . Steering feel is a toss up I think, but I drove them several months apart so I can\\'t be sure. But I remember both feeling pretty positive. I liked the Honda\\'s seats a lot better though...the Sonata felt like I was sliding around too much in cornering. Also felt the Accord\\'s seats were just more comfortable to my hamstrings. As for the Camry comparison, I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever driven one...but all that I\\'ve read suggests the Camry is on the soft and wobbly side.  And the Fusion won a Stragic Visions award for its \"inferior\" interior.. :P  It is well known the Fusion has a 221HP V6, vs the 240 or 260 in the Accord or Camry. It all looks good on paper. but if you look at the 0-60 numbers.. I really don\\'t think the average car buyer is really going to notice 1 second.. ya think? They will however notice the $3,000 - $5,000 price difference however.. Its up to the buyer if its worth it ... :shades:  \"that\\'s easy - something in the neighborhood of a several hundred thousand Camcordima buyers \"Once again.. obviously you don\\'t know the majority of Cam/Cords sold are 4cyl.. :surprise:  \" However, I wouldn\\'t mind to recommend Fusion to anyone that wants a \"relatively\" inexpensive midsize yet offers good quality fit-n\\'-finish and decent performance.\"Forgot to add above average reliability and one heck of a value!.. No, really.. I have never claimed the Fusion/Milan to be the best vehicle around. I do however claim both of these vehicles deserve a look and a test drive and a serious consideration when shopping..   \"I\\'m simply tired of people making negative statements without any basis in fact just because they don\\'t like Ford.\"ME TOO.. Can you tell??   If I had to choose between the Camry and Accord, I would have to choose the Accord. I just can\\'t get over that frontend of the Camry.. its just plain weird looking.. Once again.. OPINION... before all the Camry owners come unglued...  I test drove both and I felt the Sonata would be a 9, Camry a 10...  really?! you\\'d put the camry on the same handling level as the Accord?  So, to paraphrase your answer - HP isn\\'t important for the majority of midsize sedan buyers. Exactly my point.  you\\'d put the camry on the same handling level as the Accord?I\\'ve owned both and their handling attributes are diametically opposite. The Camry has a looser, dampened suspension that provides minimal road feedback, but also isolates the driver from the road.The Accord is a tighter set up. More of a go-cart feel. Yea - you feel at lot more of the road but you also are more tuned in to the drive of the car. Steering feels more direct too. The 4 cyl engine (awesome) seems to redline quicker than the Camry.I prefer the Accord\\'s attributes. Maybe when I join AARP that\\'ll change, but ya gotta hang on to those vestiges of youth.  I didn\\'t say that all - but I will agree that unfortunately many buyers treat the V6 as a generic item in a midsize sedan - a serious mistake IMO there are a few in this group that only meet the definition, and there are others that are really good sophisticated engines. A car enthusiast will know, understand and appreciate the differences, your \\'majority of midsize sedan buyers\\' are really wanting only a good reliable appliance - there is nothing wrong with that. In my own case, I would enjoy a good 4 banger (Honda\\'s comes to mind) long before I could tolerate a DT or one of those GM pushrods. Different strokes for different folks, but your inference seems to be that since the Fusion sells more V6s than Honda it must somehow be better (or at least equal to) - a ludricrous stretch because there is simply no comparison in power, efficiency and/or refinement -it is only a function of how cheap the Fusion is relative to the Accord. The Sonata is the one that is at least in the same neighborhood in that respect and they too sell far more V6s again as a function of how cheap they are. Give me a choice between a Sonata and a Fusion, the Sonata gets my bucks - Hyundai has been doing some good things lately.  but your inference seems to be that since the Fusion sells more V6s than Honda it must somehow be better (or at least equal to)Um, he can speak for himself, but what I thought he was saying was simply that there are a lot of people who don\\'t care (or don\\'t even know) that the Fusion\\'s hp is less than the other two.Now can we get off this merry-go-round? I\\'m getting dizzy.   no, the average buyer won\\'t really notice that extra second or so - but he/she should notice how it feels and sounds getting there as well as the few bucks they likely save at the pumps, and they would also likely notice that the Camcord is probably worth that same $3-5k more at trade-in time. More truth to the adage that \\'you do get what you pay for (or don\\'t pay for).\\'  I was referencing post 1935 actually.  \"...but if you look at the 0-60 numbers.. I really don\\'t think the average car buyer is really going to notice 1 second.. ya think?\"If they won\\'t notice that V-6 A is a second slower than V-6 B, they probly won\\'t notice V-6 A is a second faster than 4-cyl B. So why bother with the V-6 at all?See how I didn\\'t bash any brand. The whole HP numbers game just plays into the the marketing depts. They want you to care about HP so they can create a demand and hence more profit.Look at a Lotus Elise. It will embarass most any car on the road - with a Toyota 4-cylinder engine. HP is not all that matters.  Look at a Lotus Elise. It will embarass most any car on the road - with a Toyota 4-cylinder engine.You mean the midsize sedan called the Lotus Elise? Actually a 4cyl S2000 will easily embarass a Lotus Elise. High HP while maintaining decent fuel economy is what most of these cars offer.  Ford is definitely leading the engineering effort for AWD. At least give them credit for that.I think Subaru should get the nod for AWD engineering in this class. Ford is a little late to the party in comparison to Subaru.  But to point, an S2000 engine in a Honda Accord would be \"negatory\" good buddy. The S2000 engine makes no torque, but has high revs. In the S2000 it\\'s great, the same engine in the Accord would be a disaster.   Has anyone seen this article yet?Definitely a gutsy move by Saturn...  That sure is a lot of confidence. As you said, Ghost, gutsy.  Good for them. GM is really trying to reinvent itself bit by bit and climb out of the hole they are in. Ford, OTOH... I give for a decade before it\\'s also sold off like Chrysler was.  I give for a decade before it\\'s also sold off like Chrysler was.I fear that you may be correct but I hope that is not the case.  Sounds like GM\\'s version of the Ford Challenge. Good for them.Everything that\\'s wrong with Ford is being addressed by Fields and Mullaly. So far they\\'ve made the right decisions for Ford\\'s long term health. No reason to think they won\\'t keep it up.  Definitely a gutsy move by Saturn... Not really, considering a huge amount of the CamCord\\'s appeal is from its reputation as a long term pleaser, and the showroom can downplay or mute this trait.   To me, this seems like a HUGE risk. I would never consider an Aura over an Accord or Camry. I recognize that this decision is not based on objective qualities, but on personal experience and bias.I am so biased that it would take either a giant price difference or some super-surprising features and possibly a much longer warranty to sway me. I cannot imagine changing my mind. Perhaps they so strongly believe in their product that they think a side-by-side could make me consider the Aura? (just visiting, not hosting)  In my opinion this is an excellent move by Saturn, and I suspect they will see some increase in sales as a result. This is light years ahead of the \"Fusion Challenge\" because I beleive this will actually get some more people into Saturn showrooms (heck, I have one a mile away that I\\'ve never been to, and I\\'m thinking about going just to check out the spectacle). You\\'ve got the fairly basic models of all three cars, comparable in *sticker* price (the one flaw is that Saturn won\\'t budge wheras the Japanese usually will), and they can showcase all of the awards the Aura has.Plus if they really do \"pamper\" the customers I\\'m thinking it will get some people all worked up. Additionally, unlike the Fusion challenge, the people who get all excited during the test drives will actually be able to buy an Aura right then before the excited feeling wears off.I\\'ve never driven an Aura; I\\'ll report my experience.  Bingo! You hit the nail on the head and that is my thinking also. I am biased for a reason however, and am entitled to war those those biases proudly.Unless someone wants to give me a car, I intend on keeping those biases. :surprise  gutsy, but not a surprise. one problem you have when your at the top, everybody is gunning for you. Ford, Nissan, GM, Chrysler, Hundai, ect are all tageting 2 vehicles. the accord and the camry.  Like people won\\'t smell a setup here. They can do all sorts of things to the Camry and Accord to make them seem less appealing. 1. loosen a few screws here and there to create some rattles. 2. Disconnect an O2 sensor, so the Check engine light comes on. 3. You can bet they won\\'t be using the top of the line models. 4. Whatever models they use will have drastically inflated stickers on the windows. The competitors have been shooting at the Camry and Accord for 15 years or more now, and they will miss the target again with this obvious ploy.  1. loosen a few screws here and there to create some rattles.As much as I love my Hondas, I gotta say I think the factory does this for you :P  I bet they will be standard models. The idea is clearly one of \"look, this car is 90% as good as these - it\\'s a very small difference. But check out the prices - we\\'re thousands less and have aggressive financing specials...\"It\\'s why Lexus ate into Mercedes sales. Close to the same thing for a lot less money(well, at first... now Lexus is silly money as well)  There is absolutely no way they will tamper with the Accord or Camry. That is legal and marketing suicide. If you can get over the hype, and blind brand loyalty, there are reasonable alternatives to an Accord and Camry. I should know, I own both a new Toyota and a new Hyundai, and Accord/Camry fans probably don\\'t want to hear my comments.  I own both a new Toyota and a new Hyundai, and Accord/Camry fans probably don\\'t want to hear my comments.The CamCord fans might not want to hear your comments but this Fusion owner does. Are you going to say the Hyundai is better in some respects? Is it a Sonata?  Wouldn\\'t it be funny if people visiting the Saturn showrooms try to buy the Camry or Accord. To be sure Saturn (GM) has got to be buying the Camrys and Accords because Toyota or Honda certainly isn\\'t going to \"loan\" them cars for purposes of the demonstration.  will probably just lease them. but It sounds like a decent idea to me. What have they got to loose? As someone else said, it will all be about price. I doubt many people will actually test drive the accords or camrys, this is just a way for the salespeople to put the two cars next to each other and say \"does it realy look like its worth x thousands of dollars more?\"  Very interesting discussion on GM\\'s Accord/Camry tactic. As an aside, I\\'ve recently had the pleasure of renting a Altima [EDIT] 2.5S and driving a couple hundred miles in it, back and forth between NYC/NJ/Philly.First, let me say that this vehicle\\'s glaring omission is its lack of standard ABS. In a rainstorm yesterday, this becaming frighteningly apparent on the NJ TPK as I had to jab the brakes quickly due to rubbernecking, and the front tires locked-up momentarily. As if a Taco Bell lunch needs further encouragement through my digestive system!Crisis adverted, no drama ensued, but still.. it\\'s practically the 2008 MY, this vehicle costs $21K at MSRP, and ABS is minimally expensive nowawdays, so what gives, Nissan?That aside, this car is fantastic. Sure, I\\'m still not convinced by the fuzzy, cheap felt on the outer edges of the seats, but that\\'s so easy to overlook given the interior\\'s many other virtues, from a super-easy to use trip computer, to well placed dash vents and logical climate controls. And the base stereo is even pretty decent (though I like the Camry\\'s trap door for the iPod better than the Altima\\'s jack). Additionally, seating is comfortable, passenger room copious, and steering wheel easily customizable for drivers of various shapes and sizes. Finally, all buyers get the simple but totally trick Intelligent Key? Sweet!Where this car shines though is in its ultra-responsive and smooth (especially for a 4) powertrain. The CVT is worlds above those offered in Dodge/Mitsu products, and this 2.5L feels nothing if not 3.0+ litres in size. I\\'ve even gotten an indicated 25 MPG since rolling out of the Enterprise parking lot, despite lots of sitting in traffic and, shall we say, liberal throttle applications when not.Handling is as one would expect given Nissan\\'s pitch of the Altima; composed and engaging. Kudos.Seriously, pending crash scores, I can\\'t imagine why this vehicle wouldn\\'t be on the shopping list of buyers in this segment. This is, far and away, the 4 cylinder that I\\'d pick. Make mine with ABS and the Convenience Package, though (which really does add convenience, btw, as the power driver\\'s seat likely cures some of the limited flexiblity between the standard seat\\'s incline and slide detents)Heck, I\\'d take this 4 over the V6 iterations of the Sonata and Fusion, too. I haven\\'t driven the Altima V6, but it would be a tough call between this and the Camry SE V6 or the Accord V6s (due to their tremedous value right now and general competence despite age). If I wanted lux, I\\'d probably go Camry XLE V6, though.IMO, if Nissan continues cranking out winners like this, Shift 2.0 will be nothing short of phenomenal. (To bad the new Sentra works to contradict this).my .02~alpha  renting a Altima 2.0S There is no Altima 2.0S  hey Alpha, did you get a chance to drive last year\\'s Altima? Did the handling improve - particularly the steering feel and \"boatish\" feeling? I did like their v-6 a lot with more low end torque. But ingress and particularly egress was not too easy from what I remember... anyway, thanks for sharing.  There is no Altima 2.0S He did later in his review point out that the engine was 2.5L in size. Probably a typo unless he actually drove a Sentra 2.0S? :confuse:   and Accord/Camry fans probably don\\'t want to hear my comments. Sure we do.  This is just another \"Challenge\", and will be as effective as the Fusion and Hyundai challenges have been. Are their sales increasing since they started the Challenges? I don\\'t think so.The way to increase sales of your own car, is to make a BETTER CAR. Talking bad about the other guy doesn\\'t work.  Probably a typo unless he actually drove a Sentra 2.0S?I was thinking the same thing. The latest Motor Trend picked it second to the Civic and ahead of the Elantra. Looks good to me too.  This is, far and away, the 4 cylinder that I\\'d pick.Nissan does build a nice 4 cyl, but I\\'d venture to say the next incarnation of a four cylinder from Honda in the 08 Accord will not only easily match it, but also provide the overall Honda fit and finish that closes most deals at a Honda dealership.  Are their sales increasing since they started the Challenges? I don\\'t think so. . So much misinformation. So little time.Ford April 2007 sales press release:Following the start of the successful &#147;Fusion Challenge&#148; ads in January, the Ford Fusion posted double-digit sales increases throughout the first quarter.Fusion sales for 1Q07 when they ran the ads were up 33% over 1Q06. 39,678 for 1Q2007 vs. 29,845 for 1Q2006.There goes that theory.  Perhaps. But of the four cylinder midsizers one can go out and purchase today, I\\'d choose the Altima. ~alpha  \"Fusion sales for 1Q07 when they ran the ads were up 33% over 1Q06. 39,678 for 1Q2007 vs. 29,845 for 1Q2006\" does not form a correlation between the ads and Fusion sales, it merely states concurrent events. Further were sales to consumers, and not to fleet? Ford has been doing good with this in terms of the FuLans, but I still have seen many at airport rental lots.Finally, I found the Fusion challenge annoying because it didn\\'t seem to be as apples to apples as possible. Did Ford not feel confident enough in fielding the FWD version of the Fusion? Since all the bar graphs that Ford chose to place in its ads had to do with either 1) styling or 2) performance, was Ford uncomfortable in providing a Camry SE with its different suspension settings? ~alpha  I don\\'t think it\\'s a risk at all. GM must do something to make buyers actually compare the Aura to the Accord and Camry and show them how well the Aura stacks up. This is as good a way to do it as any.I expect what Saturn is doing is pitting the Aura against like-priced Camrys and Accords. That would mean, for example, the V6 Aura vs. a relatively bare-bones Accord/Camry I4. I have done just this sort of comparison at my local auto show, and IMO the Aura looks very good in this kind of comparison. For example, it has large, nice-looking alloys vs. (probably) plastic covers on smaller wheels on the Camcord. It has the V6 vs. the I4. It has a much classier looking exterior I think, and the interior compares well, at least to the extent someone would compare them on a showfloor. You also have other plusses with the Aura, including OnStar and the hassle-free buying experience Saturn offers (not to be overlooked for many buyers tired of what they have experienced or heard about shenanigans by Honda and Toyota salespeople).So I think it\\'s a good move by GM--even if it means that Honda and Toyota just sold nearly 500 cars each in June.I\\'d like to see Hyundai try this with, say, the Santa Fe, RAV4, and CRV, or maybe the Elantra, Civic, and Corolla. Or more on topic, the Sonata, Camry, and Accord. Before the new Accord comes out, preferably.   No-way, the Accord will easily out handle a Camry..  \"would also likely notice that the Camcord is probably worth that same $3-5k more at trade-in time. More truth to the adage that \\'you do get what you pay for (or don\\'t pay for).\\' \"Better be worth 3-$5K more at trade in... You paid $3-5K more at purchase..   If you don\\'t see the correlation then you just don\\'t want to see it. Even the dealers said the ads were bringing in more buyers.Fusion fleet sales are holding steady around 18% last time I checked. They are NOT dumping cars into rental fleets. Instead they\\'re slowing production to match demand instead of throwing huge amounts of cash on the hood. Even the slow selling Five Hundred never got huge rebates like it would have in the past. The days of rental fleet dumping are over.Having AWD was the main point of the Fusion challenge - you can get an AWD Fusion V6 for the same price or less than the FWD competition. If Toyota wants to do their own test with a SE model - go right ahead. But if they had used the SE model then everyone would have complained that the Fusion was better equipped since it was a top of the line model.  \"Finally, I found the Fusion challenge annoying because it didn\\'t seem to be as apples to apples as possible. \"Here we go again..The fact is you can buy an AWD Fusion SEL V6 for the same price or less than a V6 CamryXLE or Accord EX. Read the comparison please. \"Comparable prices\". The Fusion will still our perform a Camry SE in the twisties. So I guess the Accord/Camry having stability control standard has no merit?? :confuse: Ford was a SPONSER only. Ford funded the comparison. These were everyday people/consumers. Not mag writers that have to make sure they keep the masses of readers happy or they will lose readers=revenue. That is what made this comparison an eye opener.   I just purchased a Sentra 2.0. S + luxury package. It comes with ABS, EBD, trip computer, heated mirrors, bluetooth, etc, etc, for a very decent price. I am getting 35 MPG on my horrible 40 mile, 1 hour and a half commute that has 50% stop and go. What is there not to like? (yeah I know, it\\'s not very sporty, has a soft suspension but is very roomy and quiet).  Today I was at the store and happened to be getting in my car when an Amethyst (Purplish/black) brand new Fusion SEL V6 AWD drove past me. The person driving was a woman about 30ish. I pulled up behind her and started a conversation about the Fusion. She was surprised I had mine for a year and was very interested how I felt after a years ownership.. Nice color check it out on the web..  Better be worth 3-$5K more at trade in... You paid $3-5K more at purchaseOh it will. And the percentage of its original value the Accord will keep is huge compared to a Ford.You seem to forget about that part of the calculation.  Im still wondering whopaid $5k more for an Accord. Mine was about $2k more than a comparable Fusion, and the numbers should have only come closer together since two years ago when I got the car.  Percentages are for those who don\\'t really understand numbers. As an extreme example (but the percentages apply :P ) : buy a car for $20K and turn it in for $12K (that\\'s 60%) and it cost you $8K depreciation. Buy a different car for $16K and turn it in for $10K (that\\'s 56.25%) and it cost you $7K depreciation. The first car retained a higher % of it\\'s original cost but cost $1K more in REAL dollars. Do percentages pay your expenses or do you pay them with dollars? Another example of percentages not being real: If you make $200 a week and get a 50% pay cut for a month, you\\'d get $100 per week. Then the situation improves and you get a 100% pay increase, which restores you to the original $200 per week. The dollars are the same but the percentage minded people would be inclined to think you were better off with a 100% increase after suffering \"only a 50% temporary cut.\"  Nissan does build a nice 4 cyl, but I\\'d venture to say the next incarnation of a four cylinder from Honda in the 08 Accord will not only easily match it, but also provide the overall Honda fit and finish that closes most deals at a Honda dealership.leadfoot: you keep talking like you\\'ve got some crystal ball or some inside contacts at Honda! Stop it! I like Honda too, but I don\\'t think everything they touch turns to gold... look at their stringtrimmers or even the ridgeline or ElementSC or RDX or RL or lack of braking power on their Accords. Why don\\'t we just talk about what we know and not what we hope we know.  \"Oh it will. And the percentage of its original value the Accord will keep is huge compared to a Ford. You seem to forget about that part of the calculation.\" Have fun banking the percentage. My bank only works in dollars. Seriously - adwriters must love us (colectively) consumers. They can use numbers/statistics that are at best irrelevant, or at worst misleading, but if they sound good we eat \\'em up.  I\\'d look at real world private party sales and forgot the percentages. For example, in real dollars IMO the Accord will hold it\\'s value better than the Fusion. Meaning that after three years, the purchase price minus the sales price will be greater for an Accord vs a Fusion. Thus contributing to a lower cost of ownership over the time period.  But that\\'s based on the fleet queen Taurus. Huge incentives and rental fleet dumping is what hurts resale values and we have neither case with the Fusion. Automotive Lease Guide puts estimated Fusion resale in between Accord and Camry. Accord will probably be slightly higher because of its reputation but I don\\'t think the gap is as high as the Accord fans think it will be.  Better be worth 3-$5K more at trade inand if we make the assumption that it will be (while Ford has had a checkered past in the residual value dept, we simply don\\'t know yet about the Fusion - the Camcords OTH each have about 20 years or so of great residual values), then that Camcord really only costs about $200.00/year to own than that Fusion - that $200.00 \\'average\\' interest you pay on an extra $4000.00 per year - keeping in mind that the principle difference will also narrow because your payments are obviously higher and that loan principle difference reduces with time. Is it worth an extra $20/month to drive an Accord let\\'s say - that is buyers choice, but it is also a cost that you might also recover just in the FE differences.The Accord actually a cheaper car than a Fusion, quite possibly - and I\\'m not the only one that thinks so - check out Intellichoice and Edmunds numbers. This logically the ultimate justification for those that go out and spend the extra money on a Camcord - but also one with a very solid historically supported foundation.Over the longer term, of course, that differential will always shrink in the cheaper car\\'s favor and then we are all reduced to a bet of sorts - on the long term reliability and repair costs on one car vs the other, and again we can all point to 20 years or so of history versus a whole 2 as we all seek to make the best \\'bet\\' we can. Folks that point to initial purchase price can sometimes justifiably point to some great discounted and/or mfgr sponsored \\'deal\\' they think they got, but the fact of the matter is that initial purchase price is only one of several components of what it truly costs to own a car. Harp on the price differences all you want, but in all likelyhood, it means very, very, very, little   Have fun banking the percentage. My bank only works in dollars.Does your bank give you a range when they talk about a cost to you? Do they say that fee is $3000-5000 dollars? Have fun figuring that debit out on your statement.My point is that although you might pay more for the Accord the accumulated depreciation on it when you sell it (expressed as a percentage that has been proven - not a number I made up) is less than that of any other sedan in this class.Yes - I\\'ll take that to the bank in actual, exact dollars and not in a firm possibility of a definite maybe.  Actually there was an article in the fleet newsletter I get talking about how the cost to rent a car has been increasing due to the cut backs in fleet sales from the big 3. The Autoline Detroit guy said the residuals for GM cars went from the low 30s to mid 40s (and GM attributes that to fewer fleet sales and a better warranty program).  think about this for a second -while it is true that Ford has avoided dumping the Fusion thru the fleet sales depts., resale value market perceptions will always largely be governed by what people think the the brand name as a whole. Example - you are going out to buy your kid his/her first car, and you tell your neighbor that you bought an 6 year old Camcord with 100k on it. He nods because he understands. Tell him the same thing about a Contour in the same condition and he wonders if you are crazy. The fact that the 1 and 2 year old rental fleet Taurus can be bought for 10-12k or that they are floating 6 grand+ on Crown Vics can do nothing but hurt a Fusion\\'s resale values, simply because the Taurus/CV are cheapening the brand name as a whole.It is perhaps unfair, but for the last 10 or 15 years at least - Toyotas and Hondas are assummed reliable and valuable while the \\'Detroit\\' products are assummed \\'suspect\\'. Ford (and Ford buyers) will have a long time to wait before this changes - even if the Fusion proves to be the most reliable and best car ever built.  we can all point to 20 years or so of history versus a whole 2 That assumes nothing has materially changed in recent years. Based on history you wouldn\\'t have predicted Toyota\\'s engine sludge or transmission problems or Honda\\'s transmission problems. You wouldn\\'t have predicted the new Toyota Tundra 5.7L truck engine would have 20 confirmed camshaft failures within the first 6 months.At some point you have to stop relying solely on past performance and take current performance into account. Things change.  I usually rent thru Hertz or Budget, would invariably end up with a \\'Vulcan\\' Taurus/Milan, or a G6 pushrod - talk about irritating! Then it seemed that Sonatas were taking over, most were the V6s and not nearly so bad. Hyundai apparently has also seen the light (as declining \\'sales nos. would indicate) and now seems to understand that \\'loss leaders\\' are exactly that and \\'sales\\' for the sake of \\'sales\\' is a losing proposition especially as they seek to recover from their own checkered past as well.  you have to stop relying solely on past performance and take current performance into account. Things change. and you really really think that the car buyer is going to magically flock into Ford dealerships just because the Ford Fusion has shown to have some decent reliability stats for a whole 2 years? Things do change - but it is also almost universally true that real change takes time. Has Ford all of a sudden changed its spots? Perhaps.  Don\\'t assume the general buying public shares your disgust for Ford and all Ford products. They don\\'t. And the ones that do are changing their minds based on the latest quality and safety awards.Yes, it will take time but it\\'s happening much more quickly than some folks want to admit.  and you really really think that the car buyer is going to magically flock into Ford dealerships just because the Ford Fusion has shown to have some decent reliability stats for a whole 2 years?Yes. That plus the recent quality and safety awards. I read an interview with someone who bought an Escape. She said she only visited the Ford showroom after seeing Ford\\'s great performance in the latest JD Power IQS ratings. Before she saw that she simply would not have considered a Ford product.I\\'ve also read about buyers who won\\'t consider a Camry due to the engine sludge and transmission problems. I\\'d say the shoe is now firmly on the other foot. Diehard Toyota and Honda fans won\\'t be swayed but the average buyer will be.  Accord/Camry having stability control standard has no merit?? actually if you understand what stability control does and how it works, the fact that the Fusion doesn\\'t even offer it is a big advantage -to the Fusion, under those controlled and specific conditions that Ford dictated the tests be conducted. Remember that we are talking about how much \\'fun\\' it is to fling a few sedans around a test track here - not how ultimately safe they are.We\\'ve been thru this before, but your \\'Challenge\\' remains about the biggest sham ever foisted on the car buying public. Ford should be ashamed to think that it has to resort to such things.  \"Sounds like GM\\'s version of the Ford Challenge. Good for them.\"No way, Ford challenge was a paid advertisment from Ford, while this is a gutsy move aimed at buyers in dealerships, not passersby. GM is definitely on move, the product they have launched in the past year of so has been far, far improved from the past (GMT900s, Saturns Aura-Vue-Sky, upcoming Malibu, CTS, Acadia, upcoming G8) and I don\\'t see why it won\\'t be successful. Ford on the other hand, well apart from the Fusion, there really is not much to talk about, I would have preferred if they had got some of the Euro fords here, which are excellent vehicles, including the small/micro cars, which would have been a great move, seeing how gas prices are skyrocketing here.  Example - you are going out to buy your kid his/her first car, and you tell your neighbor that you bought an 6 year old Camcord with 100k on it. He nods because he understands. Tell him the same thing about a Contour in the same condition and he wonders if you are crazy. Except you leave out that for the same money the camcord costs you can get two Contours. And why do I care what someone else thinks, anyway.I actually did buy two used contours that became teenager cars after I had used them myself for a while. Each had about 75K miles one was 5 years old the other 6. One cost $3800 the other $3100.  I have no \\'disgust\\' for Ford products and have said several times that I thought that both the Fusion and 500 were well designed vehicles - disgust? - that probably happens when I evaluate what\\'s under the hoods and drive them and is only a personal importance that I assign to drivetrain sophistication How much do you think Ford (or anybody else) PAYS the JD Powers\\' of the world to use their name for promotional purposes, BTW? Or for that matter, how much R&T or C&D were PAID for their \\'participation\\' and name use in your ballyhooed Challenge? Those quality and safety awards you point to need to be earned and not necessarily bought.Trust somebody like CR to come out with something that tells me that the Fusion has been the least troublesome car in its class for at least the last 5 years or so - then, I become a \\'believer\\'.  Additionally, seating is comfortableI guess it depends on who you are. I found the Altima\\'s seats to be awful. Too hard. too flat, and too low (despite the height adjustablity).  grad - I think you find that the bigger price disparities are found comparing V6 to V6, not the 4 cylinder models. The Accord V6 premium being higher than the Fords.  Now you\\'re insinuating that the JD Power results are bought and paid for?This is now past the point of being ridiculous. Time to move on.  Which spec/trim of Accord and Camry is GM/Saturn putting in their showroom?Does Honda/Toyota count those as sales   Does Honda/Toyota count those as sales Toyota and Honda are not loaning the Accords and Camrys to Saturn, they are not giving the cars to Saturn, they are not trading the cars for Saturns. The Accords and Camrys are being sold. Sold = Sale  and how exactly do you suppose that JD Powers pays its bills? They don\\'t exactly have the same sort of donation/consumer support base that CR does, for example.I think there is a strong possibility, the cynic that I am, that somebody over at JD (and I really don\\'t mean to pick on them specifically) gets together with his staff and decides which company needs and more importantly would use their name most often for some favorable publicity. Effectively predetermined results - just like the Challenge. All about dollars, sure, as many things are.If you don\\'t think that things like this happen, I feel sorry for you!  The Accord and Camry models used in the Aura promotion can be found here: Side-by-SideLooks like they used the MSRP as the main focus. That makes it a V6 vs I4 comparison.  JD Powers sells its research to the auto industry. The quality reports are only the tip of the iceberg. 99.99% of their data is never released to the public. It\\'s used by the automakers (all of them) to track progress and identify areas for improvement. That\\'s how they fund their research, not by selling results to the highest bidder. They get the same price for their work regardless of the results.You don\\'t ever hear any of the automakers at the bottom of their results questioning either the results or the process. That should be enough proof by itself.  The Accord and Camry models used in the Aura promotion can be found hereAre they gonna replace the 5 year old designed Accord with a 2008 version when it arrives in 3 months?  Are they gonna replace the 5 year old designed Accord with a 2008 version when it arrives in 3 months?In 3 months the advertising campaign will be over. There will be no Accord to replace.   Oh my... when you look at the specification details on these comparison pages, Toyota and Honda fans will have a field day. For example, the V6 is standard for the Aura but \"Not Available\" for the Camry and Accord. I guess that is true.... the V6 isn\\'t available in the I4 models.   Thanks for the post, TallMan. Very informative. Just as I suspected, the Aura is a V6 (do they even offer a 4?) versus the I4 in both the Camry and Accord. The comparison is definitely a gutsy move by GM. Comparison doesn\\'t indicate if all three of them have standard or automatic transmissions.  They would all have to be automatics because as far as I can tell, the XE model in the comparison doesn\\'t come with a manual.I was playing around on the Saturn website and it appears that the base model XE is what is used in the comparison (based on price). However, when I went to the \"build your own\" section, several option packages were pre-selected and I couldn\\'t remove them. This added $2,725 to the MSRP. Anyone know anything about this?... it certainly can\\'t be right.  Saturn doesn\\'t offer a 4-cyl for the XE or XR, only for the Green line. I\\'m sure that automatics will be used for the comparison as well, considering that the Aura isn\\'t available with a manual.As far as the website goes, I was able to build a bare-bones XE with no options, for the price of $20,995.  As far as the website goes, I was able to build a bare-bones XE with no options, for the price of $20,995.Maybe it\\'s my Safari browser then... I couldn\\'t get those check marks on the packages that were pre-selected turned off. I feel better knowing that you were able to do it. :shades:  Ah... figured it out. Their default interior is leather and I was just clicking away not choosing cloth. Leather requires those other packages.  You miss the point...a 4 cylinder IS the standard engine in both the Accord and the Camry. While a V-6 is available it is an option. On the Saturn it is standard and for the price a \"plus\" for many people and for the sake of this comparison I guess. I won\\'t lie, I have found the 4 cylinder engines on both the Camry (rented) and the Sonata (also rented) to be perfectly adequate...in a rented vehicle but when I am shelling out my own $$$ I want a V-6. This may be a vestige of my automotive formative years (the 60\\'s and 70\\'s) when BIGGER/MORE HP was better in all circumstances.  living in a closet? you really think that 99.99% of their income comes from these industry studies or that the cost of showing that picture of a trophy in an ad comes cheap? CR publishes exactly where their money comes from and how they use it and is non-profit, so how do you know anything is 99.99% of anything at JDP! A link would be appreciated. Objectivity is not something I question with something like CR although I don\\'t agree with their priorities a lot of times, simply for the fact that no money changes hands. Anybody that is in it for that money - that would be a different story, don\\'t you think? Last year\\'s favorite over there at JDP was Hyundai if I remember correctly (another mfgr. in need of an image remake), and Honda/Toyota would not likely find any real benefit to advertising something that most folks already know and expect. CR currently rates the Accord and the Altima tops in this category overall with the Fulans in the middle of the pack - and does not allow either Honda or Nissan to advertise that fact - amazing how that works is it?  Cost to run a brand new domestic vehicle 65K miles = almost 5,000 dollars in repairs (not maintenance) and tow trucks (4 of them) outside of warranty.Cost to run a new Honda 65K miles = $0.00 outside of maintenance and gas. Zero tow trucks.Cost to run a new Audi to 19K miles = $0.00 outside of gas. (Granted, its still under warranty and maintenance is covered to 50K or 4 years).Cost to run 1992 Honda purchased in 2002, kept for a bit over two years, bought at 166K miles; taken to 200K miles, bought for 3,500 + tax, sold for $2,700, Repairs = $1,000 which included new brakes, rotars, ect.So before I turn 30, I have about 115K miles of personal experience (including my wife\\'s with the 92 Honda Civic) with foreign cars... total repair cost 1K.I have 65K with a domestic... total repair cost $5K.Throw in the wife\\'s 25K on a 2005 Civic, and 4K on a 2007 Civic, and now you have 29K more miles at $0.00 repair cost. (\\'05 got totalled by some idiot).YOU DO the MATH!  That the \\'05 Civic recovered about 94% of its value in the not at fault accident that got it totalled. Insurance paid handsomely.If it was an \\'05 domestic... would of been lucky to get 50%?The old domestic got peanuts on trade-in at 65K miles... thereby adding insult to injury to the 5,000 dollars in repair costs; might as well have bought a RR with repair bills like that!  You miss the point...a 4 cylinder IS the standard engine in both the Accord and the Camry. While a V-6 is available it is an option.I didn\\'t miss the point. I just got a chuckle out of Saturn saying the V6 is \"not available\" in the Camry and Accord but, as you stated, it is indeed an option... or available in another trimline. Interestingly enough, Aura\\'s only available 4 cyl. Greenline is more expensive than their V6 XE base model.Saturn chose to compare their XE model, which is their cheapest, to a mid-range trimline in the Camry and Accord. To be honest, I\\'m not sure what models they are comparing to because they list two different prices on the Saturn pages.My best guess is that the Accord is the SE and the Camry is the LE with some options.  That kind of cross referencing trickery happens often with GM... I stated this in another forum.  Heh-heh... That\\'s advertising. Can\\'t say as I blame them but I have heard wonderful things about the Aura.My favorite part is the Dimensions tab. Saturn uses a red asterisk to denote \"Saturn Advantage\". Front Head Room, for example, is listed as:*Aura: 39.4Camry: 38.8Accord: 40.4Saturn Advantage! There are several more just like that on the tab.  so they assume people aren\\'t smart enough to see which number is advantageous?  Oh I don\\'t mind them pointing out the advantages, I just don\\'t understand how being in the middle is an advantage.   yeah it is rather amusing - how about the relative FE ratings, if you are going to trumpet the extra HP of that V6 and then conveniently \\'forget\\' to mention the several mpgs it\\'s costing in these days of $3/gallon gas. IMO though, a helluva car with the 3.6, the XR probably more directly competitive to the V6 versions of the Camcord. But, then again, maybe that \\'Saturn advantage\\' might just disappear. As you say, that\\'s advertising!  There is absolutely no evidence from anyone anywhere to suggest that JD Power\\'s quality ratings are up for sale or that they\\'re influenced by the mfrs in any way. Why would the auto mfrs buy their research data if it\\'s not accurate?   Why would the auto mfrs buy their research data if it\\'s not accurate?So they can put JD survey in their ads, and impress people who are swayed by that type of thing. Just about any car has won an award of some type. Some car companies will give themselves an award. Seems kind of interesting to me that most of the cars who proudly display JD power results in their ads are cars that don\\'t do well in other tests and comparisons (desperate types).I buy the car I want. Not the car some magazine, survey, or media says is the right car. The media doesn\\'t know what I like.  I have already shown who paid $5K more for a Camry.. go to the Milan vs Camry room and scroll back. In this room you will find a person paid $5K more for a like optioned Camry vs a Milan Premier V6.. I have told you this time after time..   some also don\\'t understand financing. Never has Honda or Toyota offer 0%, and very rarely 2.9%.. Financing costs also must be included in the price of the vehicle. :surprise:  Kind of funny, resale value has only true meaning when you can actually find someone to buy the car for the higher price. I have first hand experience with this with my wifes 2000 Accord LX 4cyl automatic.. Resale.. :P right..  I don\\'t know about your previous discussion but thegrad\\'s post you are replying to talks about $5K more for an Accord, not a Camry.I\\'m sure with at least one savvy shopper and one oblivious shopper, you could find someone, somewhere who paid $5K more for a Fusion than an Accord or Camry.   \"It is perhaps unfair, but for the last 10 or 15 years at least - Toyotas and Hondas are assummed reliable and valuable while the \\'Detroit\\' products are assummed \\'suspect\\'. Ford (and Ford buyers) will have a long time to wait before this changes - even if the Fusion proves to be the most reliable and best car ever built. \"Once again, this may hold true for those who don\\'t do thier homework.. As I have said.. Go to MSN reliability data and compare an 03 Focus to an 03 Civic.. Surprise! :surprise: Although you\\'ll get those who swear up and down Focus are unreliable and Civics are completly reliable. For my daughters first car it will be a Focus.. I\\'m not spending the extra $$ for perception and buying a Civic..I\\'ll be saving thousands over a Civic.  \"but your \\'Challenge\\' remains about the biggest sham ever foisted on the car buying public. Ford should be ashamed to think that it has to resort to such things.\"Sham, in your anti-Ford mind. These were comparable vehicles. These people were in no way paid by Ford, nor were they Ford employees. This is what makes the test so interesting.  I have already shown who paid $5K more for a Camry.. go to the Milan vs Camry room and scroll back. In this room you will find a person paid $5K more for a like optioned Camry vs a Milan Premier V6.. I have told you this time after timeThis is silly. There\\'s a sucker born every minute bro. I\\'m sure grad can find you an anecdote about someone paying MSRP for their Milan.Not sure why you feel compelled to foist this $5000 price difference on us. The $2000 extra you pay for an Accord is recovered when you sell it also. We have no idea what a Fusion\\'s percentage of its purchase price can be expected back at resale. A total unknown. Accord buyers known about the car\\'s resale history.Plus Accordians get a better car in the process.  \"No way, Ford challenge was a paid advertisment from Ford, while this is a gutsy move aimed at buyers in dealerships, not passersby. \"Wrong again.. It was sponsered by Ford. These people were not Ford employees, nor were they paid by Ford. Please, read the whole challenge before spreading misinformation.  These people were in no way paid by Ford, nor were they Ford employees. How in the world could you possibly know this? You don\\'t. And we know you don\\'t. Even if Honda did this kind of \\'challenge\\' I\\'d take it with a grain of salt. But ....they don\\'t have to resort to this ploy.  So, now JD Powers is being bought by Ford?? :sick: I would be willing to be if it were Toyota or Honda in the spotlight at JD Powers it would be completly believable right? Bias runs rampant in this room  \"Oh my... when you look at the specification details on these comparison pages, Toyota and Honda fans will have a field day. For example, the V6 is standard for the Aura but \"Not Available\" for the Camry and Accord. I guess that is true.... the V6 isn\\'t available in the I4 models. \"Ever thought an I4 Camry/Accord like optioned costs as much as a v6 Aura like optioned? Then it would be a fair comparison. Showing the consumer that the Camry/Accord are just plain over priced..   \"I\\'m sure with at least one savvy shopper and one oblivious shopper, you could find someone, somewhere who paid $5K more for a Fusion than an Accord or Camry.\"Actually.. a guy at work just bought an 07 Camry SE I4 automatic.. Price - $25,500!! He thought this was a great price at that!. I\\'ll wait a few days to pop his bubble..   Bro??.. I\\'m not even going to respond to this person..  These people were in no way paid by Ford, nor were they Ford employees. \"How in the world could you possibly know this? You don\\'t. And we know you don\\'t.\"How do you know they were then? READ the Challenge will you?? Or are you to afraid of the truth?  Let me know when you get to my post that states the 4cyl Aura costs MORE than their V6.We all know that Accords and Camrys cost more. However, since Auras are no dicker and the Camcords aren\\'t, cost is hard to compare in this case.  Ever thought an I4 Camry/Accord like optioned costs as much as a v6 Aura like optioned? Then it would be a fair comparison. Showing the consumer that the Camry/Accord are just plain over priced.. Well to be perfectly honest with you, the V6 in question is a pushrod design (dated) and gets thrashy and unrefined when pushed. So just to say that the camcords are overpriced on engine alone is not true. I would assume the I4 engines cost just as much or more to engineer as the Aura V6 (3.5L).  I\\'m not going to get into this again but some of us DID read the challenge. We also read the comments by those who actually were there... and some of the Ad publications, etc. I don\\'t have the links but I read a lot about it a few months ago. It was an AD campaign.  a Mazda6! Ok, maybe this is a creative interpretation, but I really do have 8 seats in my car in the pic below. Just that 3 of them happen to be office chairs. Try doing that in a sedan! Actually, try getting just 1 of these assembled chairs into a sedan (2 of the chairs pictured are fully assembled, one just had the back removed). Gotta love hatchbacks!   \"Wrong again.. It was sponsered by Ford. These people were not Ford employees, nor were they paid by Ford. Please, read the whole challenge before spreading misinformation.\"Scape, I don\\'t spread misinformation - you do, all the time, every time. Please go back and read and re-read the Ford Challenge; if you need english comprehension classes, let me know and I will set you up with a tutor. It was a Ford paid event that is used as an advertisment in all publications it features in, its not published as an article by those publications (do you know the difference? Let me explain; an article is what a publication puts out as its or the writer\\'s opinion based on tests they run, and advertisment is a paid write-up that the publication prints so that it can pay its bills and keep printing quality/core articles)You may want to spin it any way you want, but it was not a comparison test; just a way Ford invented to \\'win\\' since none of the known publications picked the Fusion as a first place finisher in actual comparos. Pure marketing, and I don;t fault them for it, but to tout it as a comparison - that takes the cake.I thought we had been through this, but you just keep spreading misinformation and misleading people by your deliberately false posts and then calling other people biased. The Saturn move is a true gutsy move, GM is targeting buyers with samples of Accord and Camry in their dealerships, not passersby. These people could as well pick the Accord/Camry after driving all 3, so to me it reeks great confidence by GM in its product, the Aura.   I am not denying it was an AD campaign, nor am I denying that Ford Motor Company sponsered this event. However, you have to find it kind of interesting that even though Ford sponsered the event, Car and Driver hosted the event, that none of these people were paid by Ford to say these things, nor were they paid by Ford to vote a certain way. Car and Driver was there as a host, a neutral party. These were everday consumers, not media, not \"experts\". Are you saying Ford somehow coerced these people into voting a certain way? or saying these things? With the reputation of Car and Driver on the line and Ford on the line.. I highly doubt it. Don\\'t you think one or more of these people would have gone the news if they were held at gun point to vote a certain way? :shades:  \"You may want to spin it any way you want, but it was not a comparison test; just a way Ford invented to \\'win\\' since none of the known publications picked the Fusion as a first place finisher in actual comparos.

I have already shown who paid $5K more for a Camry.. go to the Milan vs Camry room and scroll back. In this room you will find a person paid $5K more for a like optioned Camry vs a Milan Premier V6.. I have told you this time after time.. You don\\'t have to chastise me scape. The post I replied to spoke of the ACCORD, not the Camry.  Showing the consumer that the Camry/Accord are just plain over priced.. If that were the case, there wouldn\\'t be 800,000 Accords and Camrys sold this year. There\\'s more to a car than a spec sheet.  Manual A/C, cloth seats. It appears to be something along the lines of an LX Accord, possibly EX 4-cyl. Nice to see a manual tranny!  Are you saying Ford somehow coerced these people into voting a certain way?I told you I\\'m not getting into this again. I read more than just the comparison.  Try doing that in a sedan! Actually, try getting just 1 of these assembled chairs into a sedan (2 of the chairs pictured are fully assembled, one just had the back removed). Gotta love hatchbacks! Why would I wanna do that when I can easily just put them into my minivan and still seat 5 people. Who puts all this junk in their car anyway? Get a truck.Plus with hatchbacks, you get to have all the stuff you\\'d normally have in the trunk and out of the way, right there in the car with you. No isolation. No thanks.Nice photo anyway.  \"Never has Honda or Toyota offer 0%\"Flat out wrong. I paid x dollars for a Toyota. With 0% financing the OTD cost was x dollars financed, with my payment being x/36.  Car and Driver was there as a host, a neutral party. These were everday consumers, not media, not \"experts\". Are you saying Ford somehow coerced these people into voting a certain way? or saying these things?Its amazing to see you just accept what Ford purports as the truth without a hint of doubt. Again I\\'d be skeptical if Honda did the same thing, altho they don\\'t need to arrange that kind of stunt.Kinda like 4 out of 5 doctors prefer X. Sure. When you finally find the 4 out of 5, you can stop your experiment and make your assertion as being true.  I post real data and all you guys can do is dream up conspiracy theories and ridiculous JD Power bribes which can never be proven. How convenient. I guess Ford sabotaged all the Camry engines and transmissions, too.  Why would I wanna do that when I can easily just put them into my minivan and still seat 5 people. Who puts all this junk in their car anyway? Get a truck.Well that\\'s the point... with a hatchback, most of the time I don\\'t need a truck. And since I don\\'t want to pay for a truck nor the insurance for it, I don\\'t have a place to put one, and wouldn\\'t want to drive one unless I absolutely had to, it\\'s great having a value added feature that helps me get more out of a midsize car than those who only have 4 doors and a trunk. To me, given that a hatch can look as good if not better than a sedan, it seems to me that the design of a sedan wastes a lot of space.Besides, this was not a planned pick up of these chairs. I was running through the office, and noticed all the office people with new chairs and these 3 month old ones sitting in the warehouse. If I didn\\'t grab them then, they\\'d be gone. I\\'ll post em on Craiglist, make a quick $150, and that\\'s that. But if I drove a sedan, these chairs would be in a dumpster or someone else would have sold them. Plus with hatchbacks, you get to have all the stuff you\\'d normally have in the trunk and out of the way, right there in the car with you. No isolation. No thanks.You must be one of the Sopranos... no worries for me; no smelly dead bodies in my trunk. Either that or you keep too many things in your car. I\\'d hate to hear what it sounds like when you have to brake suddenly!  \"some also don\\'t understand financing. Never has Honda or Toyota offer 0%, and very rarely 2.9%.. Financing costs also must be included in the price of the vehicle\"It has been my experience that vehicles with 0% financing incentives take a hit in resale value that is equal to or even greater than the savings in finance charges. Think about it, if they have to use heavy incentives to sell a vehicle when new (I\\'m talking both about big customer cash rebates and 0% financing deals) then the car isn\\'t likely to be in huge demand on the used market, either.  re 2060Good show.. yep, hatchbacks are great. Just wish there were more of them available. Seems like them and the station wagon have almost been replaced with SUV\\'s or whatever the latest name is for them. I am hoping they make their return soon. I think they definitely fill a need for the average family, without having to buy or rent other vehicles from time to time. van  I agree that hatchbacks have great utility, but I don\\'t like having all the contents of my trunk now in my car. A sudden stop and you\\'ve got your golf clubs etc. in the back seat. Bags of mulch, pine straw, sandy beach towels - nice to have all that stuff stashed away in a trunk.  I didn\\'t say that at all - another case of you jumping to conclusions. What I said was that JD Powers like some of these other survey companies, are indeed profit making organizations and do receive a fee for use of their name in advertising ventures - so therefore, any award that any mfgr. gets should be deemed suspect. So let\\'s look at the situation as it exists today or it did a little while back when Hyundai \\'garnered\\' a few of these awards, the mfgrs. that certainly need to tout their improved reliabilities etc. invariably end up receiving these awards and the ones that don\\'t (and yes, Honda and Toyota would be good examples) don\\'t. Amazing the way that works, isn\\'t it?Money has power, doesn\\'t it? As I said earlier, as soon as your Fusion starts winning anything from some organization that is NOT in it for the money, and statistically shows a LONG TERM improvement in the reliability, improves what they put under the hoods - then I take notice. All I can do is try to turn the lights on in your closet, though, I can\\'t get you out of it.As far as your touted challenge goes, anything that is \\'sponsored\\' or \\'staged\\' by anybody that would stand to gain by the result is the most obvious opportunity to abuse what otherwise must be true. This kind of thing happens in a lot more than just car tests. Give me a properly selected population sample (probably out of the Orient) and I can find a whole bunch of 2 pack/day cigarette smokers that happened to all live into their 80s or 90s, thereby \\'proving\\' my contention (I do, after all, work for the American Tobacco Institute) that smoking increases life spans, this after I conveniently ignore the fact that the Marlboro man died of lung cancer a while back. Ridiculous enough?How about if I worked for Ford and needed to come up with something that I could use to promote our new Fusion?Well, maybe the first thing I might do is go grab \\'a random group\\' of folks that have been \\'Ford families\\' for years, as you apparently are, wine and dine them, get them appropriate exposure to a good salesman, and then pick three cars that by any definition aren\\'t equal and compare them under specific tests and conditions that are designed to accentuate the virtues of one vs. the others, while again conveniently ignoring those tests that don\\'t. Ford (or anybody else) is NOT going to spend the money for a comparison like this without KNOWING what the results are at least likely to be. How far they actually went to insure it, beyond the specific models and test types selected, you and I both don\\'t know. In any case, results of any sort of \\'sponsored\\' event should be given zero creedence. And that would include \\'comparisons\\' run by Honda and Toyota, if and when, they are reduced to such tactics.  I think I responded to this months back, but a distant friend of the family got a \\'07 Camry SE I-4 automatic early this year for $21,100 (not including tax). He was really happy with the price he paid, and said it was close to invoice.I don\\'t know the details though, but one person is not a real good sample!!!Getting back to the topic, I do know that he stated he and his wife looked at a \"lot\" of different cars in this class and liked the Camry best, FWIW.  Not an issue. Most (if not all) hatches have a hard divider (like a parcel shelf) that divides the trunk area from the passenger area when the hatch is closed, and opens up with the hatch. It effectively seals off the trunk area, but is removable for the larger items.The ol\\' hatchback isn\\'t what it used to be. It\\'s more of a car with a proper trunk these days, but with a larger cargo capacity and much-larger (and easier, IMO) access.  Good post, captain...What I would like to find out more about the \"Ford Fusion Challenge\" are:1. What kind of car do those 500 people currently own. What\\'s their history of buying cars.2. What are their choices before the test3. What are their choices after the test4. What type of test track did Ford set up? Is it AWD-biased?5. Is the 0-60, 40-70, and 1/4-mile tests included? If not, why?6. I know Ford used V6 Camry and Accord but are they the loaded version? I know the AWD Fusion that Ford used was a loaded one.Before those information are being released, this \"Ford Fusion Challenge\" is bathroom, toilet-side entertainment at best...  6. I know Ford used V6 Camry and Accord but are they the loaded version? I know the AWD Fusion that Ford used was a loaded one. Accords don\\'t have options, they only have models. VP,LX,SE,EX,EX-L,EX-L-Nav,LX-V6,SE-V6,EX-V6,EX-V6-Nav,EX-V6-6spdSince it was a V6 Auto, it is an LXV6,SEV6, or EXV6. I think the difference is sunroof or not, and a few minor things people are unlikely to notice in that type of exposure. The equipment seems pretty comparable. I am not as familiar with Toyota\\'s models and packages.  Lousiwei, you are wasting your time with this; everyone knows (including Scape deep inside) that this was an advertisment campaign, not a comparison test. Ford also calls it an avdt campaign that has worked for them, so its difficult to understand how Scape calls it a credible comparison. Since it is an advertisment, why would Ford include any parameters that the Fusion was not at the top in?You want comparisons, look for publications that do this for a living or look at real people buying these cars. CD and RT did not validate this advertisment as their opinion (as they wouldn\\'t with any advertisment in their mags)....CD and RT have a lot of advertisments in their magazines, does that mean each of the advertisments is blessed as an opinion by them?  Good post, captain.AGAIN, the biggest problems with the Fusion Challenge (besides not being an objective comparison test) is that the questions were very limited in scope, and the survey respondants were NOT VOTING with their CHECK BOOKS.Why didn\\'t they include questions on perceived quality? Comfort? Brand reputation / past experiences with the brand? Of course, they limited the survey to the questions they could win (handling with AWD and styling).The Fusion is a better handling car than the Accord. I also think it is an attractive car. If I had participated in the Fusion challenge, I probably would have voted the same way most of the other participants did. However, ask those same participants to evaluate the cars on ALL of aspects, and choose which one they would BUY for themselves, and suddenly the outcome changes.  You want comparisons, look for publications that do this for a living or look at real people buying these cars.Here\\'s the problem - name ONE publication that will take several hundred average everyday buyers and do this type of comparison test. They won\\'t. It cost too much. So all we ever get are opinions from automotive journalists who all have their own individual biases and performance data that the average buyer could usually care less about.Show me a published comparison test done by a third party that involved hundreds of average, everyday drivers. Never happened - never will. The only point that should be taken from the Ford Challenge is that the Fusion is competitive with the Camcords when compared head to head by average, everday buyers. The publicity around the IQS awards should get more people to actually look at the Fusion and other Fords instead of blindly crossing them off the list. We\\'ll see if that translates to a sales increase.  Don\\'t matter to me. This vehicle will be kept until it falls apart.  \"Here\\'s the problem - name ONE publication that will take several hundred average everyday buyers and do this type of comparison test.

You want to talk about hundreds of drivers, well just look at the real byuers - more than 800k per year vote with their wallet for the Camcords, isn\\'t that saying something?On the Fusion, I have never debated that it is not competitive with the Camcords ot other midsize cars  Financing only matters in the price of the vehicle if you are financing it. There is no law saying you can\\'t just pay the whole thing off at once. If you bought a Honda instead of a Chevy, you might actually have the resale value to pull something like that off!  The only point that should be taken from the Ford Challenge is that the Fusion is competitive with the Camcords when compared head to head by average, everday buyersAkirby - what I doubt, in effect, is that these were \\'real\\' people (or everyday buyers in your words) in the sense that they weren\\'t \\'pre-qualified\\' by Ford in the first place. If it was me establishing the \\'rules of engagement\\', I would sure as hell make sure that was the case. And no, I don\\'t know either way this happened but nor does anybody else, so therefore those \\'real\\' people and their opinions must be taken with a small grain of salt. In terms of available information of REAL consumer preferences? Well, we do have something about 7 Camcord buyers for every 1 Fusion buyer, don\\'t we? As far as \\'crossing any of these cars\\' off the list, probably not a good idea when any buyer is spending 20 grand or more of his/her hard earned money!  Why didn\\'t they include questions on perceived quality? Comfort? Brand reputation / past experiences with the brand? Of course, they limited the survey to the questions they could win (handling with AWD and styling). I think they did actually.This should answer your questions and those by others regarding the Fusion and Aura challenges going on now.   MSN Reliability data is about as reliable as an emailed offer for winning $1,000,000 for filling out a short survey that will only take 3 minutes!MSN Reliability data also claims the Dodge Neon to be reliable, but everyone that has owned one or known someone that owned one knows otherwise!  The Ford challenge was indeed paid for, sponsored, concocted, conceived, and advertised by Ford!If that doesn\\'t tell you it was rigged I don\\'t know what does!!! I don\\'t care what Ford writes about the Challenge. Don\\'t believe everything you read! Consider the source!  MSN Reliability data also claims the Dodge Neon to be unreliable, but everyone that has owned one or known someone that owned one knows otherwise!My experience is counter to that point.  With the reputation of Car and Driver on the line and Ford on the line.. What reputation does Ford have? Car and Driver might have a small reputation and following as a magazine. But, Ford? They have a BAD reputation at best.  I wrote unreliable instead of reliable.... so does that mean you agree with me the Dodge Neon was never reliable, thereby making MSN seem foolish?  MSN Reliability data also claims the Dodge Neon to be unreliable, but everyone that has owned one or known someone that owned one knows otherwise!Very true. My wife\\'s car is a good example.She has a 2000 Dodge Neon. She bought it new, and drives it over 17K miles per year. It has close to 108K miles on it now, and has been rock-solid reliable. Besides a dead battery, it\\'s always started. It\\'s burned out a foglight and tail light, and it\\'s on it\\'s third set of tires, but other than regular maintenance, and a new set of brake pads and rotors, it\\'s been nearly flawless.The only problem is that her struts in back are shot, and need to be replaced, but since she wants a new car this summer, she\\'s perfectly content on driving on bad struts until then.  But we\\'re now veering quite a bit off-topic, and c\\'mon... let\\'s let the shroud remain wrapped \\'round the mystery of the validity of the Ford Challenge. No one in here knows, and I think we\\'ve exhausted that topic, if not other members There are quite a few models mentioned in the discussion header. Any chance we can inject some new info/comparisons rather than staying on the Fusion/CamCord merry-go-round? All the cool kids are doin\\' it...  I agree that hatchbacks have great utility, but I don\\'t like having all the contents of my trunk now in my car. A sudden stop and you\\'ve got your golf clubs etc. in the back seat.As long as I keep the back seats up and don\\'t pile things up beyond the height of these seats, nothing is flying anywhere. When I had to take my mower to get serviced, the Mazda6 has some tie down loops in the cargo area to make sure things weren\\'t rolling around. Plus they have an collapsable organizer that has smaller compartments to keep little things like groceries in its place. Take a look at the pic at the bottom.Bags of mulch, pine straw, sandy beach towels - nice to have all that stuff stashed away in a trunk.I always make sure I keep plastic bags in my car so that I\\'m not making a mess. And even if I had to put something big and dirty back there, I got the cargo mat with raised lips which comes out very easily so I could rinse it off. Having all this utility that was well thought out was a great bonus to me over just having a fun and comfortable vehicle... seems Mazda really thought through how a bigger space could be used and how to make it more efficient.   Interesting article baggs. However, I didn\\'t read in it more information about the design or methodology of the surveys. If they did collect and analyze more data, I never saw it published or advertised. The survey results I saw from Ford were short and overly simple. \"Did you like the handling (or styling, or driving feel, etc.) - Yes or No?\"Ford admitted in the article you referenced that they discovered that people drove the Fusion and liked those attributes (handling, styling, etc), but still bought something else. So why would they focus only on those attributes? Why emphasize those in the Fusion challenge advertising? Winning those attributes alone aren\\'t enough to overcome Honda and Toyota.They need to find out why people appreciate those attributes in the Fusion but still keep shopping (as I did). My guess is, if they did collect data on perceived quality and brand experience, they didn\\'t like what they saw.Ford may be on the right track with the recent quality improvements- however, whether that will translate into better LONG-TERM reliability and higher future resale values remains to be seen.  I have found a lot of utility in having a class 1 or class 2 hitch installed on my vehicles. This has served me very well. The overwhelming majority of the time, if there is something connected, its a hitch mounted bike rack, and almost any car in this class will have no problems towing a 5x8 uHaul trailer or similar.I am a big fan of second hand furniture (I can\\'t bring myself to drop $2k on contact-paper/veneer over pressboard when I can buy older real wood furniture for much less) and because most private sellers don\\'t have a delivery service, I usually end up with a small utility trailer behind one of the cars. The Subie can tow 2700#s, and that towing capacity is more than the payload capacity of many SUVs, and when I am not towing, I get 30mpg.  My guess is, if they did collect data on perceived quality and brand experience, they didn\\'t like what they saw. I think that is exactly what the opening paragraph tells us. It\\'s pretty obvious why they would not want to publish such data in an ad.However, I didn\\'t read in it more information about the design or methodology of the surveys.I doubt the surveys were too complex. Probably 10-20 questions asking the basics. Anyone who looks at their published results in the ads, mainly the bar graphs, will notice that the Fusion didn\\'t beat the Accord by much in the three categories they tout. Therefore I wonder if those are the only three categories it did win in. Perceived quality and reliability surely lost based on that article and I\\'d be curious to know what other questions they asked and what the results were.I\\'m a Ford guy and always have been so they don\\'t need to convince me that their vehicles are competitive. But ads like the Fusion challenge and whatever they come up with for the latest IQS awards will certainly change some minds and if nothing else, plant a seed. They still need to provide water and sunlight for that seed to really change people\\'s perceptions though.  This should answer your questions and those by others regarding the Fusion and Aura challenges going on now.That link, Baggs32, was a very informative news story. We\\'ve owned our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion for about six months and have never been invited to participate in any survey.We are extremely satisfied with our purchase. The car has had zero problems, not so much as a single squeak or rattle. The fit and finish are perfect. Our only complaint is in-city gasoline mileage but even that is now approaching the revised EPA estimate of 17 mpg city.It\\'s pretty obvious that this a forum dominated by Camcord supporters and that is OK, too. A difference of opinion makes the world go \\'round. Camry and Accord are No. 1 and No. 2 in sales in the mid-size market but that does not mean that the new Fusion and new Aura are not worthy competitors. They certainly are, in my book.I think FoMoCo and GM are wise to adopt hood-to-hood advertising methods because smart mid-size sedan buyers should be well-informed before they make a choice.  Why would I get an underpowered Fusion when I can get a more powerful and economical 5 year old designed Accord? Furthermore, in about 5 more months the 2008 Accord will blow by all of its competitors.  I thought we were supposed to stop the Ford bashing and Honda cheerleading.  AND the Honda bashing & Ford cheerleading. Let\\'s leave ALL of it for now, please, and move on to some other topic of conversation.  an Aura for 24 hours by myself to take it on a SERIOUS test-drive?  >an Aura for 24 hours by myself to take it on a SERIOUS test-drive? You might try renting one from the various rental companies.  Man that\\'s a big area. Can\\'t wait for my 6i hatch to be made. Now it turns out build date won\\'t be until July. Not that I\\'m surprised by delay! Anyway hopefully in August I\\'ll get the car.  We are extremely satisfied with our purchase.Wow - that buyer\\'s remorse from a day ago has disappeared?  Wow - that buyer\\'s remorse from a day ago has disappeared?Did I really say that we had buyer\\'s remorse? Actually, in a way, I do wish we had bought an I4 Fusion instead of the V6 with AWD, since we don\\'t \"need\" either but the car is indeed very satisfying. Our only \"complaint\" has been the in-city mileage, but that is gradually improving and we only have 3,400 miles on the car.  Financing only matters in the price of the vehicle if you are financing it.If it is discounted a lot, it can still matter to the (would be) cash buyer (such as myself). When I compared prices, if there was 0% financing that had a value equal to what I would earn in a tax exempt money market fund by taking the loan, rather than paying cash. Currently if I were buying a $20,000 car, 0% for 36 months would be worth maybe around $1200.  and in my case (don\\'t know if it\\'s still the case now), Mazda gave me an extra $1000 rebate to finance through them. I did not get a great rate (7+%) but I paid off my car in a few months w/ other lower interest loans. So sometimes financing makes more financial sense than not.  Furthermore, in about 5 more months the 2008 Accord will blow by all of its competitorsJust like somebody else might make a statement like the 08 Fusion that is presumed to have the new DT 3.5 will blow off all its competitors - how do you KNOW what Honda is going to do? I have yet to see anything but some car show pictures and nothing in terms of engine specs, FE ratings etc.. A logical assumption, I think, that the new Accord will at least have to get up into the 270hp territory to match the Camry and Altima, anything much more than that may create a little torque steer overkill much like the TL-S. How could the new Accord \\'blow away\\' the competition? How about a 170hp+, 350 lb. ft. high tech clean diesel that gets 30+ mpg EPA combined? They would have an instant 6 month waiting list and probably be able to price it accord-ingly (pun intended)!   Just like somebody else might make a statement like the 08 Fusion that is presumed to have the new DT 3.5 will blow off all its competitors -Captain2,According to what I have read, the 2008 Fusion will not have the new 3.5-liter V6. FoMoCo is sticking with the tried and true 3.0 liter V6 in the 2008 Fusion.  I know that Honda will blow the doors off of the competition because that is exactly what they did in the fall/winter of 2002 when they introduced the 2003 model Accord. Lightyears ahead of the competition at the time.I chose the LX V6 because you get all the goodies except leather and a sunroof.  Yes, I\\'d have paid cash but took Mazda\\'s $1000 for getting a loan I did not need. I paid mine off after three weeks. I paid about $60 in interest and a $4 lien filing fee...so it was actually a $936 rebate for me  .  I do wish we had bought an I4 Fusion instead of the V6 with AWDI\\'d rather have the V6 in the Fusion vs. the 4. I know the gas mileage isn\\'t the best but I\\'m sure you\\'ll get more quality miles on the V6, in better comfort, road security, comfort, on demand power, and resale.  here\\'s a few reasons to choose a Fusion over the Accord... the steering on the fusion is quicker and has more feel in comparison to the heavy feeling steering of the accord. the suspension and chassis on the fusion makes the car feel lighter and a bit more tossable, although the accord does have a good feeling chassis...it just feels heavier and less direct. and of course the brakes on the accord have been tested to be pretty lackluster and in some cases worst in class. personally, I\\'d rather have an engine that was a few tenths slower to 60 than 15 feet shorter to get back to 0 mph; at least in an emergency stop, the fusion would be more likely to avoid an accident. then of course, we could talk about the looks... personally I think the Fusion is pretty striking, and not too far out there like the Altima (at least the taillights) whereas the Accord is not offensive or anything, but isn\\'t a standout either. AWD is another reason to like some versions of the Fusion... although I don\\'t have AWD on my mazda6, I did have it on my Legacy and it was valuable in more than just bad weather. when driving at anything more than 20mph, grip and traction is always a good thing and anything that helps improve this can either be safer or more fun. And of course the recent reliability reports in consumer reports and jd powers seem to confirm that the Fusion is holding up amongst the best of all automobiles. These are all good reasons to consider the Fusion over any car. Would I buy one though? Nope, I\\'m quite happy with my Mazda6.  Yes, I\\'d have paid cash but took Mazda\\'s $1000 for getting a loan I did not need. I paid mine off after three weeks. I paid about $60 in interest and a $4 lien filing fee...so it was actually a $936 rebate for me .AAAARGH...my dealer told me that I had to hold on to the loan for at least 3 months or else the rebate would be taken back! Oh well, my net was around $740 which still isn\\'t so bad. I hate slimy dealers!  Always read the fine print!  And of course the recent reliability reports in consumer reports and jd powers seem to confirm that the Fusion is holding up amongst the best of all automobiles. Get back to us in ten years and let us know how the Fusion did. In the meantime, we know how an Accord will do.  we know how an Accord will do.No, you think and hope you know how well an Accord will hold up. Just like stocks and mutual funds...past performance does not guarantee anything. I like Honda engineers also...but look at their formula 1 cars; they are in last place right now despite spending 500 million a year. Honda engineers are great, but they are not infallible.And we\\'ve all been talking about JD powers and consumer report\\'s long term reliability studies... they both are confirming studies that show that the difference between one brand and another usually does not exceed 1 extra problem over a five year history. I understand you want to make a mountain out of a mole-hill to justify the extra expense, but really, the differences are not huge. Most of the cars that are in this category are very well made.  Why should we assume that the passersby in the advertisment are unbiased folks? You want to talk about hundreds of drivers, well just look at the real byuers - more than 800k per year vote with their wallet for the Camcords, isn\\'t that saying something? sales numbers are meaningless. Ford sells 5x as many F-seris trucks as honda sells accords. does that mean trucks are better than cars?  Personaly, I consider reliability rating fairly worthless. I guess they may be a good guide, but they don\\'t, and can\\'t factor in how well somebody takes care of their car. You could even go as far as to say that part of the reliability problem for lower priced cars is that many of the people who buy them are less well off, and it\\'s the most they can afford for a car. Lower income car buyers with less disposable income are far less likely to get all the proper maintanece performed on their car. Its akin to why vehicles that are \"dumped\" into fleet sales get lower reliability rating. the drivers dog the hell out of \\'em. Its not that the car is inferior, It\\'s that the drivers abuse them.To all those who ask, how will that fusion be in 10yrs, I know how my accord will be, I\\'d say1. I\\'d be willing to bet you an accord that a fusion (properly maintained) will have about the same amount of problems as any accord, camry, altima ect2. Honda is every bit as capable of screwing up as anyone else. Nissan (nor its customers) foresaw an engine problem in the fist month of 2006 production that would destroy sales of the sentra and altima for the entire year. (the sentra still hasn\\'t recovered) It was that unexpected, (and uncommon with nissan) mistake that contributed the most to honda passing nissan in sales last year.  I know that Honda will blow the doors off of the competition because that is exactly what they did in the fall/winter of 2002 when they introduced the 2003 model Accord. Lightyears ahead of the competition at the time. The 03 Accord was not light years ahead of the midsize competition, lets not forget the then new Altima was available, as was a new Camry. So at best the Accord was competitive, but not light years as you mention.  \"And we\\'ve all been talking about JD powers and consumer report\\'s long term reliability studies... they both are confirming studies that show that the difference between one brand and another usually does not exceed 1 extra problem over a five year history. I understand you want to make a mountain out of a mole-hill to justify the extra expense, but really, the differences are not huge. Most of the cars that are in this category are very well made.\"That depends on what exactly that one problem is... my brand new 2004 Ford had 10 problems in 3 years and 45k. Some of them were relatively minor, such as the rear door lock actuator failing, making the door difficult to open from the inside. Others were more serious, such as transmission work at 9,000 miles (which still did not solve the problem).If that \"1 extra problem\" means a breakdown/stranding or even an expensive out of warranty repair, that\\'s a little more than a mole-hill, at least to me.   In the meantime, we know how an Accord will do.So you were expecting the tranny problems they had a couple of years ago with the V6 copies then? Since there was no recall I\\'d imagine trannies are still failing here and there. :P  Good post. I agree 99%.   sales numbers are meaningless. You\\'re not a salesman, are you? You\\'ll never be one with that attitude.  Ford sells 5x as many F-seris trucks as honda sells accords. does that mean trucks are better than cars?That\\'s because for many many years people had very limited choices when it came to trucks. It is the last thing domestic companies have to hold them afloat. You can bet they are worried about the bigger and better Japanese trucks coming into the market now. Is it the beginning of the end?  sales numbers are meaninglessYou gotta be kidding....  If that \"1 extra problem\" means a breakdown/stranding or even an expensive out of warranty repair, that\\'s a little more than a mole-hill, at least to me.Yes, but you assume more than you should. Where is the data that suggests that extra problem is one that would strand a person? There is some info on CR as to specific probs, but unfortunately I have not seen other sources supporting these findings. Given that CR pulls data only from a small unrepresentative sample of the population, I hesitate to read too much into their conlusions unless the differences are drastic (red dot vs black dot). And again, the differences between brands are minor over a five year period in most of these cars in this segment in problem areas that would leave a person stranded. And when it comes to probabilities of that one extra problem being minor (one that does not require emergency and immediate service) are far greater than the chances of having a major problem (since the amount of minor problems far exceed the amount of major problems that can happen in a car). So not only is your argument assuming the worst without citing any evidence to support your assumption, but it would also seem the odds of having a minor problem far exceed the chances of having a major problem. So yeah, it\\'s still a mole-hill.  Accords don\\'t have options, they only have models. VP,LX,SE,EX,EX-L,EX-L-Nav, LX-V6,SE-V6,EX-V6,EX-V6-Nav,EX-V6-6spd Since it was a V6 Auto, it is an LXV6,SEV6, or EXV6. I think the difference is sunroof or not, and a few minor things people are unlikely to notice in that type of exposure. The equipment seems pretty comparable. I am not as familiar with Toyota\\'s models and packages.The different models come with vast differences in equipment levels and prices.The differences in SE-V6 and EX-V6 are as night and day as LX 4-cyl and EX-L 4-cyl, and their $4,000 difference in MSRP reflects that. It isn\\'t just minor stuff. it\\'s leather, heated seats, auto climate control, black plastic trim vs. wood/alumininum trim, etc...I don\\'t consider leather, heated seats, and auto climate control to be unlikely to be noticed, or \"minor,\" but that\\'s just me.  So you were expecting the tranny problems they had a couple of years ago with the V6 copies then? Since there was no recall I\\'d imagine trannies are still failing here and there. There was a major TSB and a warranty extension, covering all transmissions in 2003 and 2004 V6 Accords that failed within a massive number of miles (100k maybe?). You made it sound like Honda didn\\'t cover their customers, when the did in fact do so.  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. said Thursday it will spend $68 million to add 3,400 Toyota Prius hybrids to its fleets by 2008. And Avis Budget Group Inc. said this week it plans to make 1,000 hybrid Prius vehicles available for rent as early as next week. Enterprise Rent-A-Car also operates a fleet of more than 3,000 hybrid vehicles...Chee, the automotive analyst, said the rentals offer Toyota Motor Corp. a chance to showcase the Prius, as well as give potential buyers a chance to decide if a hybrid is right for them.\"I do think it\\'s a risky move for Toyota, because what they\\'re saying is: \\'Here\\'s the car, here\\'s how it drives, we stand by our power train, and we think it\\'ll win people over,\\'\" Chee said.Hmmm, sound anything like Hyundai\\'s big move into the rental/fleet segment a couple years ago and subsequent cut back?Do the same standards for criticism of Hyundai Sonata rental/fleet sales apply to the Toyota Pious?  Do the same standards for criticism of Hyundai Sonata rental/fleet sales apply to the Toyota Pious? I guess it depends on the ratio they dump into fleet sales. If it is a massive number like Hyundai did, then the Prius\\' value will drop. If they keep it limited to a few thousand per year (say, less than 6k) then there shouldn\\'t be much of an issue.  So you\\'re saying Accord\\'s relatively few problems with a few of their transmissions in one model year (which of course were replaced under warranty) somehow diminishes their reputation for outstanding quality over 20+ years of American automotive acceptance?Their record of quality compared to Ford\\'s isn\\'t a fair fight for Ford. The American consumer has showed that.When the Fusion (will that be the car\\'s name in 4 years or will Ford change it?) can rack up the successes of the Accord, the world will be stunned.I wouldn\\'t hold your breath.  There was a major TSB and a warranty extension, covering all transmissions in 2003 and 2004 V6 Accords that failed within a massive number of miles (100k maybe?). They were failing early on grad. It didn\\'t take them 100k+ miles to fail.You made it sound like Honda didn\\'t cover their customers, when the did in fact do so.  I never said that. However you and others blow by this tranny problem like it was nothing. Most recalls from Ford, GM, etc. result from small numbers of part failures so why didn\\'t Honda recall their tranny too? IIRC the tranny failures weren\\'t of the \"my car won\\'t go in reverse\" nature, but rather the \"holy cow my wheels just locked up at 75 mph on the highway\" nature. Recalls can be voluntary and a lot are. Honda didn\\'t do everyone a favor by extending the warranty. Only replacing those trannies would have made owners safer. And it wasn\\'t just the Accord that had this problem either as you probably well know.  \"more than 800k per year vote with their wallet for the Camcords, isn\\'t that saying something?\"Answer me why does the Camry finish LAST in the consumer reviews above? These are actual owners of Camry vehicles, not 1 \"expert\".  So you\\'re saying Accord\\'s relatively few problems with a few of their transmissions in one model year (which of course were replaced under warranty) somehow diminishes their reputation for outstanding quality over 20+ years of American automotive acceptance? Nope, that\\'s not what I\\'m saying. I\\'m saying that every mfr has it\\'s share of problems if you look deep enough for them. Tranny failures are NOT something you brush under the carpet IMO. The playing field has been leveled. Get used to it and let that breath out now. :P Furthermore, Ford, GM, and all other mfrs replace faulty parts under warranty. Why point out that Honda did too? It\\'s not like they did anything any other mfr would have done. :confuse: Heck, Ford extended the warranty on the last gen Focus\\' powertrain to 100k miles just to show everyone that it was still a good car despite all of the nagging recalls.  Answer me why does the Camry finish LAST in the consumer reviews above?Because it doesn\\'t excel at anything but rather does everything very well. The same reasons the Explorer and Escape sold so well for Ford.  \"what I doubt, in effect, is that these were \\'real\\' people (or everyday buyers in your words) in the sense that they weren\\'t \\'pre-qualified\\' by Ford in the first place. \"This is a laugh! Don\\'t you think Car and Driver would have caught wind of this if Ford hand picked these people? Car and Driver was a neutral party. Can\\'t you just live with the Fusion won in this challenge? The difference here is that it is not just one \"expert\" with a magazine that has to keep the sales up and make the masses happy. These are everyday consumers. This is the reason why Car and Driver was there in the first place, ya think? Ford sponsered/paid for it. I would no doubt agree with it being a lopsided challenge if Ford did it by themselves.  \"MSN Reliability data also claims the Dodge Neon to be reliable, but everyone that has owned one or known someone that owned one knows otherwise! \"Funny, I know 3 people with Neons and they all say they are fine.. :surprise:  \"The Ford challenge was indeed paid for, sponsored, concocted, conceived, and advertised by Ford! If that doesn\\'t tell you it was rigged I don\\'t know what does!!! I don\\'t care what Ford writes about the Challenge. Don\\'t believe everything you read! Consider the source! \"Where does Car and Driver fit into this then? So, whan the Accord wins first place in the media, we are not to believe it?  This is going back into the \"Let\\'s Talk Media\" discussion again. This Ford commercial stuff is getting REALLY OLD around here, and doesn\\'t really benefit the discussion of the actual cars, does it? The dead horse is bruised and bleeding...Maybe we can carry it to Let\\'s Talk Media?  Styling wise.. Park a Fusion side by side with an Accord or a Camry. The Fusion makes these other 2 look plain frumpy.. The Ford sales person was so confident he actually drove the Fusion to a Honda and a Toyota lot and we compared the cars side by side for about an hour each car. This was a dealership that offered about 8 different car brands along a long strip of roadway.  \"Get back to us in ten years and let us know how the Fusion did. In the meantime, we know how an Accord will do.\"Dejavue again.. I hear this same story over and over again. I heard it when I bought my Escort in 1991, My Ranger in 1996, My Escape in 2001.. all had high miles and ran great at sale. Game over, news flash.. Honda/Toyota no longer have the reliability arena cornered..   Park a Fusion side by side with an Accord or a Camry. The Fusion makes these other 2 look plain frumpy.Not to me. The Accord\\'s LED taillights add a touch of high-end car, while the Fusion\\'s mirrored taillights are just a bit too boy-racer to me, like a ricer\\'s 8 year old Civic or 12 year old Accord. Personally, I don\\'t want my ride \"pimped.\" The high rear deck also limits rear visibility.Style is completely subjective, and isn\\'t really quantifiable.  I agree there. Reliability isn\\'t nearly the concern it was 15 years ago. I\\'d still avoid Chrysler (watched my father get burned twice by them), but any other company would be heartily in the running with me these days. They\\'re all getting good/better with each year it seems.  \"Their record of quality compared to Ford\\'s isn\\'t a fair fight for Ford. The American consumer has showed that. When the Fusion (will that be the car\\'s name in 4 years or will Ford change it?) can rack up the successes of the Accord, the world will be stunned. I wouldn\\'t hold your breath.\"Yep, no-way, no how will Ford Motor Company, or General Motors EVER build a car to match a Honda or Toyota.. Good Grief... :sick:  Don\\'t worry, we don\\'t all feel that Ford will never make a comparable car to Honda, Toyota, etc... Ford had quality problems, but 2007 quality is not the same as that in 1977 or 1987 (or even 1997), and people are realizing that.Ford Fusion didn\\'t meet my needs, but that doesn\\'t mean it was an inferior vehicle. This, coming from a Honda owner.  3400 Hertz plus 1,000 Avis in the next six months, plus however many Pios\\' Enterprise has, and it looks like much more than 6,000 units on an annualized basis. We know it\\'s 4400 units from now to the end of the year just for Hertz & Avis. Additional Enterprise units? We could be looking at over 6,000 units before January, 2008.P.S. That\\'s about $20K per copy (about $1K less than invoice), what are dealers getting for these cars?  what are dealers getting for these cars? Beats me. I never shopped for any hybrid, much less a \\'Yota.  I don\\'t know either, I was just posing a question (in response to many prior posts) about how rental/fleet sales cheapen the value of a car. But, obviously, your 6K target is on the low side.  Have to agree with you. My last two Sebrings have had problems. One thing Chrysler still does well - their V6\\'s get excellent fuel economy. Both the Sebrings were used for business travel and both delivered 30 - 32 MPG running 75 on the interstates with the 2.7Liter 200HP engine. Regards:OldCEM  \"Yes, but you assume more than you should.\"I thought I qualified that statement with enough \"ifs\" but anyway, no different than you assuming any problems between brands would be minor to the owner. I\\'m not a huge fan of CR data either, but they have been on the money regarding where the problems were on most of my prior vehicles.Minor/major, I guess that is personal and relative. My last Ford had a transmission issue. At 9k they slapped a band-aid on it (still a pretty involved procedure) and said \"all fixed.\" It wasn\\'t any better. After that, they \"couldn\\'t duplicate the problem.\" When the warranty ran out at 36K I had the full transmission service done. Little help. So I checked the good \\'ol Edmunds \"maintenance and repair\" forums and people were replacing trannies out of warranty. I\\'d probably have kept it if not for being worried about that and other issues. If I could have avoided that one problem by buying a different vehicle in the first place, it would have been worth it *to me.* We\\'re not talking stranding, however several trips to dealer and eventual loss of faith in the vehicle out of warranty.  The 03 Accord was not light years ahead of the midsize competition, lets not forget the then new Altima was available, as was a new Camry. So at best the Accord was competitive, but not light years as you mention.Don\\'t forget the brand-new Mazda6 was out for \\'03 as well.If, and I mean IF, the Accord was \"lightyears\" ahead of the competition, it probably would\\'ve beaten the Infiniti G35 for Motor Trend COTY.The Accord redesign kept it one of the top competitors in the class, but I\\'d hardly call it \"lightyears\" ahead.  Other car makers are severely criticized for selling into fleets and rentals. It lowers resale value for one quote from posters.Here the Prius had just had slowing sales. Magically it\\'s a plus from the auto analyst that selling into fleets and rentals is going to be GOOD for the image. Duhhhhhhh. Not true. It just shows the actual lack of sales for the Prius.  The Accord redesign kept it one of the top competitors in the class, but I\\'d hardly call it \"lightyears\" ahead.I agree. While the Accord is competitive and does best most cars in this class in several ways the differences are pretty minor. Certainly not \"lightyears\". That\\'s a pretty bold statement to make without backing it up in any way. I mean, was that statement purely media induced or do we have some hard facts to back it up?  AAAARGH...my dealer told me that I had to hold on to the loan for at least 3 months or else the rebate would be taken back! Oh well, my net was around $740 which still isn\\'t so bad. I hate slimy dealers!Actually, your net might have been a bit higher than you think, since it sounded like you would have financed the car anyway. So your net rebate would be based on the difference in the interest cost between the MAC loan and the loan you replaced it with. All three places I shopped at told me it could be paid off right away. OTOH, I did get hosed on the rate...10.5% for me, with a credit score around 800. Not that it mattered much, given the length of time I had the loan  .The dealer I bought from mentioned some places telling this 3 month story. The finance guy said no way would he do that because it is not worth getting in trouble with the state regulators.I have never seen another case where they gave a rebate only if you took a loan. It looks like they no longer are doing this with the Mazda6...now it\\'s $1500 instead of $2000, but no requirement to take a loan to get any of it.  Magically it\\'s a plus from the auto analyst that selling into fleets and rentals is going to be GOOD for the image.Actually Ford has been praised for selling Hybrid Escapes to fleets because it supposedly helps the image. The New York Taxi fleets using them comes to mind off the bat.  But commercial fleets are totally different than rental fleets. Commercial fleet sales are longer term and don\\'t result in a flood of used cars. They are also better maintained.  We have enough midsize sedans to argue about discuss, we don\\'t need to be dragging off-topic vehicles in here just to bicker over what fleet sales mean.   I think the Fusion styling is unique, but bland. The taillights are ugly, the rest of the car is nondescript. Realizing however, that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder...  I\\'ve heard this story also. And after two Fords...seems to be true.  re 2137Maybe some people have reached the point where they expect even more than excellent from everything. They won\\'t tolerate even the slightest quirks,etc,regardless of what/where/why. A few years ago we couldn\\'t even find a vehicle whose quality would match these of today. Almost every car in this category is miles ahead in the quality race, compared to say 10 yrs ago. Who knows why people respond the way they do to the various questionnaires ? I just don\\'t think you can judge completely by any survey, you have to find out for yourself.van  now you think everybody should buy a Fusion because YOU think it looks better! As graduate says that kind of thing 100% subjective and probably should be the last reason to buy anything. IMO the new Altima followed by the Aura are the better looking cars in this class right now, but it really really doesn\\'t matter at all.  These are everyday consumers<<b>i>you don\\'t know this and neither do I know that they weren\\'t as kristie noted. Does it bother you BTW that both C&D and later, R&T were also being PAID by Ford as well, that Ford HAD to have them there to lend any sort of credibility to the result that they wanted, and that both publications came up with different results doing comparisons on their own? ENOUGH of this, believe what you want!  Yes indeed \"ENOUGH\" - no more C&D Fusion comparo/ad/whatever, please.  i\\'m sorry, but everyone has their preferences as to which car is best FOR THEM. but some people on both sides of the aisle seem to want to think that their car is the best and everyone should be driving one!honda, ford, nissan, toyota, GM...they all offer something different to consumers, and they are all fallible. you drive what you like, and others drive what they like.I like nissan - sporty, aggressive styling, fun to drive...not saying it is the best EVER - but the best FOR ME.like the subject line says...-thene   Yeah my only issue is the lack of standard ABS. Honda has it standard, I believe Toyota does too, and while not standard, its hard to find a Fusion w/o it, and its not a lot of $$.I would rather have ABS to avoid an accident than 27 airbags to explode once I am in one.  believe it or not, when i was selling nissans, i\\'d have a decent amount of people ask for a car without ABS. either they didn\\'t like it, or preferred not to have it, etc. i\\'m just saying...if i wanted ABS, then i\\'d find a car with ABS...its not that hard.but if i wanted a car without ABS, its harder to find those over the broad spectrum of cars...either way, the driving dynamics and styling of the nissans are more appealing to me than the other midsized sedans in this class. not that they are bad cars - im sure they are all fantastic! just not for me...-thene   that would be a deal!   I would rather have ABS to avoid an accident than 27 airbags to explode once I am in one.You\\'re kidding, right? How is ABS going to prevent someone from hitting YOU? Especially from a side impact.ABS might allow you to avoid a small percentage of potential accidents whereas airbags will protect you in 100% of potential accidents.  Airbags protect you 100% of the time???? really? I\\'ll remember that when you get T-boned by a 60,000 pound 70\\' long Semi-Truck while I use ABS to steer and slow down enough at the same time to avoid him!Let\\'s see the airbags protect you there!  ABS might allow you to avoid a small percentage of potential accidents whereas airbags will protect you in 100% of potential accidents.Airbags protect you in 0% of potential crashes, they only help you in actual crashes. Further, ABS helps to prevent the need for airbags in everything except side impact, which relatively speaking is a small % of total accidents.One of the reasons the % of side impact accidents is increasing is because the number of rear end collisions is going down because of safety features like ABS.  Let me rephrase that.ABS will allow you to avoid a small percentage of accidents that would otherwise be unavoidable without ABS.Airbags will provide some level of protection in almost all accidents.The statement was that ABS was better than airbags if you had to have one or the other.I say you need both.  Honda would never allow engine problems like Nissan did. They are in different leagues reliability and quality control wise. Only Toyota and Honda share the top rung league of reliability (which of course includes Acura and Lexus.Maintenance means little to nothing to a well built reliable and dependable car. My friend raped the hell out of his \\'94 Prism (Toyota Corrola with GEO emblem on the grill). He floored the little thing wherever he went. It was his first car, he was a teenage driver; you get the picture? He banged it up good, drove it like a madman, and maintained it lazily; he got it to 100,000 miles without spending a dime in repairs (other than maybe some bodywork for \"accidents\").I babied and pampered my \\'95 Neon, oil changes every 3K miles, all the maintenance under the severe schedule recommendations. I had to spend around 5,000 dollars keeping it running; and that includes getting rid of it at 65,000 miles. I can only imagine it might have taken the next owner at least another $10,000 dollars to get that car to 100K miles.If a car can\\'t be driven agressively, (abused as you say) and still hold up, then it is a piece of junk. Plain and simple. Any high quality vehicle (like my 2003 Honda) can be driven as hard as you want w/o worry of any \"problems,\" granted, you should at least follow a reasonable maintenance schedule if your going to be driving it hard.Reliability and dependability ratings should not only be based on \"best case scenario\" maintenance and BABYING it type driving, but also \"minimum maintenance\" and VERY AGGRESIVE type driving. That is what matters, that is what counts, and that is the true test. Either way, there is no reason to believe that not maintaining vehicles (because low income people might not do it) would affect reliablity rankings in a way that would make them unreliable data. All car brands and all car models would be equally mis-maintained over a large sample size. Also, Mercedes/Chrysler have reached the bottom of the pit in reliability, and last I checked low income people don\\'t buy them. Honda\\'s and Toyota\\'s are fairly economical, and they are at the top......Hmm.......  I think the Fusion styling is unique, but bland. Wow, really. I don\\'t care for the styling myself, but bland??? The excessive chrome grill is certainly not bland. I\\'m pretty sure if you look up the definition of that word, there is a picture of the current Accord there :P  .The best looking of these cars is clearly the Mazda6  . This is proven by Toyota\\'s feeble attempt to copy some of its appearance features into the new Camry.The Altima is not appealing to me at all. The only thing the new design accomplishes is to make the previous version look not so bad. Maybe if they did something to make the rear end not look so \"heavy\"...  As for the Fusion making the Accord and Camry look \"frumpy\", park the Fusion next to an Aura, or Altima, or even the old Mazda6, and suddenly the Fusion looks pretty frumpy, in my eyes.I saw an Aura on the road today and I was reminded that it is a very slick looking car, especially the rear 3/4 view. Maybe because there is actually some sheet metal on the car, vs. all tailights and headlamps as on the Altima.  The Mazda6 is an old design now but I think it\\'s worn well, especially the Special Value Edition available now with minimal ground effects, big alloys, and blacked-out lamps.  I say you need both.Oh if I get both by all means bring on the balloons to keep my head out of the grill of an SUV driven by someone the phone as they mow through a red light.  The truth is, according to the data from JD Powers AND Consumer Reports, that the difference between cars in this category over a five year period is minimal, and the chances are that the problem that does occur is going to be minor which does not require immediate and emergency attention. So any talk about how much more reliable a certain car is without any verifiable statistics is baseless or at least anecdotal. Because the data that really does exist shows that the differences in reliability between cars in this class is quite small, and would probably surprise most buyers. I do understand your reluctance to trust a certain brand because of personal expererience... but working in electronics retail showed me that EVERY manufacturerer has problems so if every one of those customers with a bad experience means that brand was bad, well there would be no brands to buy. I will pay attention to blogs and forums to get a gauge of what areas are problematic, but I will always give more weight to studies that gather information from thousands of sources and not just one.  Furthermore, Ford, GM, and all other mfrs replace faulty parts under warranty. Why point out that Honda did too? It\\'s not like they did anything any other mfr would have done. Incorrect!!!! You couldn\\'t be more wrong. Dodge never offered to ante up for fixing my early death faulty tranny in my Dodge. Chrysler didn\\'t come to the rescue either. In fact, when I asked the Dodge dealer why I had to keep coming back and why the car kept breaking down, the reply was, \"cars just breakdown, parts just break down.\" So I was left out in the cold by Chrysler/Dodge. I will never buy an American vehicle again because of THAT tranny failure. The same thing happened to me again in my V6 Accord from 2003, but Honda stepped up and fixed it AFTER warranty technically expired. Not only did they pay to fix it, but they paid for the rental, ordered the new tranny assembly overnight shipping, and got me back on the road on Wednesday after taking the car in on Monday morning. I paid nothing. For the Dodge, I paid about $1,200 to fix it. I will buy a Honda again if I feel like it. I will never ever until hell freezes over and pigs fly on the same day buy a Chrysler made product.Honda stands behind their products, I have serious doubts about the Big 3. Heck, they might not even exist in 4 years when your tranny fails in that Ford, GM, or Chrysler product, what then, no one to go to for Warranty repairs! Think about that! They will go out of business and screw all of their customers in a heartbeat.Also, it didn\\'t hurt that the Tranny issue was the ONLY mechanical issue in my Honda, meanwhile the Dodge had 100 problems mechanically, literally.  The 2003 Accord Coupe offerred me 240 HP with 30 MPG on the highway (EPA rating). It offered traction control, ABS, power driver\\'s seat, built-in alarm/security system, 6 CD changer, and I got it all for 25K out the door.What other vehicle could I have purchased THAT MEETS or exceeds, get that... MEETS or EXCEEDS (not comes close in some area or other) in November of 2002? 21/30 mpg, 240 HP, very good handling and interior fit and finish, excellent build quality.  all of that is nice - but its not \"lightyears\" ahead of the other sedans available at that time...if that\\'s what you consider \"lightyears\" though...i don\\'t know what to tell ya...-thene   Oh Really?-You are aware that Honda\\'s last gen. 3.5 engine, used in my neighbors Odyssey (and the reworked one is in my Pilot) was removed from the van as oil was not reaching a part of the engine. It was an engineering issue and req\\'d redesign. This was not publicized because Honda found the issue before it was reported. It req\\'d removing 22,000 Odyssey engines and shipping them for the work. -You are aware the last generation Acura MDX had transmission failure issues and so many brake failures that they faced recalls to change the master cylinder. The Civic has also had serious brake issues after 50,000 miles -You are aware that this generations Accord has had hundreds of thousands of center stack cluster failures (stereo units only).Consumers are seriously misled if they believe that a car manufacturer is bulletproof and their models are free from defect in engineering or design. Even the best manufacturers deal with recalls as they have to deal with part makers they outsource to. They also sometimes make mistakes in the engineering process. This is a fact: the level of quality between the best and worst manufacturer today is so small, in defects per 100 vehicles, that the over publication of \\'quality\\' being owned by a few manufacturers is ridiculous. Do most people realize that we are talking about 1 problem (and that problem could be a seatbelt handle as in the Hyundai Sonata) per 100 vehicles between the best and worst. Yet JDPower is making millions publicizing this very subjective data. Fact is that Kia\\'s are just about the same as Lexus\\'s. If you dispute this simply study the data.  Maybe the issue then isn\\'t so much the product, but how the manufacturer stands behind the product.In all the examples I\\'ve seen, Toyota and Honda stepped up warranties and did what was in their power to minimize the inconvenience to the customer. It was almost like they were ashamed or embarrassed about it.I am sure others can come up with examples of other manufacturers not taking this route.  Maybe the issue then isn\\'t so much the product, but how the manufacturer stands behind the product.A very keen observation.  \"Fact is that Kia\\'s are just about the same as Lexus\\'s. If you dispute this simply study the data.\"What comes to mind here are lies, damn lies and statistics. If you believe the data shows Kia is on par with Lexus with regard Lexus\\' overall track record, I don\\'t know what to say.There is not a manufacturer on the face of this planet who can claim they have had a perfect track record. Buying a car is a crap shoot. You can end up with a lemon from the worlds best manufacturer. Conversly you can end up with a stellar experience from the world worst manufacturer.Having said that, I would rather take my chances with some, than with others.  One manufacturer could have 10 problems all in one car, thereby losing a customer for life, while another could have 1 problem in 10 vehicles, thereby simply annoying but not losing 10 customers.  Remember we\\'re talking about the midsize sedans, please. We\\'re going off-topic a lot in the past few pages and that always gets us into trouble.  that this generations Accord has had hundreds of thousands of center stack cluster failures (stereo units only). know of one that did exactly this BUT Honda replaced it even though the car was well out of any warranties. However, the whole concept that any manufactuer of anything is somehow exempt from problems is ridiculous, how they handle it once it does happen is something else. If I remember correctly, the previously mentioned Nissan engine problem, had Nissan suspending 4 cylinder model sales (at the dealer level) as well as discontinuing production until that problem was solved. That, in my mind, is being proactive, and a good example of a responsive mfgr..  The differences in SE-V6 and EX-V6 are as night and day as LX 4-cyl and EX-L 4-cyl, and their $4,000 difference in MSRP reflects that. It isn\\'t just minor stuff. it\\'s leather, heated seats, auto climate control, black plastic trim vs. wood/alumininum trim, etc...Can\\'t compare an SE-V6 to an LX 4-cyl though... SE 4-cyl is the correct comparison. LX 4-cyl has steelies. About the only thing in the EX-V6 to me that actually is nice to have would be the XM sat radio.  However, the whole concept that any manufactuer of anything is somehow exempt from problems is ridiculous, how they handle it once it does happen is something else.Truer words were never written, Captain2.  either way, the driving dynamics and styling of the nissans are more appealing to me than the other midsized sedans in this class. not that they are bad cars - im sure they are all fantastic! just not for me...-theneI feel the same exact way about our Fusion. I would substitute Fusions for Nissans in your sentence. Boz  Fair enough (we\\'re really nit-picking). I was thinking about the interior trim. All black plastic in the SE V6 and LX 4-cyl. The SE 4-cyl gives you upgraded trim.  What comes to mind here are lies, damn lies and statistics.\\'We have a conspiracy theorist here and I am talking about initial quality, which is the first 90 days of ownership. Kia has about 125 problems per 100 vehicle. This is from surveys. Lexus has a little under 100. So we are talking about a very small percentage of problems the owners of Lexus\\' and Kia\\'s are experiencing in the first 90 days of ownership. One of our clients bought a Lexus IS250awd and had two problems in the first 90 days. Lexus came and picked up the car and dropped it back off. They also gave her a choice of a gift on both occasions. She was begged not to report the problems on the survey. She didn\\'t. She was very happy still. You believe what you want.  Honda would never allow engine problems like Nissan did.nissan didn\\'t \"allow\" the problem. It showed up, and was quickly corrected. It can and does happen to every automobile manufacture.They are in different leagues reliability and quality control wiseno they aren\\'t. I have a 9 yr old nissan in my driveway with 145k miles on it that has not had 1 repair made to it. doesn\\'t get any better than 0Maintenance means little to nothing to a well built reliable and dependable carit has everything to do with it. My job involves visiting hundreds of repair shops, and meeting upwards of a thousand mechanics a year. I can quite confidently tell you that the majority of cars being fixed in garages are being fixed because they weren\\'t properly maintained. and yes, I see plenty of hondas, and toyotas; along with every other make of car. The overwhelming number of engines replacements are done because the engine sludged up from lack of proper oil changes. the overwhelming number of radiator/head gasket repairs are made because the cooling system was never flushed. the vast majority of transmissions needing replaced/rebuilt are because they were never flushed. It is absolutely astonishing how people treat their cars. I couldn\\'t count the number of times I\\'ve seen a radiator flushed and the water comes out brown with tiny peices of corrosion in it, or the number of times I\\'ve seen engines so sludged up that oil couldn\\'t even be poured in because it couldn\\'t drain down. If you in any way doubt this, stop changing your oil and come back in 15,000 miles and let me know how your car is doing.oh, and I never said much about how you drive it. cars shouldn\\'t be any less reliable if they\\'re driven hard.   have serious doubts about the Big 3. Heck, they might not even exist in 4 years when your tranny fails in that Ford, GM, or Chrysler productthey arn\\'t going anywhere. keep in mind, ford still sells about 100k more vehicles a month than honda. at least in the US.   Consumers are seriously misled if they believe that a car manufacturer is bulletproof and their models are free from defect in engineering or design. Even the best manufacturers deal with recalls as they have to deal with part makers they outsource to. They also sometimes make mistakes in the engineering process.Don\\'t know about Pilots etc, all I can tell about is my Accord. My V6 Accord (03) did have a recall on the transmission. The recall fix obviously worked, because I haven\\'t been seeing much about failing transmissions in 03 V6 Accords. I am at 47k miles and my tranny is working great. I have also heard about the radio displays going out on 03 Accords. I recently received a notice from Honda that the warranty has been extended to 7 years/100k miles for the radio displays. They will also reimburse anyone who has paid for the display before the warranty extension. My display has not gone out, but it is nice to know Honda is standing behind the car if it does.  How many car companies would do this?  How many car companies would do this? not enough  My display has not gone out, but it is nice to know Honda is standing behind the car if it does. How many car companies would do this?In a perfect world, they all would. It\\'s too bad we live in an imperfect world, one where far too many manufacturers respond with \"Tough luck buddy. Better luck next time.\"  The overwhelming number of engines replacements are done because the engine sludged up from lack of proper oil changes.This reminds me of one neighbor\\'s car. He never changed the oil, only added some when it got low. It lasted a few years, but it finally burned up. When he took the valve cover off, I could see the word Ford from the valve cover imprinted on the sludge packed in there. Like the mechanic says, \"pay me a little now, or a lot later\".  \"cars shouldn\\'t be any less reliable if they\\'re driven hard.\"Really? That\\'s pretty comforting. I drive my cars pretty hard, but not what one might consider abuse. I never drop the clutch, always start cleanly then throttle it. I don\\'t powershift. I usually shift up at 3k RPMs, sometimes 4, less often 5, and rarely redline, but I\\'m mostly into the throttle pretty good regardless of RPM. I often wonder if driving less enthusiastically would have a dramatic increase in the longevity of the vehicle. But that wouldn\\'t be any fun! Besides, I can\\'t be too bad as I still see EPA mileage, and at over 5,200 miles the Accord\\'s \"maintenance minder\" is still showing 30% oil life left (apparently calculated based on accumulated engine revs). I always do the maintenance, full synthetic etc.What\\'s everyone think? Do you typically drive your midsize sedan more like a sports sedan? If so, do you think it will affect long-term reliabilty?  as long as your driving hard, and not abusing. Its like with a clutch, droping it isn\\'t nearly as bad as driving with it half in, half out. That what kills them the fastest. Not saying its good to rev the engine to 5ooo rpm and then pop it, but I\\'d consider that abusive too. I think you might see a little more longevity (my speculation) if you were easier on it, but only because hard driving will tend to make a weak part give out. As where with easier driving, it might last a little longer.Oil is kind of funny, and very condition dependant. newer cars run much cleaner than cars of 10yrs ago. Couple that with much improved oil (the addatives) and it tends to stay cleaner a lot longer. someone driving primarily highway miles for moderate distances could very well go 5,6 or more thousand miles without an oil change. On the flip side, someone driving short distance, stop and go rush hour traffic would be making a huge mistake to change their oil any less than 3k.  Plus, honestly, what\\'s the cost of an oil change? $20? $30? It\\'s not like one extra change or two per year is going to blow your bank account or anything.And it gives you better mileage and less wear as well, since there\\'s less sludge and gunk circulating. Of course, I also put some oil stabilizer in as well, since the summers out here in CA/NV/etc are brutal and sap viscosity like a vacuum cleaner. Doubly so if it\\'s an older car. And, yeah - even with a new car, 3K and the oil is dirty and full of gunk. Goes in almost clear and comes out the color of mud. Using that oil life sensor and going 5-6K between changes is what gets you the sludge. Trust your brain and not the gadget I say.  And, yeah - even with a new car, 3K and the oil is dirty and full of gunk. Goes in almost clear and comes out the color of mud. Using that oil life sensor and going 5-6K between changes is what gets you the sludge. depends a lot on the driving too. For instance, I drive one of my cars 25 miles to work on 4 lane road with no lights or stop signs. the engine has plenty of time to reach proper operating temp, and I don\\'t have any of the slow speed stop and go traffic. At 3k, the oil looks like it just came out of the bottle.Now my wife on the other hand, drives 7 or 8 miles to and from work through about a dozen traffic lights in stop and go driving. the oil in that car starts to get black at about 2500 miles.But like you said, its $30 plus they vaccum and wash your windows. when in doubt, just change it.  Dodge never offered to ante up for fixing my early death faulty tranny in my Dodge.If it was out of warranty then they had no reason to. Honda\\'s tranny failures were of a different nature and happened early on in the vehicles life in a lot of cases which prompted them to extend the warranty. That\\'s why your Honda transmission was replaced. Do you really think that if the tranny goes out on a Honda vehicle which is out of warranty, standard or extended, they\\'ll replace the tranny for free? If yes, then head on over here because I have a lot of nice bridges for sale.  Not talking about IQS. Talking about overall customer experience. Lexus is about as bullet proof as they come over the life of car. In my opinion, that is far from the case with Kia vehicles. Most vehicles these days have a high IQS with the first 90 days of ownership. There are exceptions to the rule of course, but the fringe cases are not the rule.Everybody will believe what they want and can have some statistic to support their assertion.  Do you really think that if the tranny goes out on a Honda vehicle which is out of warranty, standard or extended, they\\'ll replace the tranny for free? Yes, it has happened many times. If you have proof that maintenance was done, and it is an obvious defect, Honda will work with you. Honda customers know what \"good will\" repair means. That\\'s how they keep customers coming back.  Actually, I tend to believe you. never had to take the civic in for anything, but after they way they handled the odometer thing, deffinitly impressed me.for those who don\\'t know, honda cars were accused of misreading milage. and, even though the varations in actual mileage vs. odometer milage were less than the margin of error set by the government, honda willingly, without being forced, extened all waranties and made restitutions to people who leased and had to pay milage charges.  honda willingly, without being forced, extened all waranties and made restitutions to people who leased and had to pay milage charges.They were sued. I think they had a pretty good reason to give the money back don\\'t you?Why must everyone spin Honda\\'s actions into being \"for the greater good\"? They are a company in business to make money, not save the world. :sick:  yes, they were sued, but there was no indication they would loose. the amounts their odometers were off were well within what the government allowed. Personally, I don\\'t see how they could have lost. basically, the gvt says you can be off +/- 1 mile per 100 and the honda odo\\'s were off +/- .5 miles per 100. those arn\\'t exact numbers, but thats how it shook out. But honda decided they would voluntarily make restitution.FYI, Nissan was sued for the same thing, and has chosen to fight it in court.and read some of my posts. though I have nothing against honda, I am by no means a honda homer. I prefer nissan myself, but don\\'t mind giving honda props where its due.  Why must everyone spin Honda\\'s actions into being \"for the greater good\"? They are a company in business to make money, not save the world. You don\\'t seem to understand. :confuse: Honda sees \"Good Will\" repairs as an investment, in Repeat Customers. When you loose customers, you loose sales down the road. You can tell which companies didn\\'t see it as an investment 10 years ago. The same ones who are loosing money now.  Honda may have also made a business decision that it was less expensive to fix, whether needed or not, than to get tied up in lengthy litigation. Out of court settlements are made all the time, particularly dubious claims for injuries resulting from car accidents. If an insurance company can \"buy out\" of a claim for $2,000 rather than spend a minimum of $1500 fighting a case they could lose, they\\'ll \\'buy out\" most every time.  Ford only knows how to sell trucks and Toyota\\'s ruining their party slowly - they can\\'t sell midsized sedans or even cars to equal Toyota/Honda or even come anywhere close. :P I\\'m not in the market for a truck, and if I was, I\\'d get a Tundra. Still amazed at how silent and smooth my Honda Accord V6 runs - effortless power. :shades:  Ford only knows how to sell trucks and Toyota\\'s ruining their party slowly yes, but trucks out sell cars, have since the 90\\'s. and toyota could one day seriously cut into them, but they have a loooooong way to go. The new tundra is nice, but it doesn\\'t even come close to what a F-350 can do. there is a huge gap between what a ford truck and a toyota truck can do.ford could very easily survive as a truck company. hell, they practicly are now.and both toyota and nissan scrubbed their plans for Heavy duty/super duty versions of the tundra and titan.  Do you actually think Ford can survive on only heavy duty trucks. Not a chance.  Reving a warmed engine with good oil pressure isn\\'t going to hurt anything, thats why the oil is there. Once it gets to proper temp, your pistons are gliding on sheet of warm oil. It is basically a zero wear environment. If an engine is never rev\\'d, the piston may go microscopically higher in the cylinder than it is used to, and the carbon deposits can build up in the cylinder walls and stop the piston or chip the piston ring. Either way, its not pretty but I haven\\'t heard of a case of this on a modern engine with modern gas.Dropping the clutch isn\\'t as hard on the clutch as riding it, but its harder on the rest of the drive-train and suspension components. Shock loading every gear and shaft in the system isn\\'t particularly helpful. Just watch amateur drag night (racing, not cross-dressing) and watch for the broken drive shafts and transmissions and suspension components.You can use machinery, just try to have some respect for it and be mindful of what you are asking it to do.  Have you checked out the prices of oil lately *cough* like today? :sick:One day all Ford will be is just selling 250/350s and Econovans to businesses, not consumers. :lemon: Mullaly should have stayed at Boeing - their stock is through the roof and they are kicking Airbus like crazy. Ford\\'s got no Dreamliner either... and even Jag\\'s on the chopping block.  \"Ford Fusion didn\\'t meet my needs, but that doesn\\'t mean it was an inferior vehicle.

Haven\\'t driven the 3.5 but I\\'m would tend to believe it\\'s more of the same with a bigger engine.The Legacy is the most useful car overall in this class. It has AWD, long cargo area, optional turbo. The only problem with it, is the cabin is a bit cramped for my tastes.Mazda to me is to small as a family sedan. In my area a lot of kids drive them, probably because they can be had for a song.  Really? I\\'m underwhelmed to each his own  I just think the whole package is sort of blah, including the drive. I\\'m not really a Nissan fan. I did however own multiple Nissans\\' in the past. (However my owners experience left me cold).  Very nice pic of the Mazda6. Every time i see a Mazda6 i cant help but admire the incredible tight body panel fit on the vehicle. Im aware most modern sedans boast excellent fit and finish, but the 6 has been out for some time under the current design, which is aging quite well, still looks very sharp and athletic. Cant wait to see what Mazda has planned for the 08 model, im sure it will be a very sharp vehicle, as most of Mazda\\'s current lineup is looking impressive.  As bad as the Honda and Toyota cheerleaders are and as much as I like Ford, your posts are just as bad.Great stuff.  where all the Nissan Altima owners are?? I am very surprised there aren\\'t more in this room full of Honda/Toyota/Ford owners.I did notice that the Altima now has one consumer review and received all 10s and 9s.

I\\'ve maintained that it was/is a competitor.I went out on the local cycling club bike ride this morning, and noticed 4 or 5 new Fusions way out there in the country (aka Ford Land). In one driveway, next to the big Ford truck, was one of the new Fusions. At the end of the driveway was an 03-05 Accord, with \"For Sale\" signs on it. Fusion is winning some buyers away!  Nice Mazda6. The hatchbacks are cool. Keep the pics coming, they keep the forum interesting.Who was it that put the trailer hitch on? Jd? I\\'ve been thinking about doing that myself.  for some reason the altima reviews were deleted. there were close to 200, then for whatever reasons they deleted them. then it got back up to about 8 or so, and were deleted againhave no idea why. Perhaps one of the mods can answer this?  I just noticed the Sonata reviews are now at zero.  No reviews have been deleted. What\\'s listed at the top is the number of reviews for the current model. When a new model is released, the previous year\\'s reviews are no longer current but they are available just by clicking on the links.  where all the Nissan Altima owners are?? when I\\'m not trying to tone down all the Fusion blog, that would be what I am ,a very satisfied purchaser of 3 Altimas and a Maxima, 2 older 4 bangers and an 03 3.5 (the Maxima had a 3.0). It is from Nissan that my personal bias towards great engines/drivetrains comes. Really like the new Altima but admit to finding the new CVT a little disconcerting. It is strange though that with as many as they sell, that we don\\'t see some \\'blog\\' on this car as well. It is certainly something that is \\'blogable\\'. Don\\'t know what the sales stats are in my area (Texas), but down here I seem to see more of them than Camcords! And yes, CR does have the new Altima tied for top spot in the fiercely competitive midsize sedan segment with the older Accord, but that may change with the new Accord due out in a few months. We\\'ll see...  Oh, I see what you did. but why have the 2007 reviews been moved off the front page when the 2008\\'s haven\\'t hit the market yet? and why is that only done for the altima?  Well, the CVT deffinitly takes some getting used to. Having driven nothing but MT\\'s for the last 18 years, and there\\'s that pesky break in period (almost have to fight the damn car to keep the speed and rpm down, It almost wants to push itself) it was a month or two before I really got used to it. But once I did, I began to realize just how amazing that thing is.As for the blogs, don\\'t know about them, but the enthusiast sites are pretty active.  strange thing is, is that I\\'m not seeing a lot of the new altima around. in the last couple months I\\'ve only noticed two of them. I wonder if the cvt is slowing interest... if people find it feels too strange, it\\'d be hard to plop down 20k on one.   In the list above it\\'s been done for the Sonata as well, and the 08 Altima has indeed hit the market.   Is that an i or de-badged s?  Thanks! Yeah, every time I walk out to find my car in a parking lot, I think that it still looks really nice vs it\\'s peers, even if it\\'s a car designed 5 years ago. It just has a nice flow to it. I agree with backy who said that the newer mazda6\\'s have a bit more of a refined look since they toned down some of the sharper ground effects, but it still has the typical muscular mazda curves. The 08 has me pretty excited too, especially hearing what they may do to bump up the power. I just hope they don\\'t make it too big and make it feel too bloated and boat-ish. Right now, passenger space is perfectly adequate if just a bit snug, but the handling and balance is great for a passenger car. I spent 20 minutes riding in the back seat of a friend\\'s mazda6, and I was perfectly comfortable with plenty of legroom and headroom. But I get the sense that with all the other cars in this class getting bigger, the dye has been cast for the 6 to maybe be a bit less sleek like it is now, and be a bit more muscular in the next gen.  yeah, it\\'s a debadged \"s\" - I took off the mazda logos and the v-6 badges. I also took off the bumper guards on the doors to try to give the profile a bit more of a clean, sleek look. Nothing major as far as mods go, but just some little details to make my car a bit more unique than Mazda6\\'s already are.  I read somewhere that Texas is one of the few states in the U.S. where Nissan outsells Honda and Toyota...must still be true. I\\'m going to look for that article.I notice in Atlanta that Nissan are pretty abundant as well, but so are Hondas and Toyotas.In South Carolina. Toyota in particular rules.  In North Carolina, i see more Camrys than anything else, and the rest of the midsizers as follows in order from most popular to least:Accord, Sonata, Altima, Fusion/Milan, Mazda6, G6, Optima, Aura.  Accord, Sonata, Altima, Fusion/Milan, Mazda6, G6, Optima, Aura.I\\'m in NC too, but Sonata third behind Camry & Accord? I\\'d put the Altima and the Fulan ahead of the Sonata. Then the rest. I see minimal Mazda 6s and Optimas.  Just based on sightings, I\\'d have to say the Camrys and Accords dominate the mid-size sedan market in Salisbury, MD, followed by Altimas and Sonatas.Fusions and Milans are not commonplace at all. Which, as the owner of a 2007 SEL AWD Fusion, is kind of nice. The Fusion\\'s bold, distinctive looks still stands out in a crowded field. It is nice to have a great car that is different from the \"herd.\"  You don\\'t seem to understand. Honda sees \"Good Will\" repairs as an investment, in Repeat Customers.Going by that they should have replaced our driver\\'s power window track 3 months after the warranty expired ($400+ out of our pocket), the shocks at 30k miles, the muffler at 35k miles, the clunking spring in the right rear (they never did \"reproduce\" that one to fix it) and several other electrical and poorly crafted items in our \\'96 Civic. But alas, they didn\\'t. Maybe Civic owners aren\\'t important enough for their \"good will\"? The brake pads kept wearing out about every 12k miles no matter what kind we put on too. I understand that that\\'s not necessarily their fault though. h, and the catalytic converter\\'s heat shields both rusted off not long after the warranty wore off (the years came long before the miles) and their advise to us was \"not to park in grass or dry leaves\". I should have done just that and let the thing burn to the ground.I\\'d still buy another Honda, but I\\'ll never put them up on a pedestal like the media and other folks do.  Of about 500 people...I was the second person to get an Altima...now there are at least 10...which is amazing considering how well the Camcords sell in my area.I think in major cities you\\'ll see quite a bit of Sonatas and even Altimas and Camrys because they sell so many to fleets. Here the new Camry dominates...period.  In central SD Camrys and Accords are fairly rare. They are outnumerd nearly 10 to 1 by Suburbans. :surprise: Sad state of affairs really.   Accords used to be really dominant here in NJ until the new Camry came along. Now there\\'s Camrys galore. There used to be a ton of Altimas too but I haven\\'t seen as many of the redesigned ones.The Fusion\\'s bold, distinctive looks still stands out in a crowded field.The old Camry was bland and boring. The new Camry is a lot more bold and distinctive, and IMO, front ugly. The Fusion is back ugly to me - rice-a-roni lights and plain exhaust tips on the ones I seem to see (only the SEL has chrome tips). And the redesigned Altima has taken bold and distinctive to a whole new level.  I feel the same about my ex-Ford, which shortly after the warranty expired started to have tranny issues and sunroof problems. Ford wanted charge me over $1000 to diagnose these problems, not including the repair. After two vehicles they don\\'t get a third chance no matter how many JD Powers awards they get.  I\\'m sure the \"good will\" depends on whether or not you bring the car to that dealer for maintenance, and the dealer service manager\\'s willingness to work with you. The dealer will not just offer you good will service, you have to ask for consideration. If it\\'s a common problem, you have a shot. I have not received a good will repair on my 2 Accords, but then I don\\'t bring the car to the dealer for maintenance, and there was only one repair done at the dealer since I bought the first Accord in 91.  they are in business to make money, and aren\\'t going to give anybody free car care for life. But like I was saying with the odometer problems; they settled and agreed to pay up. Nissan is still fighting in court with no intention of paying a dime. Not that I blame them, neither company was in the wrong.  are you residing per chance in Pierre, SD? Uh-huh, the capital city. We lived there for a while in 2005. Lots of Suburbans and Ford and GM pick-em-up trucks. Oh, and don\\'t forget all the old GM cars and Ford Escorts, etc. It really is a dead place for automobiles!  I have to agree...some elements of the Fusion don\\'t sit well with me. I\\'m beginning to like the Milan better. The Fusion looks so 1990s to me...it\\'s too boxy looking and the taillights are Altima-like but not nearly as cool looking. Folks like to knock the Camcords but the Fusion offers nothing compelling outside of it\\'s three bar grille, Caddy/Nissan styled headlights and clear taillamps in the back. I don\\'t think there is an \"original\" design in this class of car because even the Altima got it\\'s roofline from the Passat, but the Altima love it or leave it...is one of the few somewhat distinctive sedans in its class. The Mazda6 is probably the only other distinctive looking one. I do feel that the new Altima played it too safe though. Even the alloy wheels on the 07s resemble the previous Altima\\'s alloys too much and from the sides the 17s on the SE models look like 15s. And especiallly from the sides, the Altima looks hatchback-like this time around because of the high designed trunk and taillights that stick out at on the sides. Nissan should upgrade and make 17s standard and 18s SE/SL exclusives. The Altima has always been my choice style-wise (and my opinions are subjective) but its always been the Accord that I thought was the best. Nissan brought some neat technology to the table this time around Bluetooth (Toyota did that first) push start standard, optional rear view camera, xenons (the prev. gen had those) etc. etc. I hope the Accord has some of those features and more..and keeps some features that the Altima still lacks (power passenger\\'s seat) and maybe adds some things (power pedals, rain sensing wipers.I actually think the Accord will have a nice front end this time around from what we have seen, I like the sides too. Just hope the rear looks decent. I\\'m just sad that it seems the V6/6spd combo won\\'t be available this time around.  And the redesigned Altima has taken bold and distinctive to a whole new level.Nothing personal, neteng, but the Altima is my least favorite mid-size sedan, especially because of its styling. Different strokes for different folks. But the taillights on our Fusion are something that I would change if I could.  I am a bit surprised Sonatas would not be more popular in the Southeast, since they are built there. Perhaps it is partly due to lack of dealer coverage in the more rural areas of the Southeast?  the redesigned Altima has taken bold and distinctive to a whole new level.the same could be said when the Altima first became truly competitive in this segment - back in 2002. A car largely responsible for Nissan\\'s turnaround , that I think eventually got all the way up to 4th or 5th in sales numbers and the first to use a truly awesome V6 under the hood thereby forcing Honda and Toyota to respond. The new one takes the \\'spirit\\' of the 2002 model to the next level, IMO , so if you didn\\'t like the first one you are not likely to have much use for the new one. Establishing an identity I guess. As you say - different strokes. I do agree also that the Fulan\\'s taillights and rear end is too high, but I definitely would prefer the Milan to the Fusion - if for no other reason than the \\'in your face\\' razor blades. If this is Ford\\'s new \\'identity\\', I will leave them alone even if they do update the powertrains - the 500 was a better looking car, IMO than the regurgitated Taurus. The 6 is much better overall styling wise, IMO, but it also looks and apparently is SMALL. The Camry is certainly something really adventurous and is either love it or hate it (an unusual chance for Toyota to take), even at 4 years old the Accord still looks good to me, the Aura looks good although also plagued with a too high rear end, and the Sonata seems a hodgepodge of borrowed elements from both the Accord, old Camry, and the Lexus\\'.  Nothing personal, neteng, but the Altima is my least favorite mid-size sedan, especially because of its styling. Different strokes for different folks. But the taillights on our Fusion are something that I would change if I could.I agree with you on the Altima. If I had bought a Fusion, I think I\\'d see if I could modify the tailights. I think they look better like this:  I do agree also that the Fulan\\'s taillights and rear end is too high, but I definitely would prefer the Milan to the Fusion - if for no other reason than the \\'in your face\\' razor blades. If this is Ford\\'s new \\'identity\\', I will leave them alone even if they do update the powertrains - the 500 was a better looking car, IMO than the regurgitated Taurus. The 6 is much better overall styling wise, IMO, but it also looks and apparently is SMALL.I agree with all that, except I love the size of my 6.Being an anti-chromite, I\\'m no fan of Ford\\'s new grill. I still like the 6 better, but I think the fusion is improved with a body colored grill:  Um, it may be just me, but I\\'m running the latest version of IE and can\\'t see the pics. Not sure if its just me though. I\\'d kinda like to see them as a matter of fact!   I am a bit surprised Sonatas would not be more popular in the SoutheastIs Alabama the Southeast? They\\'re in the Central time zone. I\\'d consider them more Deep South with Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee....FWIW  Yeah buddy, we\\'re in the Southeast!  It\\'s considered Southeast all the way to Louisiana (SEC). There are a few Sonatas around here, of course there is a new (two year old) dealership in town. They are still outnumbered by Altimas and Impalas though. There seems to be more Accords than Camrys here. 90% are the 4cyl version though.  After I got my Sonata 2 years ago, I started noticing more of them (and various other Hyundai\\'s) than before. A big factor is also the length of time a model has been selling well. Accord & Camry have been established for many years while Sonata is a relatively new kid on the block. There\\'s a lot more 10-12 year old Accords and Camry\\'s around (which adds to the Accord/Camry population) than 10-12 year old Sonata\\'s. The gap of 5 year old (or less) models has narrowed in my area, I think. It\\'s hard to quantify because driving the same route at roughly the same time of day, I see mostly the same cars on a schedule similar to mine. I\\'m also seeing more Azera\\'s on the road, which may just be a function of that model being out for almost 2 years.  Aside from your misuse of the good ole apostrophe, I\\'d have to agree with you. There are a LOT of 10-12 year old CamCords around in my town too!  My \\'05 Sonata replaced a 14 year old LeBaron convertible. There was still a pretty good number of them on the road around here at the time. Now that they\\'ve been out of production since \\'94 (?), there\\'s not many around. However, the successor, Sebring, is not uncommon. While the CamCords have changed in appearance, I think it\\'s still easy to recognize (link) a 10 to 12 year old CamCord compared to the current model (but maybe not the \\'07 Camry).  and can\\'t see the pics. I\\'m in the same boat, grad, and I\\'m using Safari on my Mac. Can\\'t see the pics.  I don\\'t think anyone can see the pictures. I use photobucket (image hosting) and the \"HTML Tag\". works every time (on this forum). Other forums I have to use the \"Img Code\".  Good guess - Pierre it is. Not too many other choices though.BTW I can see the pictures fine with IE6  \"but I think the fusion is improved with a body colored grill: \"I am reading the grill can be had in Black on some SE versions of Fusions... Same color in my opinion would take away the cars lines and character.  I feel the same.. I am seeing more Fusions and Milans lately.. When you see one they really stand out and it catches your eye. :shades: It is nice to feel original and stand out of the crowd a bit with My Fusion.  Northwest its pretty much Honda country. I see lots of Accords then Camry. Its really a toss up between Sonata and Altima for third. Then Fusion/Milan..  I\\'m in the NW also, and I see lots more of the subaru legacy and outback than either the sonata or new Altima combined! I see more Honda Ridgelines than Altimas for goodness sake (but maybe because the Ridge is so ugly it\\'s hard not to see...). Has anyone noticed an uptick in Accord advertising lately? Honda usually does this when it\\'s getting close to releasing the next year\\'s model. Personally, I can\\'t wait to see what they\\'ve done to it, particularly on the coupe. I\\'ve been hearing rumors that it\\'s supposed to be a bit more sporty than the sedan w/ a firmer suspension and tweaked engine. If they go with the great 6-speed manual as they have in the current gen, it sounds like it\\'ll be quite fun. And hopefully they\\'ve done away with the HUGE blindspots that aflicts the current Accord Coupe. Kind of goes to show that the current coupe was a bit of an afterthought rather than a complete design as the next gen will be.  I\\'ve never seen a fusion w/ a similar colored grill... I think it\\'s growing on me. To me, too much chrome is a bit distracting and sometimes I can\\'t see past it... a body colored grill I think brings out the lines a bit more. Personally, I think the Legacy taillights would look pretty good on the back of the fusion.  Not sure why some can not see the fusion pictures. But if that is still a problem, you can click on my ID and then go to my carspace...that is where I put them.  I am reading the grill can be had in Black on some SE versions of FusionsYes, there is an \"appearance package\" that changes it to a black chrome grill. If I were to have bought a Fusion, I had thought I\\'d see if I could buy that grill as a part. I did not like the interior changes that came with the package and IIRC, the package could only be had on black or red...I\\'d have wanted the new \"alloy\" color had I gotten a Fusion or Milan.  honda isn\\'t the only company to do this. nissan does do good will work if you\\'ve gone to the dealer for your maintenance repairs and such. i worked at a nissan dealer for 2 years and saw this happen a few times. the service dept. would go to bat with nissan to get things fixed, even out of warranty, because they were loyal, and nissan would allow things to be covered under warranty in certain situations.just wanted to point that out...-thene   \"Sonata seems a hodgepodge of borrowed elements from both the Accord, old Camry, and the Lexus\\'.\"Goes to show that there\\'s very little ingenuity left in mid-sized cars. The next-gen Accord looks an awful lot like this gen. Sonata with a bit of Optima thrown in. I\\'m not particularly enamored with the new Camry but it\\'s a much better looking car than the last gen. car which had a real strange looking c-pillar and heavy rear end. Think the Sonata is far better looking than that car, although less distinctive than the previous one.  Fusion looks very stealthy with the black grill, very nice. However Ford should have taken it a step futher and maybe offered smoked head and tail lights to match.  \"Sonata seems a hodgepodge of borrowed elements from both the Accord, old Camry, and the Lexus\\'.\" Sonata is a colaboration of many vehicles, as most are this day and age. Sonata has a me too cookie cutter design to appeal to the masses, but IMO in top trim this car has a very sleek and sophisticated look, and looks like nothing else ive seen before. Hyundai does need to seriously update the interior however, the gauges and center stack look awfully dated.  Fusion looks very stealthy with the black grill, very nice. However Ford should have taken it a step futher and maybe offered smoked head and tail lights to match.I happen to like the chrome (well, it\\'s plastic actually) grille on the Fusions. Then again, I think the 1959 Cadillac was a beautiful automobile.  Hyundai does need to seriously update the interior however, the gauges and center stack look awfully dated. Hyundai styling is an oxymoron. They\\'ve done a great job with the mechanicals, but their designs seem to share the touch of a German jazz band.  I realize some like the chrome, but why can\\'t Ford do like Mazda...on the versions of the 6 that have chrome grill, the body colored one can be purchased as an accessory for $100.I would like the idea of adding smoked headlights and tailights along with a black chrome grill...and take the chrome off the windows, too. But, anyway, I solved all my issues with the Fusion\\'s appearance by just getting the Mazda6  .  The Sonata\\'s dash may be the least attractive of any in their lineup now. I think for the \\'09 mid-gen refresh we\\'ll see something more along the lines of what\\'s in the Santa Fe and Veracruz, i.e. much sleeker and more upscale. At least, Hyundai will do that if they are smart.  I solved all my issues with the Fusion\\'s appearance by just getting the Mazda6.Good solution. Our solution to the plainness of the Asian models was to buy a Fusion. So we are both satisfied.   Yea the Veracruz is a looker, but that Santa Fe seems a bit bloated. Both better looking than the Sonata. Redo the front end, rework the dash, fix the below average driver\\'s seat. That should breathe some life into the less than expected (?) Sonata sales.I\\'m anxious to see how the Sonata ages with say, 85,000 miles on it. If this new generation car passes that long term test, I think you\\'ll see more and more Sonatas on the road.That\\'s what will sell me at least. Car\\'s just coming out (Sonata, Fusion) and getting these great initial reviews, when everybody knows its what happens in years 5+ that define the car. Camcords have passed that test.  Where do the next gen Accord and Sonata share looks outside of maybe the front end? Which is a design that Honda ALWAYS used before the current Genereation Accord. The only resemblances I can see are maybe the front grille. Accords have always had long horizontal styled headlights up front. Even the Euro Accord aka the TSX continues that trend. So it would seem that the element of front end styling is something Hyundai stole from Honda.The rear end o the next Accord looks nothing like the Sonata, the sides definitely dont. I could see if someone said the next Accord favored the BMW 5Series, but the Sonata? I don\\'t see it. Please explain.  when everybody knows its what happens in years 5+ that define the car. Camcords have passed that test.An excellent point, Goodegg, but the journey to five-year reliability has to start with the first step and the Fusion, at least, is off to a very good start, two years without major problems or recalls of any sort.As a proud Fusion owner, I sure hope this trend continues and the Fusions remain trouble free. Yup, the Camcords do have an enviable record, one that will be difficult, maybe, to equal. At least FoMoCo has started off on the right footing with the Fusion.  For some, 5 year reliability may be a good test. However, my personal test is 10+ years under normal driving conditions. I generally keep my new cars for 12 to 15 years, and have three cars that rotate through that schedule. However, I still have an \\'85 SAAB 900 4-door sedan that I purchased in April of 1985 that\\'s still going strong, both from an exterior and interior aesthetic point-of-view, and mechanically as well. Even the carpet floor mats are still in excellent condition, and this is with well over a quarter of a million miles. Except for normal wear and tear items, it\\'s only had 1 clutch replacement, and absolutely no other work on the engine or 5-speed manual transmission. It does leak a few drops of oil, but doesn\\'t use any between 3K changes. Others, their \"mileage\" certainly may vary, but this has been one rugged and reliable machine for over 22 years.  I could see if someone said the next Accord favored the BMW 5SeriesI don\\'t see that at all. I actually see a kind of Catera/GrandAm rear and a Scion front.It looks like a Cagrasci.  It definately favors the 5 series.  I can see the Scion front, especially on the coupe. I just don\\'t see any Grand Am though.  As some of my Midsize sedans buddies know, I got hit last week in my 1996 Accord. Well, a few little gremlins have reared their ugly heads since the wreck in that car. I was driving it to work daily, until I realized my interior lights had stopped working in conjunction with my headlights (no gauges lit up, no A/C controls, my clock didn\\'t get dimmer, etc...)Then two evenings ago, I realized the taillights were not illuminating either. The brakelights still work, but now, the only things working \"light-wise\" are both high-beams, the driver side low-beam, and the blinkers. The parking light on the driver\\'s side has decided to quit working, as well.My estimate for repair was just over $1,200, by the way. I don\\'t care if it is high or low - the other driver who caused the accident had insurance, which is footing the bill.  I see a very strong hint of 5 Series  I see a very strong hint of 5 SeriesI don\\'t see any Bangle in it.  $1200 to fix it, that seems real low priced compared to CT. It seems to be $600 here if you scratch your bumper. I haven\\'t check lately, but I think the hourly rate for body shop work is about $65 per hour, plus parts, paint (much more expensive than house paint) and \"hazardous waste\" disposal. A crumpled fender (assuming bumper damage, lights[front or rear] and alignment of hood or trunk usually fruns over $1200 in CT, before any electrical problems such as you describe.  Well, the hood isn\\'t misaligned, and the bumper and hood are actually only going to have to be \"refinished.\" They are slightly marred on the edges of the panels, but not dented or really even scratched. The hourly rate listed on my estimate is $42. The hourly rate of work at my dealer (for service/repairs) is $70, so i was pleased.The estimated labor charge was $620. The rest was parts/paint/disposal.You can see the damage for yourself here, and more are on my CarSpace page.See more Car Pictures at CarSpace.com  $1200 to fix it, that seems real low priced compared to CT.Seems pretty low for anywhere to me. Have you seen some of their previous work?  Well, they are the preferred body shop from GMAC insurance, the company the other driver carries (and who is paying for it). The collision center we have used in the past has recently changed hands, so that trust is no longer necessarily there.My grandfather also carried his Frontier there back in 2002 to have it inspected before purchase (it was used, its a 1999 model). They have been in this location for years, and its one of these \"my grandmother goes to church with the owner\\'s mother\" kind of places. They have a very large garage and are very popular in my town. I trust their work based on good word-of-mouth.  Just a little advise. Don\\'t expect a perfect/un-detectable repair, and you will not be disappointed.   Don\\'t worry, I don\\'t expect perfect.This is repair number three in four years(yet none have been deemed my fault!). One came from running over a freakin\\' shovel in the road! The other came from being run into a guardrail (Something that did a LOT of damage). I\\'ve been throughly pleased with the work done on my car by our old collision center however. The paint has matched pretty darn well when it has been done (the front half of the car has been painted). It is only obvious in very certain lighting conditions however.  This is repair number three in four years(yet none have been deemed my fault!). Haha, I know what you mean. My old BRIGHT RED TRUCK, seemed to be invisible to other motorists, because they were constantly pulling out in front of, or running into the side of it. :confuse:  I haven\\'t seen bumper covers \"refinished\" before (which mean repainted). Any gouges will remain visible, they\\'ll just be painted over. Be careful on the hood as well, since you don\\'t want nice paint on a deformed hood. Having said that, as long as the shop will 100% guarantee the work, don\\'t worry about it. You want the car fixed properly whether the cost is $1200 or $2,000 (but you don\\'t want the car totaled.)  Nothing is actually dented other than the quarter panel, and I\\'m getting a new one of those. The shop has a good reputation in the community, so I\\'d be inclined to believe I won\\'t have too many problems with them (knocking on wood as I type). Everything still aligned properly. He hit me \"just right\" in that only one panel of the car was affected. He was higher than the bumper of my car, and lower than the hood. Just perfectly even with my parking light (as you can see).  For some, 5 year reliability may be a good test. However, my personal test is 10+ years under normal driving conditions.I\\'d have to agree that expecting 5+ years of reliable service is what I would expect when buying a new car, but I can\\'t see where I could make the assumption that since I, or someone else I knew, had a reliable 10 year old car that the same make and/or model would necessarily be just as reliable. First, I don\\'t know of any 10 year reliability date to use so coming up with decent data to draw any conclusions from would be difficult. Second, every new model with substantial changes from previous generations usually will have unique strengths and weaknesses that are sometimes impossible to forsee until lots of time goes by. Just because a ten year old ford had a good 3 speed automatic tranny, has nothing to do with whether the current gen 6 speed automatic will be as good.Third, companies change. Mercedes used to make very solid cars. While they seem to be improving from the recent woes lately, they were having some quality probs for several years. And Hyundai... changes as extreme as what they have been able to do in just a few years (granted, drawing a firm conclusion may still be a tiny bit premature), just goes to show how quickly a company can improve. While I understand what you\\'re saying...some manufacturers have a long track record of consistently making automobiles that rank high for reliability over a 5 year period (which I think is the longest period for which reliability is tracked by major organizations - plz correct me if I\\'m wrong here). But the trend over the last 10 years has been one of increasing quality by the vast majority of manufacturers to the point where the difference is often less than a single problem over a five year period. This is the great thing about buying a car now... for the most part, a person can focus on things like ride quality, funtionality, style, or whatever that is important to them without getting overly obsessed with manufacturing quality. Instead of making just a \"safe\" choice and compromising on what they really want, buyers of midsize sedans can now safely make a choice that better reflects their desires and personality. I\\'m not saying don\\'t do your research, but at the same time, don\\'t put too much weight in colored circles without knowing exactly what those colored cirles mean and the numbers they actually represent.  \"I\\'m anxious to see how the Sonata ages with say, 85,000 miles on it. If this new generation car passes that long term test, I think you\\'ll see more and more Sonatas on the road.\" \"That\\'s what will sell me at least. Car\\'s just coming out (Sonata, Fusion) and getting these great initial reviews, when everybody knows its what happens in years 5+ that define the car. Camcords have passed that test.\"Based on our family & co-workers experiences with Hyundai they will be running along just fine @ 85K miles and many more. We own a 2000 Elantra which my son drives to work (100 mile round trip daily). It currently has 158,000 miles and the total repairs aside from routine items e.g. brake pads/rotors..tires...timing belt replacement was a new alternator and battery about 10,000 miles ago and a new flex joint in the exhaust system, which is original otherwise. Three co-workers have Hyundai products and I keep abreast of their experiences due to my own interest in the company and its products. Anyhow, there are two Santa Fe\\'s and one newer Elantra in that group. Both Santa Fe\\'s have over 100,000 miles (one 4 cylinder and one 2.7 V-6)and as far as I have been told both are trouble free.The 2004 Elantra goes about 80 miles a day round trip and currently has over 60,000 miles. It had a faulty digital instrument when new and Hyundai replaced the instrument cluster and aside from tires that\\'s it.  So, I believe the Sonata will be just fine with miles and time.  I ask for recommendations . . . Over the years, I have owned American, European and Japanese automobiles. Today, because of my age, I am looking to buy what is most assuredly my final car. I want it to be a American brand mid-size sedan. This is my criteria; I want the car to be luxurious and comfortable, have excellent performance, provide creature comfort technology such as bluetooth and rear camera and lastly, be pleasing to the eye.I have these things in my present Infiniti M45.Is there any American automobile that meets my criteria?Your recommendations are solicited.Thank you.  Let\\'s see...Since this might be your final car it tells me that you are definitely over 60, if not 70 or even older.You want excellent performance and gadgets such as bluetooth and backup camera.You do care about how the car looks (Wow, I wish when I hit your age I can still have this kind of passion for cars)Here\\'s my verdict:You probably won\\'t find any vehicle that fits your \"excellent performance\" criteria among this group of cars. Subaru Legacy and Mazda6 are the closest you\\'ll get but they are just above average performers and neither are American. My recommendation is to check out the upcoming 2008 CTS, which looks very promising and should be reasonably priced (expect to pay 3-series+ price for a 5-series type of car). Another alternative is the refreshed 2008 STS. The cosmetic changes have made the exterior more aggressive and interior more pleasant to look at. Oh, and don\\'t forget Caddy dropped the new 3.6L V6 with 300HP to both the CTS and STS.  a dumb question - why would you possibly even want to get out of your M45? One of the finest sedans out there. It can\\'t be that old. The logical suggestion amoong the American branded is the STS (or CTS) if you\\'ve grown accustomed to the bling, Caddy styling is definitely love it or leave it, but there is also the Lincoln MKZ with a better engine in it than the Fulan/6. Don\\'t think any of the three will have the dynamic qualities of your M, however and also don\\'t believe that the FE savings would amount to much if you put a pencil to it. How much you want for your M? Never mind probably couldn\\'t afford it anyway - the Ms supposed to have great resale values.  Subaru Legacy and Mazda6 are the closest you\\'ll get but they are just above average performers and neither are American.The Mazda6 may very well be more American than the Fusion and any other car compared in this thread though. It is built in Detroit next to the Mustang and the company who\\'s badge is on the grille is controlled by FMC.A MAZDASPEED6 would probably better suit his needs but it is built in Japan making it a lot less American.  Responding to a number of questions, my Infiniti M45 is the best car I have ever owned. But, it is time to trade it in.I am closer to eighty than seventy years of age and am an American who served seven years in the Navy during my youth.At one time, our country produced every item that I purchased. Not today, It seems that today almost everything I buy is made somewhere other than America. My watch is foreign made, my car is foreign made, my tv is foreign made, even most of my clothing is foreign made. As I said, almost everything I own comes from somewhere else.I would like that my last large and significent purchase be an American automobile so that my final splurge of cash pays the salaries of Americans.Many readers may not understand or agree with my thinking, but I have earned the right to think this way and feel very strongly about it.  I don\\'t think you\\'ll get much of an argument about your wish to buy American - it\\'s only when one suggests that their choice is correct for everyone that the hostility heats up. You know what you want to do, so I\\'m hopeful that we can help you find a vehicle that fits your criteria! Have you looked at the Buick LaCrosse?  I would like that my last large and significent purchase be an American automobile so that my final splurge of cash pays the salaries of Americans.GM has more vehicles that are designed and built in the US, while Ford has cars designed here and built elsewhere. An M45 is a pretty big ride, were you thinking along the lines of the Caddy SLS/STS or CTS? Lincoln MKZ? Mercury Motego?I really don\\'t know how to classify Chrysler, but the 300C seemed to make a big splash when it came out, and the hemi V8 responds well to a boot.  I\\'d suggest a LaCrosse with the 3.8 or optional 3.6 L motor and the Lucerne with 3.8 or Northstar. Drive each one to see which you like.  There are a few choices. The LaCrosse mentioned is a possibility, but you may want to check out the Buick Lucerne as well. The Northstar V8 version is powerful, yet it\\'s also big and comfortable.For Chrysler (btw, are they now considered American again?), check out the 300C, but stay away from the lesser versions of the 300.As for Ford, the \\'08 Taurus (Five-Hundred) or \\'08 Sable (Montego) with the new 3.5L may be up your alley. I\\'m not sure if they\\'re out yet, but I did see an \\'08 Taurus with non-dealer plates parked at an apartment complex this past weekend, so they may be slowly trickling into dealers.Hope this helps.  Yes, the \\'08 Taurus is out, I saw them advertised this past weekend in my local paper. Funny thing is, I like the front end on the Five Hundred better.  Yes, the \\'08 Taurus is out, I saw them advertised this past weekend in my local paper. Funny thing is, I like the front end on the Five Hundred better.Not me. I thought the Five Hundred styling was too much like everything else out there. I like the new front end of the Taurus, and it fits well with (and here\\'s my on-topic reference  ) the Fusion.Let\\'s hope that Ford markets it well, especially with the 3.5L.  I would say the Lucerne is a better fit than the Lacrosse. More room and more features, also quite nice looking. A coworker has the Lucerne with the northstar V-8. It is fast and smooth. It even has cooled seats - you can feel it blowing air on you.The Saturn Aura is also quite nice, not sure about all the features.  The chrome bars look better on the Fusion to me (although I\\'m still not crazy about them). On the Taurus, I think they make it look like a chromed Tempo.  The Saturn Aura is also quite nice, not sure about all the features.Aahh, I completely forgot about the Aura. I\\'d avoid the XE and go straight to the XR.  When are you looking to buy your next car? Weeks, months, a year?If you can wait a little while the Lincoln MKS will be available. It is slated to be assembled in Chicago, starting Feb. of \\'08, with the Taurus and Taurus X as they all share the same platform.  You currently have a very nice car. My guess is you\\'ll end up with a Cadillac mostly because it is sexy and can duplicate the features you have with the M45. The Buick Lucerne with the Northstar V-8 and dual pipes is also a nice big car, perhaps larger than you\\'d like. When it\\'s all said and done, you\\'ll ask yourself \"why\\'d I ever get rid of the \"M\". Good luck!  When it\\'s all said and done, you\\'ll ask yourself \"why\\'d I ever get rid of the \"M\".Not if it was the first-gen M45, a car that wasn\\'t exactly setting sales records (or any other records, for that matter).  But it sure made nice taxicabs (in Japan).  a statement out of ignorance? Taxi cabs? The Infiniti M generally rated higher in V6 or V8 forms than the corresponding German sedans and for less money not to mention Cadillacs etc. You need to drive one before you liken it to a taxicab!  exactly. My Avalon apparently 92% American made parts and 100% American labor. Don\\'t believe there is another American branded car that can say that.  Ignorance? I think not. It\\'s a well known fact that the Japanese version of the ORIGINAL M45 was used extensively as taxicabs in Japan. From a 2004 article:Considering that the current iteration of the M45 has been on sale for in Japan for years, often serving duty in taxi fleets, it&#146;s not hard to see why the M45 has been a flop.http://www.automotivearticles.com/123/Infiniti_M45_Europe_Has_a_New_Challenger.shtml  I think the man specifically said he wanted to put as much money as he could into \"American salaries\" on a specific car purchase, didn\\'t he? Would guess, the economic impact of the Fusion is far greater in Mexico than it is in Michigan. At least your 6 is still built here from mostly American made parts.Our erstwhile host, BTW, will NOT want us going here - it is apparently OK to talk about buyer motivations and obviously the cars themselves but it is NOT OK to talk about this particular motivation for some reason :confuse:  while it is not clear whether the M in question is a 2005 or later, this is the car I was talking about - the first version unremarkable (and also smaller) as you suggest. The 2005+ one damn near revolutionary and certainly the best \\'taxicab\\' known to mankind!  Folks, the original poster didn\\'t seem to be looking to get into a debate about what makes a car \"American,\" but if he wants to, he can find a lot of those moved posts over at Buying American Cars - What Does It Mean?  It was clear that the post I was replying to was a picture of the 1st gen M45. Had nothing to do with the original question.  Actually the 5 series was and still is the benchmark of the Luxury Sedans category.  the latest crop of BMWs and MBs have rated relatively poorly recently (for them) primarily because of egronomic issues. Considering the 550 a benchmark, however, is probably correct in as far as it is what any mfgr. of cars this type strive to match or beat - whether it really still is, probably a matter of opinion. I do have some \\'gadget freak\\' friends that actually LIKE \\'i-drive\\'.  Like the mechanic says, \"pay me a little now, or a lot later\". Serveral of you have given great example of how ATROCIOUSLY negligent and careless maintenance can ruin a vehicle.\\'However, getting my transmission fluid changed at 15K intervals (or 30K intervals in the Honda) didn\\'t help either faulty automatic transmission. In fact, it probably hurt, as one died at 60 or so thousand miles, when it was due for it\\'s 3rd or 4th change, and the Honda tranny started to fail at 42K, 12K after the first auto tranny fluid change. A lot of problems are from design, engineering, and build quality issues, not maintenance. I mean, what causes head gaskets to go at 40K miles? That\\'s \"virtually brand new\" condition on a Honda.The companies that tell you \"tough luck\" are the one\\'s I like to say \"tough luck\" to when they are fired or laid off due to downsizing.  If it was out of warranty then they had no reason to. Honda\\'s tranny failures were of a different nature and happened early on in the vehicles life in a lot of cases which prompted them to extend the warranty. That\\'s why your Honda transmission was replaced. Dodge\\'s trannies didn\\'t last significantly longer than Honda\\'s transmissions, I can assure you of that! My Honda was most definitely out of warranty, having 42,000 miles before problems surfaced. It was a 3 year 36K powertrain warranty back then. They stepped right up to fix it. Why? Embarrassment, character, integrity, honesty, sense of fairness, and wanting me to remain a customer; forward thinking!Dodge\\'s auto tranny problems were early failures, and happened in numerous cases, same thing as Honda. Just a different response.Honda: we\\'ll fix it, we\\'ll extend warranties, we\\'ll cover you.Dodge: parts just break down, cars just break down, tough luck!  My co-worker told me that he heard in Germany lots of taxi use MB cars. They are so unreliable that Taxi drivers refused to use MB because drivers would lose business if the car often quits...  However, getting my transmission fluid changed at 15K intervals (or 30K intervals in the Honda) didn\\'t help either faulty automatic transmission. In fact, it probably hurt,Unless the transmission was power flushed, I don\\'t think it can \"hurt\" it. A lot of problems are from design, engineering, and build quality issues, not maintenance.I agree that some failures will happen, no matter what you do. I don\\'t want to add \"lack of maintenance\" to the reasons why it could fail though.  the other place I saw a whole lot of MB cabs - Hong Kong. Don\\'t know if they\\'ve changed because of reliability issues, but you might think they would do better with those plain vanilla antiquated Crown Vics. In the far east cab driving would be a job that one aspires to!  Your right, plenty of cars fail because of bad design, engineering and build quality. But usually, those types of problems will show up well before the warranty expires. But at any rate, it does happen. My only point is that newer care, if properly maintained, will last damn near forever. as other people have said, the difference between the best cars, and the worst; has narrowed significantly. I mean, what causes head gaskets to go at 40K miles? That\\'s \"virtually brand new\" condition on a Honda. an engine running hot will often times damage the head gasket.  an engine running hot will often times damage the head gasket. But if the reason the engine was running hot was because it was low on coolant because the head gasket was leaking coolant? What then... chicken and the egg?  BMW should get Apple to redo iDrive for them... the rest of the industry will be in huge trouble then.  Dodge\\'s auto tranny problems were early failures, and happened in numerous cases, same thing as Honda. Just a different response. Honda: we\\'ll fix it, we\\'ll extend warranties, we\\'ll cover you. Dodge: parts just break down, cars just break down, tough luck! I\\'m pretty sure Honda\\'s transmission failures were being looked into by the NHTSA though, simply because of the nature of the failures. One thing Honda seems to do well is avoid recalls by taking action before a recall is issued if they can. I think these transmission issues were a perfect example of that.IIRC the Honda failures in the Accord and other models induced wheel lock regardless of where you were or what speed you were travelling at. That\\'s not so safe if you\\'re on the highway. :surprise: If the NHTSA deemed the vehicles safe enough that Honda could get away with an extended warranty rather than a recall then I have no problem with that. Just don\\'t believe that Honda or any other company is out to help you out. They had their best interest in mind, with the tranny situation and all the others as well, as a profitable business and you can take that to the bank.I knew three other \\'97 or \\'98 Civic owners who bought theirs shortly after we bought our \\'96 and all of them had problems with the driver\\'s side window and the exhaust system. Each part failed like clockwork. It was rather interesting to be able to predict their problems and see them just shrug them off like I was crazy. They were known issues to all forum regulars so why didn\\'t Honda step up there? Do they sell so many Accords that they didn\\'t care which mid-sized vehicle we stepped up to?  IIRC the Honda failures in the Accord and other models induced wheel lock regardless of where you were or what speed you were travelling at.Not sure about that. I had always heard the trannies defaulted to second gear.  some spy shots of the Accord interior  is that a 6 speed? drool...  Not sure about that. I had always heard the trannies defaulted to second gear.Drops to 2nd gear or total disengagement (ie. no more power, but no wheel lock either).http://cl.acurazine.com/forums/showthread.php?t=98260I had something similar happened on my old Ford Taurus - that\\'s why I got rid of it... not sure if it was transmission or something with the engine/fuel delivery, but it wasn\\'t totally terminal in my case. Just total loss of power when accelerating while at speed (it would happen at times, and never from a stop), so like power dips to zero, and in 2-3 seconds it comes back, so it was disconcerting and rather dangerous (since you\\'re typically accelerating when you need to).  OK. I know this is off-topic but have you seen what edmunds said about the 535? If you read their commentary, they did not rate it poorly, in fact quite the opposite. And if you are referring to anything else, the 5 series has been eating up the competition in sales. So whatever has been said about the 5 series, the hapless consumers don\\'t give a hoot.I happen to like i-drive. I learned to navigate it in about 15 seconds doing 50 mph. :shades  Drops to 2nd gear or total disengagement (ie. no more power, but no wheel lock either). I may have been going by the recall notice below but it was a long time ago that I researched this issue. I recall stories on Accord threads of wheels locking up on the highway as well but we have to take those with a grain of salt of course.

Make: HONDA Model: ACCORD Year: 2003 Complaint Number: 10143399 Summary: A RECALL NOTICE WAS RECEIVED BY ME FROM HONDA. I TOOK MY CAR TO HONDA AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD INSPECT THE TRANSMISSION. AFTER INSPECTION THEY SAID THERE WAS NO DAMAGE AND THEY SAID THEY INSTALLED A SUPPLEMENTAL COOLING JET. 9 MONTHS LATER I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION AND THE TRANSMISSION FAILED. HONDA REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION WITH A REBUILT ONE BUT THEY WILL NOT COVER THE LABOR COST AND THEY ALSO WILL NOT VERIFY THAT THE REBUILT TRANSMISSION IS ANY BETTER DESIGN THAN THE ORIGINAL WHICH FAILED. THE RECALL ID # IS 04V176000. THE HONDA CASE # IS N012005-09-2200467. *NM This one resulted in an injury. These are all on the NHTSA\\'s site if you search for complaints on the 2003 Honda Accord.Make: HONDA Model: ACCORD Year: 2003 Complaint Number: 10149685 Summary: TRANSMISSION FAILURE RESULTING IN LOCKUP AND IMMEDIATE, UNEXPECTED STOP. *NM I know other mfrs have had their issues too but please stop believing that Honda is some squeaky clean company that is out to save all of us. What level of service you receive all boils down to the dealer IMO.Are we done with this yet. Does anyone still doubt me?  \"Are we done with this yet. Does anyone still doubt me?\"Not quite. Out of the millions and millions of cars sold by Honda, there is no way 100% satisfaction can be achieved. No manufacturer will have 100% satisfaction, you can always find one consumer who thinks they were wronged in some way.I\\'m of the opinion also that Honda generally stands by it\\'s products, from what I\\'ve seen in the past. That item is now four years old, if that complaint was registered this year, I think it is a fair deal on both sides, considering the vehicle is four years old. At least, unlike a similiar Ford issue, Honda did not say: \"Nothing I can do\".  well looks like someone removed the picture of the interior... search for the temple of vtec and you can see some pictures. Looks pretty decent to me, though some are comparing it to the Civic. Personally I think it\\'s a bit better... at least the dash isn\\'t a parking lot. I like the design of the doors... not too generic and some good flow though somewhat complex yet simple. Steering wheel has gotten kinda out there, but I like it. Hope it drives well!  There are Ford dealers that don\\'t say that. Ford sells a LOT more vehicles than Honda and has a lot more dealers than they do. Obviously you are going to hear more complaints for Ford but I think most dealer satisfaction surveys show that Ford dealers are better. All mfrs pay for repairs out of warranty if pursued to do so in the right way by the right people. That\\'s where a great dealer comes in. All mfrs also extend warranties on common problems like the Accord for Honda and the Focus for Ford for example. It is very misleading to someone who reads this thread looking for advise because they might be led to believe that Honda will fix anything for them at any time during the life of the car if they buy one. That\\'s plain false. It\\'s case by case and that\\'s for any mfr.  Here\\'s the link to the pics of the interior. You get to the other two by following the link in the update from June 15th. Looks like the inside of the MDX and RDX but with fewer buttons which is a good thing. However, the buttons in this Accord are all still of similar shape and size which takes your eyes off of the road. Will it have climate and audio controls on the wheel like the Fusion? That would help the sea of buttons issue at least.I think you asked if that was a 6-speed zzzoom6? It\\'s not according to TOV because this is apparently an I4 sedan. Still only 5 gears for that engine. I\\'d guess the V6 will still have 6 gears though.  Second gear is not a good default gear when your going 75! LOL... it does induce a \"I just got rear ended\" type feel.  Furthermore, I believe people might try to take advantage of recalls by claiming their own \"at fault\" accident was really caused by some \"mechanical glitch.\" There is overwhelming reason and motivation to blame the accident on something else other than driver error.Either way.... I had the jet installed at around 32K, and the tranny still failed at 42K, and they paid for a brand new tranny and the labor, and the rental, and did it in 2 days. The Honda dealer hooked up the rental and doing it quickly. AMerican HONDA hooked up the new tranny and paying for the labor, all the while extending the warranty to cover it. That was a Honda representatives decision, independent from my dealer. The dealer may have put in a good word for me... but ultimately it was not the dealer\\'s decision.What was strange is they told me the tranny looked as good as new during the inspection.... yet it failed 10K miles later. I have a feeling the recall decision to put in a jet was knowingly done because it might work on 90% of the cars with problems. They knew the other 10% would need complete replacements later. But thats cheaper than replacing all 100% to begin with.  No one removed the picture you posted at 2354 - it\\'s there!  It is a case by case basis, however, Honda is well known to stand behind their products, and the domestics are well known to not do that.Recent situation similar to my Accords\\' tranny failure for a friend of mine... with her Landrover. The tranny died RIGHT after the warranty was over, and the thing was a lemon, had been into the dealer MANY many times. Well, once 50K hit, they said too bad so sad to her, she appealed, wrote letters, did everything she could do and did it right, but Landrover\\'s response might as well have said \"We don\\'t care about repeat business one iota!\"  That was a Honda representatives decision, independent from my dealer. The dealer may have put in a good word for me... but ultimately it was not the dealer\\'s decision. Right. Like I said, it all starts with a good dealer. If you wrote a letter to Honda or called them about the problem they would refer you to a dealer first. It\\'s not like they go around spending money on people\\'s problems just because they are nice.  It is a case by case basis, however, Honda is well known to stand behind their products, and the domestics are well known to not do that.I think you are reading too many Honda forums. :P It is not widely known that Honda stands by their products more than other mfrs nor are there any data to support that statement that I know of. Dodge paid for the two transmissions my sister needed replaced in her Caravan when out of warranty. Are they a mfr you know of to stand by their vehicles too? If it\\'s \"case by case\" like we\\'ve both stated then how is one better than the other when they both have the same procedures?  Because I know of Dodge\\'s \"parts just break down\" policy, first hand! That is what they told me. The only thing Dodge ever paid for was a new battery, and that was only because there own car damaged the battery, and it was the Dodge dealer himself who was doing service to the car!  you might be right... I got nasty and serious on Honda\\'s [non-permissible content removed] earlier in my ownership period when they couldn\\'t get the window molding trim on the window sill fixed right. It kept rippling in the heat/sun/water of the weather since it was an exterior trim/molding piece, it was very Unserious.However, after 4 dealer visits I put them on notice that I was going to have them buy the car back under the lemon law (requires 4 visits for minor problems) if they didn\\'t get it right and get it right soon. Anyway, there stalling and delaying (claming parts were backordered) quickly ceased, as AMerican Honda told me they had 400 in stock. The problem was fixed immediately.  It is very misleading to someone who reads this thread looking for advise because they might be led to believe that Honda will fix anything for them at any time during the life of the car if they buy one. That\\'s plain false.But I don\\'t think it\\'s misleading to say IMO, Honda and Honda dealers generally stands by it\\'s products and try to do the right thing with the customers. My Ford dealer was extremely nice, I rated them highly. What I didn\\'t rate highly was Ford in support of their cars, and their inablility to stand by their products even with known issues.  All this talk about dealers and service departments has me thinking. I have been driving Accords for 16 years now, and as far as I\\'m concerned, my local dealer doesn\\'t need a service department. Do they even have a Service Department? Can\\'t say for sure. The only time I go to the local Honda dealer is to pick up maintenance items, and check out the new models. It is an Accord, after all.  If I owned another brand, I would be concerned.  All this talk about dealers and service departments has me thinking.

The only time I go to the local Honda dealer is to pick up maintenance items, and check out the new models. It is an Accord, after all. If I owned another brand, I would be concerned.Well you are very lucky, in 10 years the local Honda dealer in CA couldn\\'t fix the rear door handle so the door would open reliably, took them 2 tries to replace the power window motor, and took multiple visits to get the AC repaired. Luckily these were all warranty visits initially.  Heard a funny story yesterday about a Honda Accord that got stolen twice in the same day and incredibly they caught both thieves! The funnier thing is that the first Accord thief drew attention to himself by racing another Accord that got away, but after running the plates, it too was a stolen car!!Same Honda stolen twice in one dayNever thought about it much when I had my two Accords, but both of them were broken into. My Subie never got touched, even when I left my door open at a Home Depot (one of my not so good moments :confuse: ). It appears that the Accord along with the Camry are among the most stolen, though the years of these models is pretty old. I remember once when I left my keys in my Accord, I was amazed at how easily the AAA person was able to unlock it. Given how many of these cars are on the road, I would imagine more poplular cars would be more likely to get stolen. And unless the thief does something really dumb to draw attention to themselves, it would be harder to track down a stolen accord or camry since they are everywhere. Anyway, just a thought...  It may or may not be a concern to a potential car buyer as to how often that particular model is stolen, but I know that insurance companies keep a close eye on those type of lists. Any excuse for them to raise their premiums...  All this talk about dealers and service departments has me thinking. I have been driving Accords for 16 years now, and as far as I\\'m concerned, my local dealer doesn\\'t need a service department. Do they even have a Service Department?A friend of ours has worked as the service mgr at a Honda, Ford, Lincoln/Mercury, Dodge, and now Kia dealer. He claims the Honda service dept. was every bit as busy as any of the others. And not just for oil changes either because I know that\\'s what you are thinking. BTW, service mgrs make pretty darn good money so don\\'t feel bad if you have to yell at them. :P  Any excuse for them to raise their premiums...If a higher percentage of vehicle A is stolen (thus resulting in an insurance claim) than vehicle B then doesn\\'t it make sense that vehicle A would have a higher premium?Not saying everything they use to increase premiums makes sense but I think this one definitely does.  But I don\\'t think it\\'s misleading to say IMO, Honda and Honda dealers generally stands by it\\'s products and try to do the right thing with the customers.I agree, but too often it is stated as a blanket fact. It might be a fact that someone had a better experience with one mfr over the other mfr but that should only be used to form their opinion and should thus be stated that way. Honda has a certain reputation as do the other mfrs. But based on those reps we can\\'t just assume that everything is always peachy when dealing with the former, and everything is a nightmare when dealing with some of the latter mfrs. I feel everyone has the right to buy the best vehicle for them. What makes them happy if you will. Stating opinion as fact could sway someone the \"wrong\" way by making them think they\\'ll only be happy with product H when in fact Products A-F and I-Z fit the bill too. Depending on their definition of happiness of course.  yeah - happiness begins with an \"N\" in my world...Nissan Maxima, Nissan Z, Nissan GTR...(i guess it would begin with an \"I\" too...)Infiniti G35, Infiniti G37, Infiniti M45...-thene   I think maybe Honda Service Departments need multiple attempts to fix problems because they get so little experience in fixing problems on Hondas!   How about instead of vehicle A having an increase in premiums.... vehicle B (which is stolen less) have a DECREASE in premiums. What a novel idea.. I wonder why greedy Insurance companies haven\\'t thought of this! :P  OK. So let me say it this way. No manufacturer will please 100% of it\\'s customers 100% of the time. There are certain cases, some more so than others, when manufacturers will do the right thing. No manufacturer will do the right thing 100% of the time, however.Opinions are only facts when they are true.  Actually come to think of it, it has recently been in 2x for an oil leak and is about to go in for the third time (first time was catastrophic failure of a counterbalance seal, second time was to take care of a seal that didn\\'t seat when they did the service the first time, and now it is still leaking but I think its where the dipstick tube mounts to the crankcase).I\\'m not complaining about the repair it self, the car is old and has 140k, but it seems to take a few shots to get it right.The first dealer in CA was generally regarded as being incompetent (they didn\\'t tighten the drain plug on another vehicle after an oil change, etc), but the one in MI is supposed to be good.  Increase or decrease is meaningless without a starting point.The whole premise of an Insurance company being for-profit is a problem since every dollar they can get out of paying is a dollar more profit to their bottom line. I think insurance should be non-profit so that excess funds go back to the insured and not into someone\\'s pocket.But it is reasonable that there is a difference in premiums based on probability of theft.  Opinions are only facts when they are true. An opinion can never be a fact. One might have an opinion which coincides with a fact but then you still need the fact to back it up.No manufacturer will please 100% of it\\'s customers 100% of the time. There are certain cases, some more so than others, when manufacturers will do the right thing. No manufacturer will do the right thing 100% of the time, however. Do you see the difference between that and saying that a specific mfr IS better than all the others. Especially when there is absolutely no factual evidence of that being so?There are no published factual data of an Accord being better than a Fusion or vice versa but at least we have some statistics based guides to help us along.   I think insurance should be non-profit so that excess funds go back to the insured and not into someone\\'s pocket. A lot of insurance companies are just that...they are called \"mutual\" which means they are technically owned by the policy holders and make no profits. However, I doubt this structure prevents them from paying big bucks to the executives, just like plenty of executives working for charitable non-profits make plenty.I don\\'t really care what the structure is, I care about what I pay and what kind of service I get.  And those mutual companies pay out the same big bucks in claim settlements as the stock companies.Mutual companies used to pay dividends to their shareholders/policyholders. But, with ever increasing reserve requirements and government regulations, dividends went away (at least in CT) about 30 years ago for most mutual companies.  Non-Profits have a nasty habit of blowing a ton of money on less than direct costs!  But it is reasonable that there is a difference in premiums based on probability of theft. Of course the make and model car you have is less important than where you live. In Thibodaux Louisiana, cars are not stolen very often. I\\'m sure Insurance companies do take that into account.  . I think insurance should be non-profit so that excess funds go back to the insured and not into someone\\'s pocket. horrible idea. there is nothing wrong with profit. competetion keeps rates from getting out of hand. Granted, its a pain in the [non-permissible content removed] changing insurance every year or two, but it will deffinitly keep your premiums down. buying insurance isn\\'t much different than buying a car. if you don\\'t shop arround, and you don\\'t fight for the best deal............your going to get screwed.  I\\'m going to ask \"when did this become an insurance discussion?\" We must need the Accord to come out SOON to kick-start a conversation!  LOL, grad.BTW, when is the 2008 Accord supposed to make its grand appearance? Anybody know?  I believe an Accord is better than a Fusion in the absolute sense. I have never said otherwise that it wasn\\'t an opinion. I have some facts and opinions to back up that assertion.I believe Honda does the right thing more often than not and more than Ford. That might be a fact, but I can\\'t prove it (but it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not a fact)  While salivating about the new Accord, let\\'s not forget about a couple of other important debuts coming soon to a dealer near you: Malibu, and Mazda6. I am actually looking forward more to the new Mazda6 than the Accord. Accord is predictable: a little more refined version of what we\\'ve seen before, with some nips and tucks. The new Mazda6 appears to be a significant styling departure from the old car, much larger, with much more power under the hood. Hopefully Mazda won\\'t forget the zoom zoom. Malibu is interesting because it will tell us if GM can continue on their upward path in family sedans, which they started with the Aura.  The new models usually come out around September or October. You will probably see a lot of advertising about the new Accord by August. Honda is famous for teasing you in their commercials, giving you a little more information, and letting you see a little more each week or so.  I\\'m worried they made the Mazda6 too big and or too thirsty. I guess we will see what happens if it really gets the 3.5l or not, and how big it really is. If I wanted to drive a bus, I would drive a bus.I think that is what bumped the Accord down on my list, it just feels like any other midsized car. The Altima feels tighter to me, but I can\\'t seem to find it equipped the way I would like.  Here\\'s a rendering of the 09 Fusion and according to those who have seen the real thing this is pretty close. What do you think?  What concerns me about Mazda is that they aren\\'t always consistent...They give us the 3, a GREAT runner up to the Protege, and then throw the Tribute at us. The 626 was a dullard, and the 6 was great, but the Mazda5 is the answer to a question nobody asked (underpowered station wagon with sliding doors).I dunno, but I don\\'t just \"count on\" the next 6 being a big hit like the current Mazda 3 is. On the other hand, Honda has found a winning formula and sticks fairly close to it each time. While it doesn\\'t make for a super-exciting release, it does make me look forward to what technological advancements will come to one-up the competition (A-Vtec for one).  Allen, the rendering of the 2009 Fusion is most interesting. It sure will make our 2007 seem more dated. At least the taillights are improved.While the 2006-08 Fusions featured bold and distinctive styling, the 2009 rendering makes the Fusion look downright aggressive and more like the Edge.I would also guess that the \\'09 will get the 3.5-liter V6 since the \\'08s won\\'t.  one thing to keep in mind about the likely bigger and heavier Mazda6, the current MazdaSpeed6 is a few hundred pounds heavier than the standard 6, but still handles very well. Granted, AWD is probably increasing grip around corners, but still, the Speed6 carries it\\'s extra heft quite nicely both in terms of handling and comfort. Even with the CX7 and CX9, mazda has been getting props for handling compared to their peers, so I don\\'t doubt that Mazda\\'s engineers know how to keep a heavier car under control and in balance. When it comes down to it, I seriously doubt mazda would make the new 6 be the heaviest in this class regardless of what it wants to do to make the 6 more appealing to a larger segment. But as grad mentioned, I think there\\'s an outside chance that mazda might soften the 6. In the end though, the direction mazda is heading toward is an identity that embraces passionate driving. I have a feeling the 6 will be working toward finding the balance and composure of a 3-series bmw while being more family-friendly. If mazda can keep the fun and functionality in the family daily driver like I think they currently have in the Mazda6 while giving it a bit more space and power, it could be a great thing. Actually, I think Mazda\\'s biggest challenge is how to market a sporty midsize car... too many prospective buyers in this segment would probably be turned off by performance oriented sedan since most of the public views performance and comfort/practicality as being mutually exclusive. Mazda needs to find a way to say to buyers in this segment in a convincing manner, \"You can have it all.\" To me, that\\'s the brilliance of BMW\\'s marketing... they\\'ve tied performance with the other traits of luxury, comfort, and refinement together in a very appealing and desireable product. Zoom-zoom speaks too much to youthful exuberance when most of the buyers of midsize cars are looking for something more refined and mature. the 6 already is a great product (of course I think this...which is why I bought one), I just think they need to adjust their marketing to reach the audience that actually buys these midsizers.  Hard to do, but I think the nose of the \\'09 is worse than on the current Fusion. Too much chrome for my taste. The rear looks OK although only the chrome stick-on on the trunk (oh, let\\'s stick some chrome on there too!) keeps it looking like many, many other cars (Daewoos come to mind).   Zoom-zoom speaks too much to youthful exuberance when most of the buyers of midsize cars are looking for something more refined and mature. The Zoom-Zoom is obviously directed at younger buyers. To the 40-ish segment a kid saying Zoom-Zoom, makes it sound like they are selling a toy car.  I actually like the front, and I see hints of previous generation Camry in the back (which I\\'m neutral on). To get something close to the artist\\'s rendition though would require an Eibach sportline kit and 18s.  If you don\\'t get \"zoom zoom\", you don\\'t get it.There are some older drivers (like me for instance) who don\\'t mind some sportiness (good handling, sleek styling) along with refinement in a mid-sized car. No reason mid-sized cars need to be merely a transportation appliance.  The Zoom-Zoom is obviously directed at younger buyers. To the 40-ish segment a kid saying Zoom-Zoom, makes it sound like they are selling a toy car.Oh I definitely agree, I think Honda did the same thing in the 90s trying to appeal to the 30s crowd, and now all those people are in their 40s and buy out of loyalty. I think the BMW 3 series is similar in this respect (which is why they are coming out with a 1 series), and for Toyota it got so bad they had to invent Scion to get kids to look at the cars.  They give us the 3, a GREAT runner up to the Protege, and then throw the Tribute at us.That\\'s Fords fault. Mazda doesn\\'t have their own resources to create an \"entry-level\" SUV, and Ford simply dropped the ball with the revised Escape/Tribute.Besides, both the CX-7 and CX-9 has been very popular with the car mags, and I\\'ve heard nothing but positive comments from new owners. ...but the Mazda5 is the answer to a question nobody asked (underpowered station wagon with sliding doors). Mazda never expected for the 5 to be a big seller, since their intention from the beginning was to import a small amount of them. Despite that, I\\'ve seen a bunch of them on the roads, and the local dealer always seems to sell what few 5s they keep on the lot.I dunno, but I don\\'t just \"count on\" the next 6 being a big hit like the current Mazda 3 is. On the other hand, Honda has found a winning formula and sticks fairly close to it each time.The next 6 should be a winner for Mazda, since a majority of the midsize sedan buyers didn\\'t like the more compact dimensions of the current 6. It\\'ll work if Mazda keeps the \"zoom-zoom\" (the philosophy, not the ad campaign  ).I don\\'t expect the next Accord to be a dud either. In fact, I\\'m sure that it\\'ll test and sell well. It just doesn\\'t exactly stir up any excitement or emotion for me (and other enthusiasts, I\\'m sure). That\\'s not a shot against the Accord, just my opinion.  If you don\\'t get \"zoom zoom\", you don\\'t get it. There are some older drivers (like me for instance) who don\\'t mind some sportiness (good handling, sleek styling) along with refinement in a mid-sized car. No reason mid-sized cars need to be merely a transportation appliance.Well said! There are a fair amount of older drivers that post on the Mazda forums. They all pretty much say the same thing: They need a family sedan, but have grown tired and bored of all the \"vanilla\" cars. They want something sporty, yet practical.  Oh I definitely agree, I think Honda did the same thing in the 90s trying to appeal to the 30s crowd, and now all those people are in their 40s and buy out of loyalty.So Mazda is doing the same thing, hoping that current 3 or 6 owners will stay loyal to the brand and buy another 6, or the CX-7 or CX-9. Whats wrong with that?  So Mazda is doing the same thing, hoping that current 3 or 6 owners will stay loyal to the brand and buy another 6, or the CX-7 or CX-9. Whats wrong with that?Nothing, thats what they should do.  To my taste, that \\'09 Fusion would be an improvement. It loses lower section of chrome grill and the headlights are more staying in front plane of the car...I don\\'t like the stretching back headlight look and the less chrome the better. The tailights are better too. The rear deck looks like it is maybe a little less high than the current one, if so that would be good.I don\\'t care for the Malibu-ish chunk of chrome on the trunk lid or the chromey fog lights.  I apologize if I may have sounded offensive in my last post, that wasn\\'t my intent. I was just asking if it was so bad for Mazda to take a play from Honda\\'s playbook. As long as it\\'s just marketing, and not the vehicles themselves...   I didn\\'t mean to sound offended, I just realized it wasn\\'t clear when I read my original post. I kind of go back and forth on it, it seems like all the OEMs do that. The Jetta used to be a fun funky compact car and now its big and eh, not as exciting as the previous generations. I used to think the 99 to 05(?) Jettas were cool with the 1.8t, now not as much. The early 90s Accord felt very athletic and was fun to drive, the current one, not as much. That doesn\\'t mean all is lost, it is cyclical, especially with certain OEMs. The 80s Jetta was cool at the time, the early \\'00 Jetta was cool, but the 90s was not kind to VW. The early 90s Mazda 626 was cool, the next (mid 90s to early 00s)model lost its edge, and then they came back with the Mazda6.I think Car and Drive does a hits and misses issue every so often, I think they pick up on this cycle.  There are some older drivers (like me for instance) who don\\'t mind some sportiness (good handling, sleek styling) along with refinement in a mid-sized car. No reason mid-sized cars need to be merely a transportation appliance.Couldn\\'t agree with you more! Driving doesn\\'t have to be a chore... to me it\\'s one of the few times during my workdays where I can have moments of exhilaration even when driving within the limits of the law. Of course I love the fact that I can run up to Home Depot and fit some items into my Mazda6 hatchback that would never fit in a sedan and be able to drive home gently without breaking anything. I do think zoom-zoom has done a lot to get Mazda more recognized, and it does sum up their core philosophy well. It is after all, one of the most recognized phrases that\\'s associated with a brand and Mazda would be foolish to abandon it. But the Mazda6 is so much more than zoomx2; it would sell much better imo if they would emphasize its practical side more along with it\\'s innovative features (ie: hatchback w/ spring loaded rear seats, v-6 w/ mtx, speed adjusted volume for the radio). Midsize buyers want more than just fluff and fun emotions or else they\\'d be buying a sports car or a compact. I\\'m sure there\\'s a way for Mazda to mix fun and zoomx2 w/ something more practical and useful.  was the meager V6 powerplant. I just didn\\'t get how a midsize car with a weaker V6 was zoom zoom?   here we go again... this will be the third discussion about the duratec 3.0 that has been in this thread lol.zoomx2 is much more than straight line speed (though the Mazda6 v-6 w/ a mtx has been tested to do 0-60 in the mid 6\\'s). It\\'s about balance, responsiveness, and handling. It\\'s about being able to go around corners with confidence and a car that grips the road \"tenaciously\" as some car reviewers have put it. It\\'s about having among the best brakes in this segment which allows for late braking into corners or avoiding bad drivers. But most of all, zoom-zoom is about having a bigger smile getting out of your car than when you got in it. and fyi...there\\'s only been one generation of the mazda6 and it is current.  626/6 same thing..... :P Anyway, wouldn\\'t the zoomzoom be a bigger ZOOM if the 3.0 were taken out and the turbocharged 2.3 from the speed3 were put in? You\\'d get more horsepower and torque, and you\\'d lighten the car, especially on the front end. Sounds like a win-win ZOOM ZOOM scenario to me!I absolutely agree that the fun in driving a car does come from taking the twisties faster, and being able to, and being able to w/o stressing the car too much. The confidence you feel when you drive and are planted and railed to the road. However, all of this, should come with a powerful motor, so you can accelerate quickly out of those sharp corners, or have some fun in a straight line too. 200HP + 200lb/ft of torque works quite well for this if you can keep it at 3,300 lbs or under. The A3 is the perfect example and Audi\\'s best brain child to date. However, the A3\\'s 200 horses feel like 230 or so, and the 207 lb/ft of torque comes on at 1800 RPM, I don\\'t even have to look up the 3.0 Duratec stats to know it doesn\\'t match those figures at that low in the RPM scale. All this, and a 2.0 is a lot lighter and better balanced setup than a big hulking 3.0 V6. Come on..... admit it.... you\\'d exchange that Duratec for the 3.0 Honda V6 244 HP master engine in a heartbeat if you could. If you gotta go up to a 3.0 V6, you gotta go 240 HP +.  Anyway, wouldn\\'t the zoomzoom be a bigger ZOOM if the 3.0 were taken out and the turbocharged 2.3 from the speed3 were put in? You\\'d get more horsepower and torque, and you\\'d lighten the car, especially on the front end. Sounds like a win-win ZOOM ZOOM scenario to me!Wow, that is totally a great idea. Just in case you were hanging out under a rock for the last 2 years...MazdaSpeed6  However, the A3\\'s 200 horses feel like 230 or so, and the 207 lb/ft of torque comes on at 1800 RPM, I don\\'t even have to look up the 3.0 Duratec stats to know it doesn\\'t match those figures at that low in the RPM scale.If you look at the Cadillac CTS, you see a very similar pattern. Loads of low-end torque thanks to the VVT engine. It never bogs down or had throttle-lag as a result. The GM 3.6 is a fantastic engine. Now if they could only manage to make a 2.0L version of it and strap a supercharger on it...  Now if they could only manage to make a 2.0L version of it and strap a supercharger on it...Like This?  HHhahahahah, I realized the MazdaSpeed6 is similar... to what I described, but not exactly.The engine is different, in that it is tuned for more horsepower and such. The speed3 and speed6 do not have identical powertrains. Also, the MazdaSpeed6 has a whole lot more than just a better engine than the regular 6. Therefore it\\'s not in the same ballpark cost wise either. I\\'m saying just make an even steven trade of engines.... w/o beefing up the brakes, suspension ect.  You guys do realize that these \"New Fusion\" pics are nothing more than doctored 2008 Saab 9-3 pics right?Look at the rims on this Fusion and then go over the GMinsidenews.com and look at the 08 Saab 9-3.Exact same rims...fromt he exact same angles.  What difference does it make even if it were true?  That new Ecotec is nice, but it\\'s not VVT. What they need is a VVT version of it that\\'s geared for low-end torque. Edit: Better yet, VVT and direct injection, plus those electronic valves(no cams anymore!). All three together would net you about 250HP near as I can figure, while getting 35mpg highway.  If you don\\'t get \"zoom zoom\", you don\\'t get it. Oh, I get the \"car\". I like the Mazda6. It looks great, and I\\'m sure I would enjoy driving one. I just don\\'t get the \"Zoom-Zoom\" ads. The little kid saying Zoom-Zoom gives me visions of my son playing with his toy cars when he was 5. The ads are immature, in my opinion. They should have people in their ads who actually have a driver\\'s license. :confuse:  Come on..... admit it.... you\\'d exchange that Duratec for the 3.0 Honda V6 244 HP master engine in a heartbeat if you could. If you gotta go up to a 3.0 V6, you gotta go 240 HP +.But I wouldn\\'t take the Honda engine if I had to deal with their suspension, steering, and especially their weak brakes. Do I think the Mazda6 would be better with a more powerful engine? Yeah, the Mazdaspeed6 is an amazing car that I\\'d love to have. And even though it weighs a couple hundred pounds more, it still handles amazing. One more thing...what would an extra 30 HP do for this car anyway? Well, a cold air intake adds about 15 wheel HP to the 6, and maybe shaves 2 tenths off the 0-60 times if I remember correctly. Not a big deal.But after driving that car for around curvy roads I know well, I didn\\'t feel bad about getting back into my car. For one, my car is paid for. But more importantly, I really like my car. I like how it looks, love the way it drives, I\\'m still amazed at how much stuff I can put in the back of a hatchback. And it is plenty fast. The duratec, though not the best or most powerful in this class, is still really good; it\\'s smooth, sounds great when revved up and it loves to rev. And keeping the rpm\\'s up above 2.7k rpm where it starts to pull pretty well is easy to do if you want to keep the car motivated. One thing I like about the duratec more than legacy GT or MS6 motors is that the power comes on in more of a linear way that is more predictable which is especially valuable in traffic. Now I love honda. I\\'ve had great experiences with their cars and power equipment for many years, and I follow what Honda does closely (from solar panels, to the innovative way they save $ on cooling their factory in summer, their jet plane, new diesel, their robot, F1 racing, CART and IRL etc etc) because I respect and admire much of what they do. But at this point in time with the choices that are available today, I would get a Mazda6 for the same amount of money as an Accord in a heartbeat. To me it looks better, drives better, holds more, is just as safe, and has more personality.  Well for one, the car probably won\\'t even look like that. THat\\'s enough difference for me.  \"and has more personality. \"And is smaller as well. Which may matter for some folks.  hi, I wanted to know what exactly is TMV price, does it includes all taxes,is it final out of the door price, and what exactly is regional adjustment, when they ask zip code  Much improved, the hideous clear tails are finally gone. A bit too much chrome bling though IMO... but I can see the design styling language they\\'re building on for US based Fords.I hope they\\'re not thinking of reusing the current 3.0 either.  according to those who have seen the real thing this is pretty close.By \"the real thing\" do you mean a model or is there a one-off of the 2009? Please elaborate.  andres3: \"Come on..... admit it.... you\\'d exchange that Duratec for the 3.0 Honda V6 244 HP master engine in a heartbeat if you could.

In fact today after a ligth rain, it surprised me by sliding the back end wide at a pretty low speed, maybe 10-15 mph. That may have been the Turanzas (tires) but still. However, I certainly wouldn\\'t pick on the steering feel or the brakes in the Accord.  Off topic, but... we may bring a new Ford into the Family. My wife has her heart set on this exact car...See more Car Pictures at CarSpace.comSee more Car Pictures at CarSpace.com  Don\\'t get me wrong... I don\\'t think the steering and handling of the Accord is bad. In fact I think it\\'s among the best in this segment. But for the way I like to drive, I think the mazda6 has less body lean than the accord and the steering feel seems to be a bit more direct and has a bit more feel. But the brakes on the Accord are a bit soft, one criticism that I also have for the Legacy. I\\'ve seen in several comparo\\'s where the Accord had among the highest brake distances from 60-0. Having a Legacy in the past with not so stellar brakes, it\\'s easy to compensate by giving enough distance to the car in front, but you never know when that 15 feet might make a difference. The Accord was on my short list of cars I was going to buy... but after doing the research to see what the percentage difference in reliability between the Mazda6 and the Accord and it being just a couple percent difference over a five year period, I came to the conclusion that I\\'d rather have the more responsive car that could haul more (I had owned an Accord hatchback and a Legacy wagon previously and found it really handy to have that big of an opening in the back to put bigger things in there). So bottom line, the Accord is a great value and an awesome car...but for me the Mazda6 got my pick.  It is hard to beat a mustang. a co-worker of mine just bought a cannary yellow one, and just a couple days ago somebody I knew was showing me their shelby. got to be fun driving those things.   do you mean a model or is there a one-off of the 2009?Ford showed employees the \"showroom of tomorrow\" where they saw the 09 Fusion (not sure if it was a real design prototype or a drawing) among other new vehicles.

One of those people said this rendering is very very close.OIC. Thanks for the additional information, Allen. It will be interesting to see the final product when the time comes. It will be equally interesting to see if FoMoCo is willing to make the necessary commitment required to stay competitive in the mid-size sedan segment again, a market it once dominated with the Taurus.Ford, and the Fusion, are the underdogs now as the Camry and Accord are the bosses. The big boys on the block. I could be wrong but I believe the Malibu also outsells the Fusion, though I can\\'t fathom why. Anybody know for sure?  And even though the Fusion is discounted...maybe the \\'Bu is cheaper still.  TMV, true market value is a value added service by edmunds. I cannot tell you how they arrive at their price, but it does not include taxes. It is a fair market value price for a vehicle with a specific set of options in a particular region. It gives one a ballpark number in the negotiation process. Taxes, title, finance charges etc are all added by the dealer and not included in TMV.  You might want to look up the specs on the AJ version of the 3.0 Duratec. Has a nice fat mesa shaped torque curve with an advertised 227 - 236 HP on tap. Feels stronger than that.Regards:OldCEM  from: http://www.edmunds.com/products/tmv/about_new.htmlHowever, please note that the TMV prices do not take into account the following items:Manufacturer-to-consumer rebates Tax or Title License/Registration Fees There is more info on TMV at that link and elsewhere on edmunds.com  All of you so hot for the fusion - ford is rebadging it as the new taurus.Dismal mpg and poor build quality so why bother with a fusion?  >TMV, true market value is a value added service by edmunds.

All of you so hot for the fusion - ford is rebadging it as the new taurus.Dismal mpg and poor build quality so why bother with a fusion?Generally speaking, when making semi-inflammatory remarks, unless you are a politician its moderately important to make sure they are correct.The Ford 500 is becoming the new Taurus. The Fusion is staying the Fusion and current discussion is about the \\'09 update. The 500 is considered a \"large car\" so isn\\'t the subject of this forum.

Welcome to Carspace and I would work on finding out the appropriate forums for posting about particular vehicles, and making sure my facts were straight before posting.  Does it include the extra fees some dealers try to add on after the final price? What about fluff and stuff like waxes, mudflaps, strips, 3M protectant sprayed on seats. I\\'m sure it doesn\\'t include these add-ons. Some dealers will add these, and some will not. If the dealer tries to charge you for something you don\\'t want, tell them you refuse to pay for it. These add-ons are typically overpriced.  \"Welcome to Carspace and I would work on finding out the appropriate forums for posting about particular vehicles, and making sure my facts were straight before posting.\"If you look at his bio he certainly has enough late model cars under his belt to make an opinion about the Fusion. He was incorrectd on the rebadge, but gave an opinion on the Fusion.  Generally speaking, when making semi-inflammatory remarks, unless you are a politician, its moderately important to make sure they are correct.Keen observation.  If you look at his bio he certainly has enough late model cars under his belt to make an opinion about the Fusion. He was incorrectd on the rebadge, but gave an opinion on the Fusion.Actually it only looks like he has ever had Toyotas (and mostly SUVs), and most of his other posts in forums were refuting the complaints others had about Toyotas.  When I\\'ve look at TMV for Hyundais, it HAS included manufacturer to consumer rebates available to all, but didn\\'t include special qualifying rebates such as owner loyalty.  Ford showed employees the \"showroom of tomorrow\" where they saw the 09 Fusion (not sure if it was a real design prototype or a drawing) among other new vehicles. One of those people said this rendering is very very close. I did a little more reasearch on that Fusion rendering and found the same think you did akirby. Adding to that though I found out that the interior will be refreshened as well and that radio \"brick\" is apparently going bye bye. If you look at the center stack of the new Escape or that of the Flex that might give you an idea of which way Ford is going with their interiors. Definitely an improvement but not the greatest IMO.Engine choices will supposedly be the PIP Duratec30 I mentioned a month or two ago which is supposed to have 244 HP and get \"considerably better gas mileage than the new D35\", which gets better mileage than the current D30 already, according to the source from Ford. Choice #2 will be a new 2.5L I4 making 190 HP, and again, \"making considerably better mileage...\". Choice 3, and these next two are what I\\'ve heard little about elsewhere, a 260+ HP DI 2.5L Turbo I4 which should get better fuel econ than the V6. Choice 4: a full hybrid, call it Ford\\'s gen II hybrid system if you will. Different from the current Escape\\'s gen I system.The Escape will supposedly get Choices 1, 2, and 4 in \\'09 as well FWIW.Pretty interesting I think. Especially the turbo I4 if that is in fact true. I don\\'t see why not though. :confuse:  I wouldn\\'t pick on the Accord\\'s very nice suspension and steering feel. I would pick on the weak brakes. If there is a weakness it is the brakes. Also, the fact they don\\'t offer a Hatchback at Honda Anymore! :mad: Well, not counting SUBcompacts.  And with that, let\\'s get off the subject of which members are or are not qualified to speak about which vehicles. Thank you.  Wow, those engine choices are pretty exciting. Suppose these will also be the engines for the redesigned Mazda6, maybe the 2.5L Turbo being a revised version of the current MazdaSpeed 2.3L?I\\'d like to see these changes actually implemented in 2009. I\\'ve always wondered if Ford would leave the Fusion as-is for far too long, letting it fall further and further behind as the competition improves. Assuming they keep pricing the same, the new sheet metal and engines should be enough for the car to gain some more sales momentum in 2009.  I\\'ve always wondered if Ford would leave the Fusion as-is for far too long, letting it fall further and further behind as the competition improves.I think it was last year or the year before that they vowed to \"refresh\" every model each year or two with total re-designs every 5 or 6 years. Probably to keep in line with the competition I\\'d guess.No official confirmation has been made on the next Mazda6 engine yet but it has been confirmed to debut at Frankfurt this year. Most of the info I\\'ve gathered lists the NA 2.5L I4 and a Mazda exclusive version of the Duratec35 as the engine choices. The other engine that popped up, rumor as of now, was not the DI turbo 2.5L but rather a DI Duratec37 making 300 HP. MAZDASPEED maybe? :surprise: It will be interesting to see what they do as I think the 3.7L was confirmed for the CX-9 already.Wow, those engine choices are pretty exciting.The V6, which is the big seller in the Fusion right now, is probably the least exciting but it is still pretty good news. Especially if they can and do offer the more fuel efficient, probably in a limited production performance edition of course, turbo DI I4. Maybe SVT will rise again soon. :shades:  that does sound like a promising develpment. but I wonder why they would have a 244hp and 260hp options...they seem a bit too close together power wise. perhaps the turbo would have more torque at lower rpms than the v-6 (minus the lag of course)? or maybe they just want to take the Mazdaspeed6 powertrain and drop it in the fusion?  I\\'m not sure either. Seems to me the 2.5L turbo would have more than 260 HP though. Probably closer to 280 IMO. They could put that on AWD models, stiffen the chassis and suspension and call it an SVT very easily. Then sell it for $28k-$30k and make every Accord and Camry V6 stare at it\\'s tail lights. :P  That would be fun, but it would change the sales dynamics of the CamCords? Honda could also dumb down the TSX, put SHAWD in it and have a superbly riding sedan that\\'s better the Mazda.  Honda could also dumb down the TSX, put SHAWD in it and have a superbly riding sedan that\\'s better the Mazda.Don\\'t you mean the TL? The TSX is going to be in a league of it\\'s own now that the 6 and the Altima are larger. Plus the TSX is the Euro Accord while the TL is the U.S. Accord IIRC. No?And what makes you think a dumbed down version of the TSX would be better than the future 6 when the current TSX isn\\'t even better than the current 6? If you go by price and features then you\\'re stepping into MAZDASPEED6 territory and there\\'s simply no contest between that and the TSX.  \"If you go by price and features then you\\'re stepping into MAZDASPEED6 territory and there\\'s simply no contest between that and the TSX.\"Disagree on one hand, agree on the other. Both could be in this segment with different emphasis. Although I believe it\\'s a moot point, as I don\\'t think Honda would do it. However, should they do it, they have the cache to sell a lot of cars.  I gotta say though, now that Honda has started to introduce cars with turbo\\'s, it will be interesting to see what they do in the next few years. I\\'m thinking though, for the immediate future, turbo\\'s will be an Acura thing with maybe one for an s2k replacement. As for the Accord, I doubt Honda will want to go for the fringe \"sporty\" market with the mainstream sedans. I could see a coupe that gets an \"s\" type treatment though with a firmer suspension, 6 spd manual, extra power, and maybe even SHawd or mugen treatments. That\\'s what I\\'m hoping for actually... that could be an amazing car. The great thing with this step is that it could attract a whole new customer group (sport oriented) without alienating its core customer while adding some charisma to the Honda name, much like the Civic SI has done. But in the end, I think Honda would be concerned about poaching sales away from Acura, so I\\'m not holding my breath. Mazda, on the other hand, has shown it wants to own the fun-to-drive-without-bmw-payments segment and not worry about competition with sister companies. But I think their concern is that the 6 does not go to far out there where it\\'s appeal is too limited and result in huge discounts like there are now. Really, I think all that Mazda needs to do for a successful new generation of the 6 is to make it a little larger and give it a bit more sound dampening at highway speeds while retaining fun to drive character. And more power as is being speculated would be :shades: :shades: :shades:  Although I believe it\\'s a moot point, as I don\\'t think Honda would do it. However, should they do it, they have the cache to sell a lot of cars.Agreed. The more the better I say. :shades: Keeps the other mfrs on their toes too.  But I think their concern is that the 6 does not go to far out there where it\\'s appeal is too limited and result in huge discounts like there are now.Well the lack of an ATX hurt the MPS6 in that regard as we all know. Still, it was a great effort by Mazda and I just hope they have the guts to try again with the next gen.  What\\'s SHAWD?  Honda/Acura\\'s Super Handling All Wheel Drive.The beauty of this system is that it doesn\\'t only transfer power between front and back but also left and right. Thus gives the vehicle better cornering ability.  SHAWD \"Super Handling\" All wheel drive  More Power!1998 626 V6- 170hp, 2990lbs, 17.5lbs/hp2006 Mazda6 s- 220hp, 3320 lbs, 15 lbs/hp2009 Mazda6 s- 260?hp, 3550?lbs, 13.5 lbs/hp  Honda/Acura\\'s Super Handling All Wheel Drive. The beauty of this system is that it doesn\\'t only transfer power between front and back but also left and right. Thus gives the vehicle better cornering ability. As I understand it, the system actually slows the inside rear wheel and accelerates the outside rear wheel to push the nose of the car into the corner even harder.  yes, unlike the usual application and operation of a \\'stability control\\' system, the Honda system actually improves handling.  The 6s limitations in my mind all have to do with those Ford imposed restrictions under the hoods. What exactly are these \"restrictions\"? Consider that the 2.3L 4-cyl is a Mazda-designed engine that Ford uses in their products, and NOT vice-versa. As for the V6, Mazda didn\\'t have the capital on their own to develop one from the ground up back in \\'01-\\'02, especially considering that the V6 is only offered in the US and Canada, and not in other markets.  What exactly are these \"restrictions\"? That\\'s something I\\'d like to know too. Without Ford I doubt we\\'d even be talking about a Mazda vehicle right now.Mazda has been given free reign over chassis development as well. The 6, RX-8, CX-9, and CX-7 are unique to them too. Ford has taken their platforms and done their thing with them but Mazda did do all of the ground work. This next 6 is not a re-badged Fusion and from what I\\'ve gathered actually shares more with the Euro Mondeo or vice versa.The 3, Tribute, and Mazda5 were all done jointly (3 and 5 included Volvo too) but I don\\'t think Mazda was restricted in any way during their share of the development. I\\'m also wondering what the \"limitations\" captain2 referred to are as well. The 6s is competitive or class leading in all performance categories. The only \"limitation\" I see is in the back seat which is being addressed.  Electronic Stability Control (ESC) allows ABS systems to automatically brake individual wheels as needed to improve handling and steering control under all driving conditions.http://www.aa1car.com/library/stability_control.htmelectronic stability control has improved the emergency handling on the vehicles we have testedhttp://autos.yahoo.com/consumerreports/article/safety_checks.html  class leading in all performance categoriesyou\\'ve got to be kidding - the lowest HP combined with subpar FE in any of the V6s and not a whole lot better than that with the 4 bangers either? IMO the only thing worse than the DT3.0 are possibly some of those pushrod GMs - a situation that even they seem to be able to address in the XR and 08 Malibu 3.6s.In terms of chassis design and development, Mazda has certainly done a good job with the cars/SUVs you mention - a good thing too - because otherwise the Fusionados would have little to talk about. If the Mazda chassis is as good as it is, then it deserves engine(s) every bit its equal.  believe the politically correct BS if you wish, but putting the braking to individual wheels while it certainly improves stability and therefore safety CANNOT improve any vehicles ultimate evasive capabilities. You need to add power for that, something that the only Honda SH system does do (currently).  the lowest HP combined with subpar FE in any of the V6s and not a whole lot better than that with the 4 bangers either?I probably should have said track performance categories as it does lose out a bit on FE, NVH levels, and interior volume. However, when it came out it\\'s track performance was bested by none. The only one I\\'m not quite sure of is the 0-60 because it was clocked at 6.5 seconds but the Accord may have been a tenth or two faster. Now it\\'s a bit slower than two or three other sedans, but that will most likely be addressed with the next one. You keep harping on the Duratec30 like it\\'s some dinosaur. It might be in some other applications but in the 6 it is pretty advanced and smooth. Have you ever driven a Mazda6 V6?  Right, true handling improvement means the vehicle is able to go around a corner faster, something that is hard to do with ESC applying brakes. As you said, adding power (in the right amount and to the right contact patch) is a good way to do that.Obviously, we are talking about professional driving. A wannabe (like me) would probably go around a corner faster with ESC than without, due to lack of experience in reaching the absolute limit of handling capabilities without losing control. This is assuming that the ESC is minimally invasive, meaning it allows some fun and only steps in when really needed.  Have you ever driven a Mazda6 V6?I know that was directed at captain but you have been making me even more curious about driving a Mazda6 V6. I remarked earlier that after driving the Fusion V6 6A, I beleived the main reason it felt quick was more because of the 6-speed Aisin transmission, and not because of the motor. I\\'d like to see myself what the Mazda treatment does for the DT.I\\'m determined to drive a Mazda6 V6 manual, but I think the local Mazda dealer knows me after having driven a Miata and a Mazdaspeed6 and not buying, and they now seem reluctant to give me any attention. I can\\'t say I blame them  Maybe we can go under the pretense of it being for my wife?   I remarked earlier that after driving the Fusion V6 6A, I believed the main reason it felt quick was more because of the 6-speed Aisin transmission, and not because of the motor. I\\'d like to see myself what the Mazda treatment does for the DT.Having owned my 6 V6 for close to three years, and test-drove both the Fusion and Milan a few times, I can tell you from experience that they\\'re two different beasts. The 6-speed auto is a very good transmission, no doubt about that, but the DT comes alive for me when I drive it with the 5-speed manual. I\\'ll bet it\\'s partly from the VVT programming that\\'s unique to Mazda, and partly from the manual, but the DT is nothing to sneeze at under the hood of the 6. I\\'m determined to drive a Mazda6 V6 manual, but I think the local Mazda dealer knows me after having driven a Miata and a Mazdaspeed6 and not buying, and they now seem reluctant to give me any attention. I can\\'t say I blame them Maybe we can go under the pretense of it being for my wife?It\\'s worked for me. Actually, my local Mazda dealer has been very generous (and patient ) with me in terms of test-drives, but that\\'s probably because I bought my 6 from them.   believe the politically correct BS if you wishOkay, I will.  I\\'d like to see myself what the Mazda treatment does for the DT. All I can tell you is that after owning an Escape and a Mazda6, both with the DT30, the version in the 6 was way smoother and quieter. There was noise but it was from the exhaust which was given a sport tune to sound throatier. I liked that sound but others could be put off by it. I have also driven my father\\'s old \\'96 Sable and his current \\'06 Zephyr. The Sable\\'s DT30 was a bit rough by today\\'s standards but the Zephyr wasn\\'t all that bad. Better sound insulation might have helped the latter. I\\'d have to say the DT30 in the 6 is still the smoothest of them all though. And it had almost no sound insulation IMO.Keep in mind that I can\\'t hear myself think in my Mustang when accelerating. Just so you have an idea of my sound tolerance. Maybe we can go under the pretense of it being for my wife? Or you can wear a fake mustache. :shades:  nope only the Fusion and also the Five Hundred, both applications in which the DT is subpar or even a joke (in the case of the 3600 lb. 500) IMO, and sure, put a MTX on a car that 90% of buyers in this class want ATs and I would guess you might be able to pull 6.5s in a 6. Remember though that it is not only the acceleration numbers I\\'m talking about, but also how it sounds and feels doing it. And yes I owned several of those older Mazda/Ford products I referenced (an RX2, an 808, a Probe (a Mazda design originally intended to be a Mustang), and a GLC) and thought they were among the most underrated vehicles of that time - but then again, that was largely before the Ford infection hit the engine compartments. Put the Honda V6, the Nissan VQ, the Toyota 2GR, the GM 3.6, or the Kia/Hyundia 3.3s in a 6 (or a Fusion) then you would really have something IMO. Or you could let Mazda have its way with blown 4s, premium gas, and likely more suspect durability, the net result also a big improvement.   Remember though that it is not only the acceleration numbers I\\'m talking about, but also how it sounds and feels doing it. That\\'s not how everyone feels though. I never really paid attention to the sound all that much until we began discussing it.and sure, put a MTX on a car that 90% of buyers in this class want ATs and I would guess you might be able to pull 6.5s in a 6.In all fairness though, the MTX has been a popular choice in the 6s since it was introduced. It\\'s the one sedan in this class where the MTX still sells well. Mazda lots were filled with ATX equipped copies in it\\'s first year of sales because Mazda highly underestimated the demand for the MTX. I actually had to wait until the \\'04 model came out to get an MTX.Did you have a V6 in that Probe? I ask because that was the DT25 which eventually became the DT30.  Electronic Stability Control (ESC) allows ABS systems to automatically brake individual wheels as needed to improve handling and steering control under all driving conditions. I think the definition of \"improved handling\" is needed here, as this will lower the overall limits of the vehicle, although I concur that it may help steering control (by slowing the vehicle down). Cutting power will never help you go faster.While electronic stability control has improved the emergency handling on the vehicles we have tested, it\\'s not a cure-all for inherently poor-handling vehicles.Again, it seems to echo improved stability (hence the name) but not an actual increase in handling.While I feel that Stability Control may be helpful for vans, SUVs and other poor handling vehicles, I don\\'t know how much it will help on the average sedan. If it makes someone feel more comfortable, I don\\'t see an issue with it for them, it just slows them down when they get into trouble.Most stock, unmodified, mid-sized mid-market sedans have one good swerve. That is, you can swerve to miss the tire that came off the truck in front of you, or the tent that came off the roof rack, etc, but after that swerve, you are headed for the k-barrier. The next swerve, to re-align the vehicle with traffic, is where things get ugly. I have to reserve judgment on DSC for the masses to see if it makes a difference here or not.  thank you - unlike some others you do seem to understand what these systems do and how they work. I agree that the problem is how invasive these systems are set, \\'minimal\\' invasiveness is less desireable as our driving abililties (reaction times etc) erode. Who do you suppose it is that determines when \\'only steps in when really needed\\' is? When I\\'m 90 and my eysight and reactions are bad, I\\'ll certainly need more \\'help\\' than I do today. And then, of course, you have those folks that mistakenly think that these things improve something (other than safety) and develop bad driving habits - perhaps relying on some computer \\'Nanny\\' to correct their own gross driving misjudgments.  Did you have a V6 in that Probe? I ask because that was the DT25 which eventually became the DT30.I disagree, the 2.5 V6 in the Probe was a Mazda design while the 2.5 V6 in the Contour was a Ford design, and that, from what I understand, became the 3.0.The Probe also had a different manual transmission, IIRC, while the Focus,Contour, Fusion, Mazda3/6 etc all got the MTX75.  no the Probe a Mazda 4 banger and MT and a hoot to drive, I believe the Ford V6 at the time (89) was the old pushrod design that I also had in an Aerostar - talk about bad!  Sorry I was a generation off on the Probe, the 93-96 got the 2.5 V6 that was a Mazda, the 90-92 got a Vulcan V6. The 2.2l Turbo (jokingly rated at like 160hp) was the one to have though, either in the Probe, the Mazda MX6, or the 626.At the time though, the Diamond Star was a hotter ticket for the same bucks, with a 200hp turbo.  You are correct about the Probe\\'s engines. I assumed the 2.5 was the same as was in the Contour. Hey, when you\\'re raking in tens of billions of dollars selling Explorers why use the same engine in more than one vehicle right? :P If only Blacque Jacques had some forethought. :sick:  Isn\\'t the Explorer engine in the Mustang now?I also think the 4.6 modular V8 was related to the duratec family, they just kept loping cylinders or banks off it. Not so uncommon, the original Audi V8 motor was 2 VW GTI motors stuck together.  Isn\\'t the Explorer engine in the Mustang now? Now it is but it wasn\\'t always. The Mustang and Explorer actually share both engines but they are tuned differently for each. I have one of each as a matter of fact. :shades: I also think the 4.6 modular V8 was related to the duratec family, they just kept loping cylinders or banks off it. Not so uncommon, the original Audi V8 motor was 2 VW GTI motors stuck together.Not so sure about the V8 being part of the Duratec family. I\\'ve never heard or read that one before. FWIW, it\\'s not called \"modular\" because it can be morphed into many different engines but rather because of it\\'s manufacturing facilities/processes. The Aston V12 is essentially two Duratec30s fused together though.  I have to reserve judgment on DSC for the masses to see if it makes a difference here or not.That is exactly what DSC does and you cannot. A good DSC system, like BMWs, can apply the brakes to individual wheels, which you as the driver cannot, to keep the car pointed in the direction of the steering wheel. SHAWD cannot help in this situation unless you gun the gas in an emergency situation.A good DSC type system, like BMWs, will also work to prevent you from getting into a bad situation, before you even know you are in one.  A good DSC type system, like BMWs, will also work to prevent you from getting into a bad situation, before you even know you are in one.How does it know? How does it know what I am trying to do? How does it know what other hazards exist? It primarily tries to control fishtailing, so instead of hitting the k-barrier with the back of the car, I hit it head on. This is not helpful to me.People give up when it comes to emergency situations and vehicle control. You don\\'t lose control of a vehicle, you relinquish control of a vehicle. You might not be able to get the car to do exactly what you want (those pesky laws of physics) but you can usually avoid a worst case scenario, which is all the DSC is going to do anyway (excepting unwieldy vehicles with high center of gravity...read- SUVs and church vans).If you wanted to improve handling, put more power to the outside wheel in turns...oh wait, that is what a limited slip differential does. With respect to braking a wheel:If you brake the inside front wheel on a corner, its not going to make a big difference because there is no weight on that wheel. If you have weight on that wheel, then you aren\\'t at a threshold where you need DSC, you just need to learn how to drive. If you brake the inside rear wheel, that is going to me even more unloaded then the front wheel (watch a VW GTI or a Nissan Sentra autocross, that wheel isn\\'t even on the ground). If you brake the outside front wheel, then you are just going to plow or understeer into the direction you were going previously. If you brake the outside rear wheel, you are going to be facing the direction you were previously coming from.  You have a seriously simplistic view of how a vehicle handles in a turn. Stability control detects both understeer and oversteer using a yaw sensor and a steering wheel sensor and corrects for both by braking different wheels. It knows where you\\'re trying to go versus where you\\'re actually going. It also cuts power if necessary.Limited slip differentials do NOT send MORE power to the outside wheels. It just prevents all the torque from going to a wheel that is slipping (thus the name).And the braking that is done by ESC does not cause you to lose control - it doesn\\'t lock up the wheel. IF you\\'re understeering and you brake the inside rear wheel a little it helps the car to rotate into the turn (try dragging one foot on a bike).   Stability control detects both understeer and oversteer using a yaw sensor and a steering wheel sensor and corrects for both by braking different wheels.I would argue that my butt accomplishes the same task, my instructor used to refer to it as \"butt pucker\" Limited slip differentials do NOT send MORE power to the outside wheels. It just prevents all the torque from going to a wheel that is slipping (thus the name).Limited slips prevent all the power going to the wheel that is slipping by sending the power \"from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip\" (to quote Subaru). So the way this translates to me is when coming off \"off-ramp\" going onto \"I-5\", my Contour would do nothing but spin the inside front wheel. The NX2000 w/limited slip could put down all of its 140hp much sooner as I exited the turn.And the braking that is done by ESC does not cause you to lose control - it doesn\\'t lock up the wheel. IF you\\'re understeering and you brake the inside rear wheel a little it helps the car to rotate into the turn (try dragging one foot on a bike).Eh, in reference to my previous point, you never \"lose\" control, you relinquish it. Also, if that inside rear wheel has enough weight on it for braking to make a difference, then there is more cornering potential in the car and someone needs to turn the wheel more.Having raced mountain bikes, I never \"drag your foot\" in a turn because it slows me down. If I put my foot down, it is for stability (called a \"dab\"), and it means I am not going as fast as I should be, or I took a bad line or some other issue.Trail braking where you drag the brake a little bit past the initial tun-in to the corner to get some rotation is different and seems to work well for bikes and cars alike.Like I said, I think its probably great technology for the masses, especially those who don\\'t understand that having a top heavy vehicle full of kids might handle differently than an Accord. As far as performance driving goes, I would really like to drive the car myself.  a) the drag your foot on a bike comment was an analogy, not a recommendationb) if the front wheels have lost grip and are causing understeer, then no amount of grip or acceleration from the inside rear tire is going to correct that. You have only two options - back off the throttle and let the front wheels regain their grip or brake the inside rear wheel only (you can\\'t do that with the seat of your pants) which will help pull the fronts into the turn.I wasn\\'t arguing that stability control is better for pure performance - it\\'s not. I was just pointing out the technical inaccuracies of your statements.  I don\\'t think ESC can really \"improve\" handling. I think the most it can do, is make handling (at the limits) safer. It can make the driver more confident, so he/she will drive closer to the limit than he/she normally would, thereby improving lap times.I think there was discussion a while back about F1 or Indy cars using Traction Control during races. Many argued that Traction Control negated some of the skill of the driver, and should not be used in race situations (only for testing).  if the front wheels have lost grip and are causing understeer, then no amount of grip or acceleration from the inside rear tire is going to correct that. You have only two options - back off the throttle and let the front wheels regain their grip or brake the inside rear wheel only (you can\\'t do that with the seat of your pants) which will help pull the fronts into the turn.My point was if you are plowing that much, the inside rear wheel is going to be so unloaded that the effect of braking by that wheel is going to be minimal.A third option would be to reduce your steering wheel angle (like when you straighten up to slam on the brakes on a motorcycle, or traverse a slippery spot) and then resume turning again.I think this will be like ABS where it will change the type of crash (and hopefully the severity), but maybe not reduce the overall rate. It just compensates for lack of driver skill by lowering the limits of the vehicle.  I think the most it can do, is make handling (at the limits) safer. ...by lowering them.It can make the driver more confident, so he/she will drive closer to the limit than he/she normally would, thereby improving lap times.Eh, while I think driver confidence is a big issue (I actually set up the NX to be more forgiving at the limit because I was faster that way), I think something that electronically defines the envelope and determines when I am exceeding it would just slow me down.On the road is different than on the track. I personally would still like to be able to read and interpret the feedback my car is providing, with out 2-3 layers of electronics in-between, but for others, I would like them to have as little input on the driving experience as possible :P   I think something that electronically defines the envelope and determines when I am exceeding it would just slow me down. I think no matter how skilled you are at driving, you will go a little faster around that corner knowing if the rear breaks free on you, the car will save you. If Traction Control can improve lap times for F1 drivers, I\\'m sure it can do the same for you.  the inside rear wheel is going to be so unloaded that the effect of braking by that wheel is going to be minimalSorry, but the fact is that it DOES work. The inside rear wheel is NOT totally unloaded. Remember we\\'re talking about a recoverable situation, not trying to do a hairpin at 100 mph. Do you think they faked all the video demonstrations that show that it works this way?This is a SAFETY device. It reacts to a situation more quickly and in ways that no driver can match to keep the car on the road. Period. If you think you can do the same thing under normal driving circumstances you\\'re sadly mistaken. We\\'re talking about an unexpected situation, not hanging it out around the curve on a track day.  I think no matter how skilled you are at driving, you will go a little faster around that corner knowing if the rear breaks free on you, the car will save you.Not when it kicks in so far before the back end is going to break free....This is assuming it kicks in at the limit, but it doesn\\'t, it lowers the limits. Thats fine, I think most people obviously don\\'t know the limits of the vehicle they are driving and I would just as soon not have them try to find those limits driving on the road with me. I don\\'t think they will miss it.  Sorry, but the fact is that it DOES work. The inside rear wheel is NOT totally unloaded. Remember we\\'re talking about a recoverable situation, not trying to do a hairpin at 100 mph. Do you think they faked all the video demonstrations that show that it works this way?So far the only video I have seen is on a test track, some with cones and some with a styrofoam VW that gets pushed out of the way.Will it help the average driver avoid certain types of crashes? Yes. Will it make someone a better driver? Definitely not.This is a SAFETY device. It reacts to a situation more quickly and in ways that no driver can match to keep the car on the road. Period. If you think you can do the same thing under normal driving circumstances you\\'re sadly mistaken.I disagree, but I hope if it makes you feel more comfortable, you will purchase vehicles equipped with this device. I would rather invest some money in actually teaching people (or myself) how to drive, but given my level of faith in mankind at this point, I think the less driving people actually do, the better.  This is assuming it kicks in at the limit, but it doesn\\'t, it lowers the limits.Some will, and some will not (substantially lower the limits). There are systems that can be set closer to the limit than you (or any other driver) can get, on a regular basis.PS: Maybe there should be a separate thread on the ESC issue?  I didn\\'t mean to come across as quite so opinionated about the stability control thing. Like I said before, I will reserve judgment until I get to see it deployed with enough market penetration to make a difference.I think it could be an exciting new technology, and if it makes the roads safer I\\'m all for it. I think it will be a boon to top heavy unwieldy vehicles (vans/suvs) and also heavy tractor trailer trucks.I don\\'t see it as the panacea that its being touted, but maybe it will give way to what is, or will be a step towards autonomous vehicles that form \"trains\" to maximize vehicle through-put and ease congestion.As far as if i am better off with or without it, I have decided I am better off without it but want all of you to have it :P j/k   Some will, and some will not (substantially lower the limits). There are systems that can be set closer to the limit than you (or any other driver) can get, on a regular basis.Oh it better not show up \"on a regular basis\" or its wayyyy to invasive. And if I hit those limits on the street, then eh, I deserve a big spanking.  The only problem I have with ESC is, Does the cost out-weigh the benefit? I do think ESC is a good thing, overall. However, I cannot think of one time, in the past 20 years, when ESC would have been needed (in my case). How many cars would I have to buy, equipped with ESC, before I actually use it? If ever. If you buy cars every 3 years, how much will you end up paying? for something that may never be used. Sounds a lot like insurance.  Can we talk about midsize cars again?PLEASE? I miss that!Un-camoflauged pics of the 2008 Accord have debuted, sketches for the updated Fusion are surfacing, a new Malibu is due soon, and we\\'re talking about stability control programs (not on particular cars even!)I\\'d love to have someone to talk about the new Accord with (in comparison with say, the Altima/Camry/Fusion). Anyone interested?  Just saw the un-camo\\'d pics of the accord, and while I like the coupe a lot, I\\'m quite underwhelmed with the sedan. The character line on the side looks forced, the hood is too horizontal and square in the front, and the front headlight looks like it extends down the side too much like the altima taillights do. Maybe it will look better in person, but it just doesn\\'t seem to have much flow to it. From what I\\'ve seen of the interior, that looks very nice. It\\'ll be interesting what they do to the engine, especially the v-6.  i\\'ll be honest - i don\\'t really like it. i\\'ve seen the concept in person, and both the production coupe and sedan just don\\'t do it justice. being a nissan fan, i was worried when i saw the concept - because it was really sharp. something got lost in the translation i guess. the coupe has more potential to be impressive in person, but its hard to tell the proportions from the picture, and that rear end looks quite...well...plump.my two cents at least!-thene   I don\\'t think ESC can really \"improve\" handling. I think the most it can do, is make handling (at the limits) safer.I guess I would call that improved...   ...the front headlight looks like it extends down the side too much like the altima taillights do.I am not a fan of that look either. I like the headlights to stay pretty much in the front plane of the car. I had thought, back when the concept pictures were out, that the new Accord was going to do that and the front would be somewhat more like the TSX in that regard.   Gotta agree with zzzoom6,Coupe: PrettySedan: Meh...Since there is no direct shot of the front of the sedan but base on the coupe\\'s look, it should be descent. The side looks like Honda has lifted out directly from the 5-series. Not bad looking but it\\'s just not \"Honda\". The rear, again, is the weakest link (that\\'s 2 models in the roll now, let\\'s not make it a trend, Honda!). Looks to me like the old Saturn LS300 (Hint: NOT GOOD) with Altezza lights on it.As for interior, although no clear shot has been leaked but based on several spy photos and Honda\\'s own track record I think it will again be class-leading. Overall, I do like the new one better than the current version, especially the coupe. Also, there is no doubt in my mind that this one will continue to out-handle the Camry, out-smooth the Altima and out-refine every other competitors. However, will it outsell the Camry and regain the number 1 spot is yet to be seen.Source: Edmunds InsideLine  The front has pretty much stayed the same as the concept. The headlights of the Accord Concept had also swept back to the front fender area.  Edmunds Accord PicsI actually like the sedan now, probably still not my first choice regardless of what the new engine will be though, but the coupe leaves a lot to be desired for me. Looks too much like a Civic or Scion tC IMO. Both are OK to me but I\\'d like something different for a change. The Altima coupe is still the my choice in that dept.I\\'d buy one if the price is right. But I\\'m betting the new Mazda6 will be better for me in several ways including price.  \"How does it know? How does it know what I am trying to do?\"It\\'s okay if you doubt the technology, unless you have your bacon saved by one of these systems, you don\\'t know what you don\\'t know.  \"I would argue that my butt accomplishes the same task, my instructor used to refer to it as \"butt pucker\" \"Seriously if you have read any of the posts, you would have gathered a DSC type system can apply the brakes to wheels individually to keep the car pointed in the same direction as the steering wheel. Something you cannot do.You are going in the wrong direction here. In an emergency situation this technology will drive better than you. Believe it or not.   I\\'ll agree with the coupe looking much better than the sedan, although IMO the front ends, as well as the rear of the sedan, are trying to mimic the Camry (not good). Also, can someone PLEASE tell me the point to sweeping the head- and tail lights up and out over the fenders (ie. the \\'07 Altima and now the \\'08 Accord?) It\\'s a trend that\\'s tacky and pointless at best.  A mixed bag of everything, Nissan, Ford, Hyundai, Saturn, Toyota, Audi, BMW...and thus, it will sell like mad   Also, can someone PLEASE tell me the point to sweeping the head- and tail lights up and out over the fenders (ie. the \\'07 Altima and now the \\'08 Accord?)I believe it\\'s to give you the illusion that the car is moving when sitting still. Or that it goes so fast that the front end is being formed by the air it\\'s moving through.  From a French magazine. I haven\\'t seen this here before so forgive me if this has already gone around this thread.  The front has pretty much stayed the same as the concept. The headlights of the Accord Concept had also swept back to the front fender area. I may have only seen it from a straight on front view and not seen the swept-backness as a result.Another thing, and this looks like it may apply to the new Mazda6 as well, what is with practically eliminating the rear deck? The Accord coupe looks like it should be a hatchback as does that picture of the new Mazda6 and the Altima seems to be about there, too. Nothing wrong with hatchbacks but putting a trunk on and then leaving no room for a lid does not make sense to me.When my wife was looking for a car we checked out a Volvo S40 and that trunk lid was so small that it was to the point where you could pretty much only slide things in horizontally. Looks like some of the midsizes are getting to that point now.  Looks good.If the next Mazda6 really looks like that then it\\'ll be the looker among the midsizers. Drop the DT35 in it and call it a day.  Drop the DT35 in it and call it a day.That is the current projection but rumors are flying around the Mazda and Ford forums that it will get a 280 HP/265 ft-lbs Duratec37 like the 2008 CX-9. Linclolns will be getting the DI version of that motor with 300+ HP. But the DT35 wouldn\\'t be bad either.I\\'m curious to know if AWD will be an option on the next 6 without having to step up to the MPS if it ever gets built again.  Call me an old fuddy duddy but I think the 2007 Accord is a better-looking vehicle than the 2008, which bears quite a bit of resemblance to the Altima, which is ugly, in my humble opinion. The 2006-08 Fusions look better than both.Yup, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. But it seems, from the photos, that Honda is mimicking other manufacturers rather than setting the pace, when it comes to design.Oh sure, Honda will sell a ton of them, just because they are Hondas, cars with rock-solid reputations. That\\'s a good thing for Honda, bad news for competitors.  The new Accord will sell NOT because on great reputations and the Honda name.If the 08\\' continues Accord\\'s track record throughout the last decade or so it\\'ll continue to be the best all-around (i.e. handling, comfort, powertrain refinement, interior build quality, ergonomics) midsizer on the market.That, my friend, is why Honda sold tons of them and will continue to do so. Reputation can only last a period of time, sooner or later the consumers will catch on. Best example of that is the Taurus.  rumors are flying around the Mazda and Ford forums this has seemed to be a big problem with Ford lately - what is promised, projected, or otherwise hinted either never happens or is so late in happening that the rest of the competition has long since surpassed whatever actually happens. The Fusion, for example, is also \\'hinted\\' to be getting an \\'improved\\' 3.0 at a whole 240hp and Ford is supposed to be refitting some engine plants to do it. Anticipated for 09 or 10 model year - even if it is a great engine, it will still be several years late relative to what Honda, Nissan, and Toyota already have, and still be a bunch of HP short. The 6, if Ford can get enough production capacity for simply that lower production vehicle, may be more of a possibility for the now available 3.5 which does strike me as being at least, in the same zip code as some of the \\'Japanese\\' engines and, of course the GM 3.6.There does, however, seem to be a history of a lot of unkept promises and/or late arrivals for those of you waiting on Ford to do anything.  new spec\\'s for the powertrain HP, torque, and fuel efficiency ratings.  this has seemed to be a big problem with Ford lately - what is promised, projected, or otherwise hinted either never happens or is so late in happening that the rest of the competition has long since surpassed whatever actually happens.I reported most of what you posted about regarding the engines. I can say that the vast majority of the rumors I\\'ve been reading are coming from engine plant employees or actual Ford employees who are keeping their names a secret for good reason. That doesn\\'t make any of it true of course, but it seems that these people are actually working on the products they are speaking of currently which is better than some of the rumors of the past which came from magazine writer\\'s guesses and over anxious execs at big car shows.  I\\'m curious to know if AWD will be an option on the next 6 without having to step up to the MPS if it ever gets built again.AWD is still speculated, as well as a 6-speed manual for both the 4-cyl and V6.As for the V6, the 3.7L from the \\'08 CX-9 is the front-runner for the 6, since it\\'s already being worked over extensively by Mazda.A 270+HP 3.7L with 6-speed manual and AWD? Where do I sign up?   As for the V6, the 3.7L from the \\'08 CX-9 is the front-runner for the 6, since it\\'s already being worked over extensively by Mazda.I think the motors are built here and sent to Japan to be worked on by Mazda IIRC. Since the 6 is built here that might not make sense. However, the Mustang is supposed to get the DT37 for MY2009 and it is built along side of the 6. That makes a good case for it too I\\'d say. :shades:  The new Accord will sell NOT because on great reputations and the Honda name.That may not be the only reason for the new Honda\\'s success but it certainly does not hurt matters. It is an asset rather than a liability. A very significant one in the grand scheme of things.Ford certainly squandered its Taurus bonanza by letting the car die on the vine but we still bought a 2007 Fusion, partially owing to good experiences (mostly) with Ford products. Hopefully, Ford will not repeat the mistakes it made with the Taurus but none of us can predict the future or all of us would be millionaires.While I certainly agree that the Accord is a fine mid-size automobile, it was also priced out of our range when we purchased a MSRP $27,105 V6 SEL AWD Fusion.If the 08\\' continues Accord\\'s track record throughout the last decade or so it\\'ll continue to be the best all-around (i.e. handling, comfort, powertrain refinement, interior build quality, ergonomics) midsizer on the market.That\\'s a glowing testimonial, to be sure, but it\\'s also how we feel about our Fusion. The 3.0-liter Duratec V6 may not be state-of-the-art but coupled to a six-speed automatic it is competitive in all areas and a very durable, proven engine that suits us just fine (except for poor in-city, stop-\\'n-go gasoline mileage, 14.8 mpg).We can agree on one thing: The 2008 Accord will outsell the 2008 Fusion by a large margin. McDonald\\'s will sell more hamburger\\'s than Wendy\\'s, too.I seriously doubt if Ford, GM or Chrysler will ever achieve the sales levels of the Camry or Accord in the mid-size market but that does not mean that their offerings are not competitive with what Toyota and Honda put forth.The buying public now perceives the Camry and Accord to be better products and that perception becomes reality in terms of sales. (McDonald\\'s versus Wendy\\'s.)I still say the 2007 Accord looks better than its successor but it\\'s unlikely that my personal observation will have any effect on Honda sales at all, even if tens of thousands of people agree with me, which is not likely either.In short, Honda probably has another \"hit\" on its hands and that is just fine, too.  \"While I certainly agree that the Accord is a fine mid-size automobile, it was also priced out of our range when we purchased a MSRP $27,105 V6 SEL AWD Fusion.\"You would have to look pretty hard to find an Accord that cost that much with EX-L models going for about 22k. My concerns about the 08 Accord are its apparent added size and weight. I think the fuel economy will suffer (it will have a more efficient engine, but the weight will keep mpg about the same, or possible slightly higher highway and slightly lower city). I also think acceleration will be about the same despite more hp. Now if they can keep the weight the same, that is a different story, but I don\\'t think it will happen.I also don\\'t like the looks of the headroom in the rear seat. Camry lost its good rear seat headroom with their latest, and it looks like Accord is headed (not a pun) down the same path.  Seriously if you have read any of the posts, you would have gathered a DSC type system can apply the brakes to wheels individually to keep the car pointed in the same direction as the steering wheel. Something you cannot do.While I agree that braking an individual wheel is something I cannot do, the wheels on the inside of the turn aren\\'t going to do very much even if the brakes are applied, and if they are then someone didn\\'t turn the wheel as hard as they should\\'ve in the first place, so its correction for driver error.You are going in the wrong direction here. In an emergency situation this technology will drive better than you. Believe it or not.Thank you for saying I am wrong while providing no empirical evidence to support your ASSUMPTION. Those ultimatum blanket statements are much easier to dismiss. If you feel that \"technology will drive better than you,\" I am glad your vehicle presumably has this technology.  I like the way that looks although it seems there is a lot of previous generation Altima in the front end. It also looks good in this drawing because it has huge wheels and little gap between the wheel and fender. Mazda is reasonably good about filling wheel wells with tire and wheel, so we can wait and see what they produce.That last pic of the tan Honda Accord sedan looks a lot like a Saturn L300. I am guessing it has to do with the angle of the pic, and there is something Volvo S60/Peugeot about the front of the car. I can\\'t decide if I like it or not, but at least its interesting.  the wheels on the inside of the turn aren\\'t going to do very much even if the brakes are applied, and if they are then someone didn\\'t turn the wheel as hard as they should\\'ve in the first place, so its correction for driver error.Speaking of ASSUMPTIONS - where is your empirical evidence that braking the inside tire does nothing? The evidence from the auto mfrs says otherwise. Who should we believe?And if you\\'re in an understeer situation - how would turning the wheel more help?  This is still a sedan board right?  a couple of good cases in point both involving the same 3.0DT that from a competitive standpoint should\\'ve been laid to rest a long time ago given that both Nissan and Honda had superior V6s (Toyota was actually the Johnny-come-lately to this party) several years (2002 and 03) before the Fusion and/or the Five Hundred ever came to market. The Five Hundred originally was supposed to have the 3.5 in 2005, Ford can\\'t make enough of the engines, kills the car (renaming it the \"Taurus\") - you would think that they could have done something to help their lower volume \\'flagship\\' sedan that didn\\'t take more than 3 years. to do. The same sort of thing could be said about the Fusion - it would be the same sort of \\'rocket\\' (with 260hp) that the Camcordimas already were, so why bother with the car in the first place if an appropriate engine is not available for it and won\\'t be for maybe 5 years after introduction. Shooting themselves in the foot - again. Both cars deserve so much better.  Speaking of ASSUMPTIONS - where is your empirical evidence that braking the inside tire does nothing? The evidence from the auto mfrs says otherwise. Who should we believe?I didn\\'t say that braking the inside wheel does nothing, i said braking the inside wheel does nothing AT THE LIMIT. If there is no weight on that wheel, you could take it off the car and its not going to make a difference.I think this started when it was suggested that the system would improve handling. I think that is false. I think it lowers the limits of the vehicle and intervenes to compensate for the lack of driving ability of the general US populace. I am all for it. And if you\\'re in an understeer situation - how would turning the wheel more help?If you are in an \"over the limit\" understeer situation, like going wayyyy to fast into a turn, the front tires are so overloaded they aren\\'t going to take any more input, so braking a front wheel isn\\'t going to help. I would also suggest the inside rear wheel would be unloaded (see above) and dragging it isn\\'t going to provide a whole lot of benefit. Stability control is designed to prevent roll-overs and to keep the car from swapping ends. There was an earlier reference to dragging a foot on a bicycle; a different analogy might be training wheels on a bicycle. Its hard to fall over, but the lean angle is much less than what would be available otherwise.  and don\\'t forget...the current price concessions that Honda is putting on the current Accords will likely come to a screeching halt if the new model is received well. This will only increase the price gap between the accord vs fusions, sonata\\'s, and the 6. But who knows... maybe it will be worth the premium. Can\\'t wait to see it. by the way, pretty much all the car mags are saying that the v-6 accord is likely to get more HP (which usually means less mpg) but will have cylinder deactivation for hwy cruising. it\\'s also been noted that led taillights seem to be going away on the sedan based on the spy pics posted in this thread. perhaps it will be on the higher trim models, but the sedan spy pic definitely does not have led\\'s. not that i care btw, but just to throw it out there.  it\\'s also been noted that led taillights seem to be going away on the sedan based on the spy pics posted in this thread. perhaps it will be on the higher trim models, but the sedan spy pic definitely does not have led\\'s.Too bad. I really liked the LED taillights on the 2007 Accord. They look very cool and are probably a safety plus as well because of the brighter image.  I actually want to make my turn signals LED as they don\\'t seem very noticeable against the red LED\\'s.  Okay - let\\'s move on back to the cars themselves from here.  Too bad. I really liked the LED taillights on the 2007 Accord. They look very cool and are probably a safety plus as well because of the brighter image. I also like the LED\\'s on the current accord, they look very cool, and high tech. They seem to be catchin on as a design trend as both the Milan and Aura sport them. Hopefully the next Mazda6 will use them as well.  I actually want to make my turn signals LED as they don\\'t seem very noticeable against the red LED\\'s.I say go for it, It would give your accord some uniqueness. I personally like the Accord hybrid turn signals, the lens are white, with amber blinkers. Very sharp looking..!  While I certainly agree that the Accord is a fine mid-size automobile, it was also priced out of our range when we purchased a MSRP $27,105 V6 SEL AWD Fusion. I think the pricing on the accord will have a HUGE effect on sales. If, as others are saying, it looks like it borrowed for other midsizes, and doesn\\'t realy stand out, a high price could be bad for sales. people may not spend a couple thousand more for an unremarkable, yet well built and reliable, car. seriously doubt if Ford, GM or Chrysler will ever achieve the sales levels of the Camry or Accord in the mid-size market but that does not mean that their offerings are not competitive with what Toyota and Honda put forth. as unbelievable as it seems (even though I know its not a midsize, but it think it does compete with them) the impala is running neck and neck with the acord. it may even be outselling it now  by the way, pretty much all the car mags are saying that the v-6 accord is likely to get more HP (which usually means less mpg) but will have cylinder deactivation for hwy cruising. now that would be cool. I\\'ve heard of that in large V-8 trucks, but never a car.  \"All this talk about dealers and service departments has me thinking. I have been driving Accords for 16 years now, and as far as I\\'m concerned, my local dealer doesn\\'t need a service department. Do they even have a Service Department? Can\\'t say for sure. The only time I go to the local Honda dealer is to pick up maintenance items, and check out the new models. It is an Accord, after all. If I owned another brand, I would be concerned. \"Ditto! I can say the same about my Ford Fusion..   \"A friend of ours has worked as the service mgr at a Honda, Ford, Lincoln/Mercury, Dodge, and now Kia dealer. He claims the Honda service dept. was every bit as busy as any of the others. And not just for oil changes either because I know that\\'s what you are thinking. \"Agreed, my friend is a sales Manager at a medium sized Honda dealership. Their service bays are full, and not just with oil changes.. :shades:  now that would be cool. I\\'ve heard of that in large V-8 trucks, but never a car. Everything old is new againDCX MDSIt seems like they will continually find applications for this until all cars have it. I can\\'t see how this is a bad idea, the technology is there for seamless integration.The other fuel saving thing I am waiting for is the integrated alternator/starter, so the engine automatically shuts off at idle (like a Prius) and automatically restarts instantly when you press the gas.  Wow! Where did you get these renderings of the 09 Fusion?? I notice the tail lights are red and not the Jewel type..  now would that be as simple as simply shutting off 4 of the injectors? is there any reason the pistons couldn\\'t move without combustion? or is is some incredible complex technologial setup?  I think the pricing on the accord will have a HUGE effect on sales. If, as others are saying, it looks like it borrowed for other midsizes, and doesn\\'t realy stand out, a high price could be bad for sales. people may not spend a couple thousand more for an unremarkable, yet well built and reliable, car.um, as far as looks go of the current sedan, if you were to look up \"unremarkable\" in a dictionary, you may see a pic of an accord  yet they still sell tons of these cars. So long as they still have a good reputation and continue to get good press, I\\'ve no doubt the Accord will do well. And Honda has not been inclined to have huge increases in prices with a release of new models in the recent past (civic, odyssey). So if they keep the price about the same and come out with new features like HID headlights, cylinder deactivation, more efficient engines with more HP, and better crash tests (remember the Accord is slated to get a new chassis with better capability to absorb impacts - ACE I think it\\'s called), it will give Honda just enough to talk about how much better their new car is.  \"seriously doubt if Ford, GM or Chrysler will ever achieve the sales levels of the Camry or Accord in the mid-size market but that does not mean that their offerings are not competitive with what Toyota and Honda put forth.\"Dejavue! I am old enough to remember when the Taurus was a hot seller and GM/Ford pretty much dominated the sedan markets.. People said the same thing.. No way can Honda/Toyota catch Ford or GM in car sales..Well.. look what happened..   In my opinion a nice car but not a car that exudes character and styling. Once again Honda plays it safe and goes mainstream. Car just lacks a soul for me. I frankly like the rear end of the 07 Accords better. But, thousands will sell just because of the silver \"H\" if nothing else.. :sick:  I think the upper trim level of the odyssey has cylinder deactivation too, so it\\'s not new to Honda.  Vacation to Maui! Had a great time.. I had a rental car, it was a Dodge Avenger. At first I was excited to try something different. It wore off really quick. As I entered the car.. talk about cheap plastics!! The instrument panel cover was falling off! I pushed it back and clipped it back into place. During the week it came off again. The engine was a 4cyl engine and very, very loud and rough. So rough the car shook at idle. Acceleration was so loud and rough I tried my best not to accelerate!.. I could not believe Dodge would build a car like this and think it could even come close to compete with a 4cyl Honda/Toyota/Ford/Sonata/Mazda or what ever. (I have test driven most of the main players in the 4cyl family sedan arena.) The transmission was very clunky and at somepoints shifts were so hard it shook the car. My wife and kids hated the seats, kids hated the back seats because the seats sat so far back they could not see out of the windows very well. I was very disappointed in Dodge. The outside styling was nice and aggressive in my opinion. Go test drive one of these for yourself. The car had 2,300 miles on it also.By the way.. Saw loads of Toyota Camry\\'s as rentals and on the rental lot next do Dollar.. :surprise:  Ford can\\'t make enough of the engines, kills the car (renaming it the \"Taurus\") - you would think that they could have done something to help their lower volume \\'flagship\\' sedan that didn\\'t take more than 3 years.The DT35 was delayed so they could make it competitive now and in the future. Originally it was just going to be a larger DT30 but they beefed some things up and made allowances for turbo, hybrid, and DI applications which is the future proof part. It is very competitive with the offerings from Honda, Toyota, Nissan, and GM right now and will remain competitive for years to come. At least that\\'s what I\\'ve gathered over the past couple of years while waiting for it. :blush: Why it\\'s not going into the Fusion I don\\'t know. But I do think that the rumored 240 HP PIP DT30 with a 6-speed ATX will be competitive. Not class leading, but competitive. If the other rumor about the DI turbo 2.5L I4 for the \\'09 Fusion are true then there\\'s your answer to the power \"problem\".  I think the upper trim level of the odyssey has cylinder deactivation too, so it\\'s not new to Honda. It does and it\\'s like $37k!!!!! I hope they don\\'t charge a premium for the same tech in the Accord. No one will buy it if they do IMO.  The same sort of thing could be said about the Fusion - it would be the same sort of \\'rocket\\' (with 260hp) that the Camcordimas already were, so why bother with the car in the first place if an appropriate engine is not available for it and won\\'t be for maybe 5 years after introduction. I can\\'t see how that hurts sales though and that\\'s the bottom line. I\\'ve already stated my case on how the Fusion\\'s V6 is a good, if not excellent, compromise to the overpriced V6s of the Camcords and the less powerful I4s of all three. It\\'s priced in the middle and makes people happy as shown by total V6 sales for all three. The Fusion V6 falls right in the middle of the V6s of others and the I4s of all in the class in every category including the all important price category.  yep, I remember those V8-6-4s that Cadillac championed many many years ago, a disaster for GM if I recall correctly not too much unlike GM trying to make diesel engines out of their small block V8s - leading to things like excessive recalls, extended warranties, and crappy resale values. Things like this a good part of the fall of the \\'Detroit\\' empire - meaning they can\\'t build smaller engines well, so let\\'s try these \\'tricks\\' - and further proof that technology is not always good. My own observation of the system in operation in a 300C is that it is almost undetectable except that it won\\'t hold the car\\'s speed without reverting back to 8 cylinders at any speed over about 65 or so - even on a flat road. Maybe a part of the reason that the 300C has been listed (by CR) as the most overrated in terms of EPA FE ratings? Haven\\'t heard of any reliability issues with these new systems though, so I guess that something has gotten a little easier to do since way back when.  An engine is just a big air pump. I think to deactivate cylinders they probably do something with the valves, the ignition and or the fuel. I also would think they stagger (or even vary) which pistons are firing an which ones aren\\'t. The pistons would increase parasitic loss but probably not too much. This is pretty much the same way a Jake Brake works on a diesel engine.  I can\\'t see how that hurts sales though and that\\'s the bottom linerespectively suggest that your head may be in the sand. Camcordimas outsell Fusions by about 10 to 1. Why? The Fusion is otherwise an intelligently designed and competitive car at least until you pop the hoods. A quick check shows a rebate and/or financing incentives available right now on the Fusion but NOTHING on the other 3. And this is all because the Fusion is selling well? It may be selling well for a sedan with a blue oval on it, but certainly not relative to the real players in this class. Had Ford been able to put refined and efficient engines in the Fusion - we wouldn\\'t be having this conversation now.And sure a Camcordima is \\'overpriced\\' (your word) relative to things like Fusions - at least until it comes time to trade them in. Or maybe if initial purchase price is what determines \\'overpriced\\' then the Sonata ought to be the sedan of choice - it does, at least, have a better engine that you can certainly get for about the same number as a Camcordima 4 banger, resale values and TCO be damned!  37k for a freaking minivan??? wow... maybe I was wrong in saying that the Accord will be priced about the same as the current one. Hopefully it won\\'t be priced like the Accord Hybrid was... that\\'d be a dog!  impala is running neck and neck with the acord.the Impala has always been relatively high on the \\'sales\\' charts, except for one thing the numbers of them bid into corporate and municipal fleets, and rental lots. It\\'s a wonder that GM doesn\\'t run out of white paint especially considering how much money they lose giving the car away in this manner. The Accord OTH is really SOLD to REAL BUYERS who have those nasty things called car payments!  Took a fairly long trip (couple hours each way) and was pleased to get 28 mpg with 90% highway miles. The roads were hilly and I tend to try to find my way through pockets of traffic by liberally using the accelerator when the opportunity arises for safe maneouvers, so I\\'m sure someone who put the cruise on at 70mph would get considerably better #\\'s than me. I also should mention that I stay 7-10 mph faster than the posted speed limit when I can, so again, at these speeds, it\\'s not ideal for getting the max mpg. But hey, I enjoyed the drive so that\\'s that. Probably not the best for this class, but certainly not bad I think.  \"It does and it\\'s like $37k!!!!! I hope they don\\'t charge a premium for the same tech in the Accord. No one will buy it if they do IMO.\" Cylinder de-activation is available in from the EX-L trim levels up in the Honda Odyssey; these can typically be had for around 28k. Honda does not charge extra for this technology, nor will it do so in the Accord.  Ditto! I can say the same about my Ford Fusion..You\\'ve had a Fusion for 16 years?  Just messing with ya...The Fusion is looking like a very reliable automobile!  I think the upper trim level of the odyssey has cylinder deactivation too, so it\\'s not new to Honda. It does and it\\'s like $37k!!!!! I hope they don\\'t charge a premium for the same tech in the Accord. Um, it\\'s $31k for a model with cylinder deactivation, heated leather, dual climate, and a bunch of other options  Honda does not charge extra for this technology, nor will it do so in the Accord.Oh really? Why isn\\'t it offered throughout the entire Odyssey range? Have any actual proof? Do you know exactly where it\\'ll be offered on the Accord, whether or not it\\'ll be on the LX or just the EX?  respectively suggest that your head may be in the sand. Camcordimas outsell Fusions by about 10 to 1. Why?Not in the V6 arena though which is where your head is in the sand. :P Very few Camcords are sold with the V6 and the majority of Fusions are sold with the V6. If the V6 in the Fusion is so bad then why is it selling so well?BTW, the F-150 outsells everything and it has the weakest engines of all pickups. Having a more powerful V6 in the mid-sized sedan segment does not increase sales overall. IMO, if Honda and Toyota offered only the I4 their sales would not drop all that much. Their reputations and overall \"goodness\" of the products they offer appeal to the masses and THAT is what drives the sales. What doesn\\'t drive sales is having 40 more horses than the other guy in their lowest volume copies. It helps them sell some V6 copies over the other guys but not the big sellers which are I4s.A quick check shows a rebate and/or financing incentives available right now on the Fusion but NOTHING on the other 3.Maybe in your area that\\'s true but right now I can get $1000 off of a Fusion V6 SEL ($250 more if my VIN meets a certain criteria, whatever that means, and push the dealer), $1950 off of an Accord V6 sedan if I push the dealer, and $2000 (or $2500 with some coupon)off of a Sonata Limited V6. BTW, you guys didn\\'t belive me that there was $3000 in dealer cash last year on the Accord in this area. We\\'re now up to $1950. I\\'ll get back to all of you doubters when it reaches $3000 or more in a month or two.   Oh really? Why isn\\'t it offered throughout the entire Odyssey range? That\\'s what I was getting at. You can\\'t just go buy any old Odyssey and get the cylinder deactivation. The $37k one was the only one with it at the last car show I went to and it was actually equipped the way we\\'d want it. I\\'m guessing the $31k \"base\" cylinder deactivation model is sans leather, DVD, reverse sensing, etc.? My point was to show how the Accord may not have that tech all the way through the V6 line. I\\'d bet you\\'ll have to get the EX-L at a minimum for that feature and you can all bet that there is a premium for that tech worked into the price tag. Probably not much but it\\'s surely there. I respectively say your heads are in the sand if you don\\'t believe that as captain2 would say. :P  I posted the estimated V6 sales figures and the Fusion was very close to the Camcords in actual volume because they sell only about 20% V6 Camcords and 40-60% V6 Fusion/Milans.If power is so important then why didn\\'t the new Camry V6 dramatically increase Camry sales?The fact is it\\'s hard to harness 260 hp in a small fwd car. I don\\'t see getting much higher without AWD.  The fact is it\\'s hard to harness 260 hp in a small fwd car. I don\\'t see getting much higher without AWD.1. The Camry is not small2. The FWD TL-S (relatively same size as the Camry) has 287HP and almost no torque steer.The reason why the V6 Camry/Accord is sold at less percentage is because of the higher price. A V6 Fusion or Sonata is almost comparable in price to a middle-to-top-of-the-line Accord or Camry.  it\\'s also been noted that led taillights seem to be going away on the sedan based on the spy pics posted in this thread. perhaps it will be on the higher trim models, but the sedan spy pic definitely does not have led\\'s.Too bad. I really liked the LED taillights on the 2007 Accord. They look very cool and are probably a safety plus as well because of the brighter image.  The reason doesn\\'t matter - the fact is that a large majority of buyers of midsize sedans choose 4 cylinder models over 6 cylinder models. Period. More powerful V6 models won\\'t really change that.  So basically you are saying Toyota and Honda should just tell the V6 buyers to s***w themselves since they are not the majority? Just because other manufactures have less-than-desirable V6 engines for their midsizers doesn\\'t mean that Honda/Toyota/Nissan should stop pushing the envelope. I, for one, appreciate what the [non-permissible content removed] big 3 are doing and am willing to pay the premium for a more refined and powerful V6 midsizer.  No, I\\'m saying that V6 horsepower is insignificant to overall sales volumes. Most buyers will choose a vehicle, then choose the engine. Only a few enthusiasts care that the Camry V6 has 260+ hp versus the Accord 240 vs. the Fusion 221 and an even smaller number of buyers would choose the Camry over the Accord or Fusion simply because of the V6 engine.  No, I\\'m saying that V6 horsepower is insignificant to overall sales volumes.Maybe you are right, but it\\'s a good opportunity for the manufactures to showcase their latest technology in a mainstream market. Good publicity too. Another example is the new Lexus LS. Does anybody on this planet need a car with 8-speed auto tranny and that it can park itself? Heck no. Is it a significant factor why people buy that car? I don\\'t think so either. However, it does make Lexus looks good though.  The FWD TL-S (relatively same size as the Camry) has 287HP and almost no torque steer.I\\'d have to agree with akirby on all accounts. I\\'ve driven my cousin\\'s \\'06 TL and it has plenty of torque steer. Unless Honda did something similar to what Mazda does in the MAZDASPEED3 to reduce torque steer, I don\\'t see how the TL-S has almost none and I don\\'t see how adding more power to these mainstream machines will produce different results. One of the biggest complaints from MT, C&D, and the like about the TL has been it\\'s torque steer. See here. Quote from the link:\"While 270 horsepower from a six-cylinder seems reason enough to purchase a TL over less-potent competitors--BMW 330i and the Lexus IS 300--torque steer (the TL is a front-driver) remains an always-present problem whenever the engine is delivering max juice. Suggested one editor: \"If Acura wants to sell a front-drive car with this much horsepower, the engineers should figure how to tune out the wheel wiggle.\"\"The reason why the V6 Camry/Accord is sold at less percentage is because of the higher price.Exactly!!! And the Fusion V6 sells much better than the others because it is a good compromise in most ways. If people were so concerned about HP then the opposite would be true.  So basically you are saying Toyota and Honda should just tell the V6 buyers to s***w themselves since they are not the majority?No, but they are limiting their V6 sales by making it cost more. It\\'s a pretty big premium for the Camry and Accord V6 when you think about it. I\\'d imagine Joe shopper just wants a little more power for not a lot of $$. These two offer a lot more power for a lot more $$ and that puts it in enthusiast terrritory IMO. You\\'re playing with the likes of the SPEED6 and Subie Legacy GT at those prices and those are both better performers all around for the same money.  From Edmunds Inside Line:Putting the power downYou might suspect a front-driver with 256 lb-ft of twisting torque to be a tarmac-nibbling handful and it would have been had it not also included a helical-gear-type limited-slip differential (LSD) in the six-speed manual transmission. This long-standing torque-steer-reduction scheme works by dividing the driving force more equally between the two front wheels. In the case of the TL Type-S, it works very well. The only time we noticed the steering affected by the throttle was at the very top of both 1st and 2nd gear under full throttle. Otherwise, the car\\'s cornering was tack-sharp both off and on the gas. The LSD also does an admirable job of diminishing understeer. First Drive: 2007 Acura TL Type-SI also test drove the TL-S last December. The torque is minimal but not completely gone.PS. I would assume we are well on our way to \"off-topic-discussion land\" already? :P  I would like to see a link that shows the $1,950 in dealer cash. Everyplace I have looked has it at $750.  I would like to see a link that shows the $1,950 in dealer cash. Everyplace I have looked has it at $750It was in my post. They had it separated out into $750 and $1200 for some reason but didn\\'t state why. Link again.Keep in mind that this is in my region and YMMV.   I would assume we are well on our way to \"off-topic-discussion land\" already?Nah. I think we can at least both agree that torque steer can be managed in several ways. How it\\'s done is the key. Mazda eliminated it in the SPEED6 using AWD and in the SPEED3 using sensors to limit power in gears 1 and 2 and some other little tricks. Acura used an LSD but didn\\'t seem to completely eliminate it. Which tradeoff do you want is the big question.  But McDonald\\'s undercuts Wendy\\'s on price, which helps it to garner more sales.Honda doesn\\'t undercut anybodies price.  Mazda eliminated it in the SPEED6 using AWD ...We have a 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion and don\\'t notice any torque steer. Is that because of the AWD feature?  In part but the Fusion doesn\\'t have any torque steer that I\\'ve ever heard of to begin with. My dad\\'s Zephyr doesn\\'t have any and it\\'s FWD and my former Mazda6 didn\\'t have any either. I don\\'t see why the Fusion would differ and somehow have torque steer in FWD form.  I\\'m taking a guess they are shown separately because the $750 started May 1 and they bumped the incentive another $1200 on June 1. \"Both\" incentives end on the same day.   ... and my former Mazda6 didn\\'t have any either.What do you have now? Just curious.  \\'06 Mustang GT. No torque steer on that either. :shades:  But McDonald\\'s undercuts Wendy\\'s on price, which helps it to garner more sales. Honda doesn\\'t undercut anybodies price. In addition, McDonald\\'s has stores everywhere (like Ford dealerships) where Wendy\\'s are a bit harder to find (like Honda stores).But, Honda still sells more Accords.  It\\'s because it has \"only\" 221 HP instead of TL-S\\' 287 HP.  I\\'m taking a guess they are shown separately because the $750 started May 1 and they bumped the incentive another $1200 on June 1. \"Both\" incentives end on the same day. You\\'re probably right. The $750 one has been there a while. I think the nationwide Accord incentive is the lease deal which seems like a pretty good deal to me.  In addition, McDonald\\'s has stores everywhere (like Ford dealerships) where Wendy\\'s are a bit harder to find (like Honda stores). But, Honda still sells more Accords.So in conclusion the Mac vs. Wendy\\'s is a horrible example for Camcord vs. Fusion. :P  Why does it surprise you that Dodge would make such a crappy car? Haven\\'t you ever owned a Dodge? Ever known someone that has? It should not surprise you in the least bit that Chrysler is making the worst vehicles (by far) on the road today.  Very few Camcords are sold with the V6 and the majority of Fusions are sold with the V6. If the V6 in the Fusion is so bad then why is it selling so well? This one is easy to answer. Honda and Toyota have the best 4 cylinder\\'s in the business, and therefore many opt for that engine choice. Ford doesn\\'t have a viable or decent 4 cylinder, so everyone gets the \"somewhat decent\" V6.  Isn\\'t the Camry\\'s V6 more like 270 HP than 260?Isn\\'t the Accord\\'s V6 244HP these days?Is Fusion\\'s exactly 221 small ponies?  Those two cash to dealer incentives are seperate. The $1200 is for some models EX and up, and the $750 is for the rest. You get one or the other not both.Check the Accord prices paid board.  Mazda eliminated it in the SPEED6 using AWD and in the SPEED3 using sensors to limit power in gears 1 and 2 and some other little tricks. Acura used an LSD but didn\\'t seem to completely eliminate it. Which tradeoff do you want is the big question.Some cars have a low speed only traction control to help them get started on slippery surfaces with an automatic transmission Some cars have \"all speed\" traction control which uses sensors to limit wheel slip. The all speed traction control can also use the system to limit torque steer by retarding engine output. A limited slip makes the car want to go straight, I would think that would exacerbate torque steer by pulling the car in the direction of traction. In FWD cars, using \"equal length\" half shafts supposedly helps also (I\\'m not refuting that at all, I just haven\\'t looked into it that much).AWD (w/diffs) just distributes the power to more places, so each place can handle more of the job of transmitting power before it gets overwhelmed. I think the old \\'89 Probe GT had the most torque steer of any vehicle I\\'d ever driven, short of a highly modified early 90s Maxima. Does the Acura have a real limited slip like a torsen or something?  Those two cash to dealer incentives are seperate. The $1200 is for some models EX and up, and the $750 is for the rest. You get one or the other not both.Then why are both listed together on the EX-L V6 ATX with no statement that they can or cannot be combined? Regardless, $1200 is more than the $1000 on the Fusion albeit you have to work for the one from Honda and the Fusion cash is on the hood.The initial statement said there were no incentives on the Sonata and Accord and all I was doing was proving that wrong. Whether it\\'s $1200 or $1950 there is still a cash incentive on both in some regions right?  Some cars have a low speed only traction control to help them get started on slippery surfaces with an automatic transmission So my Mustang has a manual tranny and traction control but I can still spin the wheels with the TC on. In the snow the system kicks in right away and retards the engine and brakes the rear wheels to get me going. Is that the same thing, and how does it know there\\'s snow on the road or that I\\'m doing a burnout? You seem like you might know, no? :confuse:  Does your Mustang have a real mechanical limited slip also? My understanding of the way it works is it looks at how fast all of the wheels are going and grabs the one that is too far out of range and slows it down. On slippery surfaces, you can have your drive wheels going 30 with the front wheels not moving. If you do a burn out, I don\\'t think the variation is that much, you don\\'t need the drive wheels to be going that much faster than the non-drive wheels. It also might be less sensitive if both drive wheels are going faster than the 2 non-drive wheels.ABS is also based on the speed difference between the wheels, so in low speed conditions, even if one wheel is going 5 or 10 and the other wheel is going 0, it might not be a big enough difference and the wheel may lock.On my Contour w/o traction control, when starting and driving on a low traction surface, the ABS sensors can\\'t get a sync so the system can\\'t initialize, presumably because all the wheels are going different speeds passed the speed where it does its snapshot (I think its 7 mph or so). This flags the ABS light and I don\\'t have ABS until the vehicle is ignition is cycled. Oh, and I didn\\'t mean to imply that only automatic transmission vehicles can have TC. I think it is more important for auto trans cars however, since its easier to modulate the torque and power going to the wheels with the clutch.  I was estimating. What\\'s your point?  Does your Mustang have a real mechanical limited slip also?It sure does. I did notice that when the TC did come on this past winter there was that clicking/grinding sound you hear when the ABS comes on during braking and it seemed to originate from around the master cylinder somewhere.I ask all of this because the Mazda6 I had previously seemed to have the same type of system where it did allow for some wheel spin. Not as much as the Mustang does but moreso than our Explorer or any other TC equipped vehicle I\\'ve ever driven. Are TC systems pretty standard out of a box or is there a large allowance for customization?Oh, and I didn\\'t mean to imply that only automatic transmission vehicles can have TC. I think it is more important for auto trans cars however, since its easier to modulate the torque and power going to the wheels with the clutch.Agreed on all accounts. That\\'s one of the reasons I like driving a stick so much actually. Way more control IMO.  V6 in the Fusion is so bad then why is it selling so well?it isn\\'t selling well - the answer to your question as to why a majority of Ford have the V6 is 1) because it is cheap and 2) because the 4 cylinder is that bad. There have been a number of posts on this forum discussing whether or not a 4 cylinder Accord can really keep up with a 6 cylinder Fusion, I guess it turns out to be close except in one area - the Accord 4 banger is a smoother and more refined engine than any V6 DT ever thought of being and obviously burns a whole lot less petrol. Dealer discounts on an outgoing model designs are bad examples for comparison purposes - but if they are starting to discount the 07 Accords like you claim, it certainly should make the car that much less expensive to own than a Fusion.  the Accord 4 banger is a smoother and more refined engine than any V6 DT ever thought of being and obviously burns a whole lot less petrol. I\\'ll second that. But a 4 cyl Nissan Altima can hang with it. Its that good.  as a former owner of some great Altima 4 bangers, I can\\'t say I disagree - but - IMO, it is Honda that still (remember the CVCC 4 bangers back in the late 70s) sets the standard in 4 cylinder engines specifically - not necessarily in HP but how wonderfully smooth and quiet they are, and yes more so in that regard than certainly the DT 3.0. The only real point that I\\'ve been trying to make for months now is that the Fusion in particular would be a whole lot better and easily a more competitive car in this class if Ford somehow could manage to put engines in it similar to what everybody else now is doing. to akirby that thinks most folks pick a car and then pick an engine to go with it - maybe so - but not this buyer - I\\'ll do it exactly the other way around. A rough feeling, coarse sounding engine is what makes or breaks my driving pleasures. It is almost worth buying the 4 cylinder Accord with only the MT just for the experience of how it sounds and feels as you encourage the engine do what it does best.  Why does it surprise you that Dodge would make such a crappy car? Haven\\'t you ever owned a Dodge? Ever known someone that has? It should not surprise you in the least bit that Chrysler is making the worst vehicles (by far) on the road today. The 300/Charger/Magnum are very good. It\\'s the small and midsize DCX cars that aren\\'t good. I would name GM,Ford,Hyundai,Suzuki and Kia as worst.  I\\'m not completely sold on the Charger/Magnum. Let\\'s look at what CR has to say in 3 years about these cars.   I\\'m guessing the $31k \"base\" cylinder deactivation model is sans leather, DVD, reverse sensing, etc.? Check out my post from earlier (#2568). It is not a \"Base\" model. It is an EX with heated leather, power doors, 6CD, Three-Zone Climate Control, etc...not a cloth strippo/base model. Honda\\'s website will give you more info than I\\'m willing to divulge since this is a Sedan thread.$37k is a loaded \"Touring\" model with either NAVI or DVD, the highest available trim level on the Odyssey.  If I had to guess, he was picking up on the selective rounding down of the competitors horsepower, versus getting the Fusion\\'s exactly right. Doesn\\'t seem accidental. It\\'s also not something I would go out of my way to point out; that\\'s just what it looks like happened to me.  My 2006 Hyundai has been far more reliable, and trouble-free, than my 2007 Toyota Camry. For those who speak about reliability without ever owning distinct samples, I provide empirical experience owning both a Hyundai and Toyota. Surprised, yes, I am, but facts don\\'t lie. The Hyundai has never seen the dealer for a warranty issue; the Toyota has been into the dealer 4 times since its purchase for warranty issues. Overall build-quality on the Hyundai, including panel gaps and matching, as well as other aspects are the equal to the Toyota. A crappy car Hyundai is not . . ., it\\'s no longer the late \\'80s.  For my buddies on this board who had followed my progress after getting hit in my 1996 Accord, I thought I\\'d let you know that it went as smoothly as I could\\'ve ever asked for. The other driver\\'s insurance covered the entire thing (he DID hit me after all), and I got my car back from the body shop today. Looks as close to perfect as an 11 year old car could look in my opinion. I\\'m as pleased as punch to have it back, too. I have a 2006, but my \\'96 is my daily driver into the city to work (yes, with 173k miles).So, with that, I close this chapter of life with my first car.Thanks to those who were concerned!  Perhaps that\\'s because I own a Fusion and not a Camcord - and I didn\\'t feel like going to look up the others. Besides - that wasn\\'t the point.  So long as they still have a good reputation and continue to get good press, I\\'ve no doubt the Accord will do well. I\\'d put my money on it selling well, but things are different now, than when the last gen was released. the last year or two, honda has been offering great deals on accords, better than I ever remember seeing. those will dissapear. and with the midsize market much more competitive this time, a significant price increase could be trouble. throw into that the fact that being the #2 midsize, every car company is taking direct aim at it and the camry. every comercial you see is basicly \"our car is better than the camcord for this reason\". and with the competetion holding the line on their prices, honda doesn\\'t want to be know as \"the most expensive midsize\"now on the flip side, if they can do like nissan did (the 2007 altima only went up $200 from the 2006 price) they just may pass the camry and take that best selling car spot away from toyota.  That\\'s great grad, glad to hear it!!  I\\'ll second that. But a 4 cyl Nissan Altima can hang with it. Its that good. and as an 07 altima 2.5 owner, I\\'ll second that. I\\'m not going to proclaim it the best I4 out there, but coupled with that CVT, there wont be much difference between it and the 1st or 2nd best four banger out there. driving that thing around, Its sometimes hard to believe its only 4 cylinders. I can\\'t even imagine what the VQ must be like.  \"The reason why the V6 Camry/Accord is sold at less percentage is because of the higher price. A V6 Fusion or Sonata is almost comparable in price to a middle-to-top-of-the-line Accord or Camry. \"BINGO!! This hits it right on the money.

On the newer subies, they have put much better sound absorbing material so you don\\'t hear it unless you get out of your car, but it always seemed that the boxer engine just didn\\'t hold a candle to the Accord engine in my previous car. Now that I have the v-6 mazda6, I think this car sounds so much better than the other two cars. While it is quiet when puttering around town, at higher rpms a nice growl comes from the heart of the car. It has a deeper throatier tone to it, especially compared to most 4 cylinders, that builds nicely in volume and tone as power and speed grow. While the 4 cylinder version of the mazda6 was quite fun and just a little more than a second slower than the v-6, it just didn\\'t have the broader torque curve or the sweet sound of the v-6. So I think most consumers who are used to the higher pitched whine of a 4 banger, a nicely tuned v-6 would sound much better to buyers who like the sensory experiences of driving.  I have gotten used to the Legacy sound. I like it, I like the feeling that there is a motor in the front and you can hear it. The engine output shaft is inline with the car (its not transverse mounted engine like most of the cars in the class) and you can feel it torquing a little against its mounts.I definitely don\\'t see the Legacy as the model of refinement, but I am not ready for the retirement home just yet so having a car that feels like a car doesn\\'t bother me that much. I actually would strongly consider a Legacy 2.5GT sedan but we already have a wagon and I can\\'t bring myself to get two of the same car.The Contour\\'s little V6 sounded good when it was working hard, but the 4 cylinder SR20 in the older Sentras did too. I think it has a lot to do with the intake and exhaust designs (both cars had Borlas and a CAI).  Honda does not charge extra for this technology, nor will it do so in the Accord.What I posted was what I feel Honda will do, just like you post what you feel Madza or Ford \\'will\\' do with the 08 or 09 models. Get it?What you said before was stated as a fact and a certainty when really there is no way for you to know. Nobody has been saying with any certainty or brashness about what Mazda or Ford will do. We have been commenting on the rumors and thinking about what changes we think would improve these cars. Where in your first post did you say or even suggest that there was any doubt?  Sorry, I should have been more clear...my legacy was a 2.5 from 1996. I test drove the 2005 legacy non-gt and it sounded much better and more refined. The thing that I really liked about that car was it\\'s acceleration from a stop...maybe it\\'s a torqueier engine or the awd gives it great grip, but off the line, it was pretty quick. So while the engine is not perfect or the best, the Legacy/ Outback is still a great car that I have not hesitated to recommend to friends.  I didn\\'t mean to make it sound like I was refuting your statement, I think the Subie\\'s motor is a bit less refined feeling than say, the VQ or the Toyota one that Captain likes. I just happened to like the way the boxer engine feels in that application, and it has been returning very good fuel economy.I have no hesitation recommending the Subaru to friends and family, but at the same time, if you don\\'t want AWD and tend to be neglectful of maintenance, I think there are more robust choices.  How is GM/Ford worst? at what? Midsize for GM:W-Body which consists of Midsize cars LaCrosse, Grand Prix and ImpalaPlatform that is almost 20 years old. V6 Engine which dates back to the 50\\'s unless you pay a lot more and get the V8 engine which has way too much power for a FWD car.Junk by todays standards.Lucerne (H platform) is nose heavy being FWD and having a iron block 3800 engine. High fuel consumption and again an aging platform. Midsize FordI like the Fusion but it doesn\\'t get a 5 star safety ratings that the LX cars have. Engine is kind of weak for a V6. The 500/Taurus is a disappointment but will improve with the 3.5L engine. I feel American car manufacturers are best at making RWD cars with big engines. They can\\'t compete with Asians in the lightweight FWD segment.  Lucerne (H platform) is nose heavy being FWD and having a iron block 3800 engine. High fuel consumption and again an aging platform. It\\'s a Cadillac DTS for less money if you get the CXS. V8 engine? Check. Cadillac suspension? Check. Torque steer and nose-heavy feeling gone? Absolutely. There\\'s such a vast difference between the base model they churn out for rental fleets and the CXS that it really drives and feels like two different manufacturers were involved.

Nobody has been saying with any certainty or brashness about what Mazda or Ford will do. We have been commenting on the rumors and thinking about what changes we think would improve these cars. Where in your first post did you say or even suggest that there was any doubt?Thanks for making my point.OT, a co-worker, after driving Camrys for the past 10 years or so, just bought a Saturn Aura XR, and hasn\\'t stopped raving about how much BETTER it is than her previous \\'05 Camry. I had the chance of riding in the Aura last evening, and it\\'s definitely a smooth operator. The V6 is very polished, no NVH issues to speak of, and as quiet as a Lexus IMO. The interior fit-and-finish was excellent, and the seats were very comfortable without inducing sleep. The ride was smooth, but it still doesn\\'t handle as well as my 6 does. I was impressed.The CamCords may not be concerned about the Fusion, but between the Sonata (which offers an excellent product for an excellent price), and the Aura (a smooth, quiet, capable, well-built vehicle), they should be a little concerned, IMO.  Got questions...what model of Camry(s) did your co-worker own for the past 10 years or so? Was it1. V6 or I4?2. CE, LE, XLE or SE?Not trying to bash the Aura here and indeed it is a great effort from GM but it is not even in the same zip code with the Lexus in any category.  a great effort from GM but it is not even in the same zip code with the Lexus in any category.The new Ford Edge is quieter than a Lexus RX350. It happens.  \"Honda and Toyota have the best 4 cylinder\\'s in the business, and therefore many opt for that engine choice. Ford doesn\\'t have a viable or decent 4 cylinder, so everyone gets the \"somewhat decent\" V6. \" That would have been a good observation years ago, but now there are some excellent four cylinder engines including GM\\'s Echotech which is breaking or has broken all of Honda\\'s performance related records and is the most popular four cylinder in drag racing. I will take the Echotech if given a choice for durability, longevity.  Midsize for GM: W-Body which consists of Midsize cars LaCrosse, Grand Prix and Impala \"Platform that is almost 20 years old.

Lucerne (H platform) is nose heavy being FWD and having a iron block 3800 engine. High fuel consumption and again an aging platform.\"Your observations are all ill conceived and way off the truth. The previously standard 3.8 L engine is a different engine put on the market in the 1980\\'s. It had always been known as a best in class but is now dated by comparison with some of the high tech engines and has been and is being replaced. But that doesn\\'t mean it was bad. It was replaced by the 3.5 L engine with optional 3.6 L and 3.9 L engines available. The V8 is not a big extra expense option like a Lexus or other car would be. You can get a V8 equipt Impala/Lucerne/Grand Prix for around $30,000 last I looked. How many four door cars do you know of that can be had with a V8 starting around $30,000? You say a front wheel drive can\\'t handle a V8, says who? Cadillac/Buick/Oldsmobile had used them from the 1960\\'s to the 1980\\'s. I have driven those cars and they were fine. For drag racing that would not be a good choice, but for everyday normal driving you wouldn\\'t notice the difference. A suppose an aging platform doesn\\'t make a car bad especially when you have such a nice quiet ride and very respectible handling for a large car when equipt with the right suspension. The only thing I see as junk is your post.  How many four door cars do you know of that can be had with a V8 starting around $30,000?why on earth would you want them when you can buy something for the same price (the Azera, Avalon, and Maxima come to mind) that will not only outrun (in the case of the Northstar and/or damn near run with (the Impalas/GPs) AND save you several mpgs while they do it. Attacking deficiencies with displacement IS something that \\'Detroit\\' has always been good at, BUT it is also something that doesn\\'t work real well as gas gets up to $4-5/gallon. The Impala SS BTW is a torque steering handful with all that weight and HP/torque hitting those particular front wheels, guess the new 4000lb+ RWD model will address that issue at the expense of even more gas...  Ford cars are competitive, their engines are NOTI would say fords new DT35 is competitive, having the pleause of sampling this engine in a MKZ, its very smooth, potent and polished. It deffinately moves out with authority in a vehicle the size of a MKZ, but when anchored to a heavy Taurus you will get diluted 0-60 times.  \"What you said before was stated as a fact and a certainty when really there is no way for you to know.

There are a lot of posts I see here on what Mazda or Ford will do, and not many of them have \\'IMO\\' in them.  finally an intelligent post on this subject - you may be right, the 3.5 might just be competitive, I\\'ve read some conflicting reviews on the engine\\'s \\'smoothness\\' but the HP is sure there.

Should we all start wildly speculating about future products?  Well, my speculation and \"assumptions\" are based in the fact that those would be the NUMBERS any logical person would come up with if they looked at what Honda did with the last generation Accord in terms of improving HP and Gas Mileage at the same time. This would just be the same size leap as \"last time.\"  Haven\\'t we already started speculating talking about the 2009 Fusion?

AFAIC, the Aura is not only a \"great effort from GM\", but it\\'s a great effort from ANY automaker that can stand toe-to-toe with the class leaders. When a former Camry owner, who swore up and down she\\'d never buy \"American\" again, decides on an Aura after test-driving the other offerings (Camry, Accord, Altima, Milan), that\\'s saying something.  I haven\\'t seen anything about the 09 Fusion having X hp and getting Y/Z mileage.  Well, my speculation and \"assumptions\" are based in the fact that those would be the NUMBERS any logical person would come up with if they looked at what Honda did with the last generation Accord in terms of improving HP and Gas Mileage at the same time.I\\'m a very logical person and I wouldn\\'t have come up with those numbers.

Perhaps as far as you and your colleague are concerned, but not as far as one of edmunds.com\\'s editors is...CR doesn\\'t rate the Aura very highly either.Fortunately, my colleague and I can form our own opinions and buy what WE want from our own test-drives and observations, and NOT from what some (biased or unbiased) publication tells us.Unlike some of the lemmings out there, I personally can\\'t stand CR, and some of their opinions are so laughable that I highly doubt there\\'s a car nut on their staff. They\\'ve got plenty of nuts, but...

If she \"swore\" to never buy American again, and then did so with the Aura this year, she must be a very dishonest person going back on her word, and sworn testimony.   \"The Impala SS BTW is a torque steering handful with all that weight and HP/torque hitting those particular front wheels, guess the new 4000lb+ RWD model will address that issue at the expense of even more gas... As I said, unless you are drag racing the front drive car with V8, it is as normal as any other car. My friends dad had a 1973 Eldorado convertible with the 500 ci engine that definately had torque steer when peeling out, but his father only let him drive it on his birthday, and his father didn\\'t have a traction problem when he drove it himself. Buick put a V8 engine in the car to attract the kind of buyers that want a V8. Heck, you can get a four cylinder car to outperform a V8 car, so to each his own. On the Impala forums those who drive there V8 SS cars hard have noticed the torque steer, but you get used to it. In another year or so the Impala/Grandprix (G8) will be going to rear-wheel drive for people like you. The Buick might as well stay front wheel for the extra security in winter traction.  Sitting in an Aura on the show room floor is one thing. Driving it 10,000 is another. But the true test is 4+ years and 75,000+ miles later. That\\'s where the Accord shines. The Aura is an unknown. I like the Aura initially, but I don\\'t understand this automatic upgrade to CamCord contender right out of the gate.  And I\\'ve driven both the Aura and the Fusion (along with the Camcords), I\\'d much prefer the Fusion, despite its lower output.Also note the designation \"FWIW\" in my post.FWIW, my wife and I are the proud owners of a V6 2007 SEL AWD Fusion and like most everything about it EXCEPT for its low in-city gasoline mileage, 14.8 mpg, after six months and 3,500 miles. We would definitely buy another SEL Fusion again but probably the 160-horsepower I4 engine.Fully 95 percent of our mileage is stop-\\'n\\'-go, short hop, in-city driving. Even our 2000 Ford Focus station wagon, with a four-cylinder, 2.0-liter Zetec, only delivers 22-23 mpg under these same conditions.The Fusion is a fine mid-size sedan with a host of creature comforts and nice touches. The fit and finish -- inside and out -- is perfect, superb, couldn\\'t be any better. The car handles like it is glued to rails and the 221-horsepower Duratec V6 has ample power.We did a lot of Internet research before we bought the car but never actually test drove any of its competitors. That is probably not typical.  Has anyone driven this car or found any reviews on it as to how it drives, it seems like no magazines have tested this version. The 252HP 3.6L/6A seems to be the closest thing to what the new 08 V6 Chevy Malibu will drive like, since they are on identical platforms.  your projected specs seem quite possible to me as well. How those specs. would \\'devastate\\' the 268-270hp and 22/31-20/29 already available in the Camry and the Altima is a little far fetched.  was under the impression that the Malibu was going to be closer to the Aura XR (in top trims). Have driven the XR, and besides liking how it looked and a general improvement in the fit/finish dept (still below Camcords, IMO), I found the 3.6 to be an apparently very solid engine. Smooth, easily revved, quiet, and good power, of course - some Nissan-like torque steer, however.Pontiac has always favored the \\'sport\\' side of things so I\\'m not sure how the G6 is related to the XR or FTM the Malibu.  Maybe all mention of outside comments, articles and reviews should be banned. This way all of us are only voicing are opinion on the matter, there wouldn\\'t be any facts or outside authorities to lend some credence to the discussion.  I personally can\\'t stand CR, and some of their opinions are so laughable that I highly doubt there\\'s a car nut on their staff. I think there is no doubt that CR has its own motivations and priorities in evaluating a car - perhaps - safety, reliability, and economy, in no particular order.But, I also think that there is a very strong case to be made for the fact that CR (and its ratings) are likely the single most influential publication to the average car buyer. Given that and the fact that they are not beholden to anybody or anything for whatever \\'opinions\\' they do have, you are welcome to form your own opinions and/or have a different set of priorites - as I would bet they would tell you as well.  True, the guy that bought my 50 month old 65K mile \\'03 Accord Coupe V6 from me told his wife \"the car drives like it is brand new.\"Couldn\\'t of said it better myself to explain how the car holds up over time. Not just drives, but looks, feels, and sounds.  True... CR\\'s priorities are not all out performance and track speed. CR\\'s priorities lie in ease of use, overall design quality, build quality, reliability, safety, and fuel economy. Fuel Economy could carry over to show they do look at \"value\" and pricing to determine a \"good\" deal.Time is money, and frequent breakdowns and warranty visits cost both time and money (the gas you waste driving to the dealership every 2 months).  Those EPA ratings you listed for the Camry and Altima are the OLD EPA system. I said the NEW EPA mileage system, so take 10-15% off your numbers.  I think that we are rapidly approaching the limits (from a torque perspective) of FWD platforms although a few mfgrs like Honda (in the TL-S thru throttle programming) and Toyota (in both the Avalon and Camry thru tranny gear programming) have seemed to minimize the problem. I agree with you about the winter traction benefits of having 60% of your weight over the drive wheels, but also believe as we make an inevitable switch back to RWD designs that a mass driver retraining program might be needed - there are an awful lot of folks out on our roads that have never driven anything but a FWD car.  I don\\'t understand why everyone says CR slammed the Aura so bad. The score on MSN Auto\\'s Consumer Reports Link shows a score of 70 which falls squarely into the \"very good\" category. It is not a low score by any stretch of the imagination.It just isn\\'t up to the league of Accord, Camry, TL, Altima scores.  no you didn\\'t say \\'new\\' EPA but it is something that maybe I should have assummed given the effective date of the new EPA system. 280hp and what effectively would be something like 23/34 today would be an accomplishment - guess we\\'ll see because you are right the new Camry ratings should be in the 20/28 category.  True, the guy that bought my 50 month old 65K mile \\'03 Accord Coupe V6 from me told his wife \"the car drives like it is brand new.\" so will most cars if you take care of them. I have a 9 yr old nissan that looks and runs as well as the day I bought it. and it has 145k on it.  True... CR\\'s priorities are not all out performance and track speed. CR\\'s priorities lie in ease of use, overall design quality, build quality, reliability, safety, and fuel economy. Fuel Economy could carry over to show they do look at \"value\" and pricing to determine a \"good\" deal.I have no problem with their product evaluations on particular vehicles where they do a full report. I like that they measure leg room and cargo and towing capacity, although that information is on the manufacturer\\'s website :confuse: And I like how they run them into things at 5 mph to see how the bumpers hold up and what not; although that information is available from the IIHS :confuse: I like that they mention how requirements to install an infant or child seat. I like the subjective commentary on ease of use, although I like to evaluate on my own as well. I think the only thing I pretty much ignore is the survey responses for reliability and what not.  Maybe CR also understands that \\'value\\' may not have a whole lot to do with initial price. Think that you\\'ll have a difficult time finding any of these cars these days in the shop every 2 months! Things have improved substantially in that regard in recent years, so much so that reliability over even the first 100k is assumed. It\\'s the 2nd (or 3rd) 100k that separates the men from the boys, a number that very few of us that buy new cars will ever see.  I think the only thing I pretty much ignore is the survey responses for reliability and what not. that curious, being about the only thing (other than measured performance figures) that is NOT subjective.  actually, go back an read what I have written...when referring to something that does not exist yet, there will always be qualifiers. why? because I don\\'t know, and I won\\'t pretend to know more than I don\\'t.  Car and Driver were not as impressed with the Aura\\'s interior as some. I guess it depends on what you compare the interior to.\"As we said, almost right, until the sponges in GM&#146;s Cheapness Department got to the project. Although styled well, the interior is executed with hard plastic, glaring panel gaps, ragged mold lines, and the scrape-scraping of a gear selector that slides through its range like a screwdriver through sand. Have GM&#146;s cheapness freaks ever sat in an Accord?\" When you compare it to a real nice car, it comes up shy.  I agree totally with jd10013. Timely preventive maintenance, attention to detail, and lots of TLC will do wonders for extending life of a car. I have a 22 year old SAAB 900 that drives, and runs, the same as it did when I drove it off the SAAB dealer\\'s lot in April 1985. No squeaks, no clunks, and the car handles just as well as it did on Day 1.  until the sponges in GM&#146;s Cheapness Department got to the projectthe enthusiast mags do have a way with words don\\'t they? CR would say something like \\'ill fitting parts and pieces, and generally \\'subpar\\' fit and finish and probably wouldn\\'t mention the Accord at all. Have read the same thing about the Fusion interior referencing its use of 80\\'s vintage LED displays, an interior that I personally found agreeable and \\'un-Ford-like\\'. Regard this kind of thing in the same way as exterior styling - beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

No squeaks, no clunks, and the car handles just as well as it did on Day 1. The thing for me was, for the first 10 years or so I was driving, I was always in one POS after another. couldn\\'t afford 2 new cars, and the newest was always driven by my wife. As I got older, and more affluent, I was able to pay off my wifes car early and get another new one while her\\'s was in good shape, with low milage. Well, after 10yrs of driving crap, (and boy did I have some crappy cars) I realy appreciated having a new one, and took very good care of it. did all the required stuff right on time, washed every week or two, waxed 2-3 times a year, treated all the interior every couple months, and never allowed my kids to bring food or drinks in it. As a result, the car was in such good shape that when I bought my alti in feb, just couldn\\'t bear to trade my old one in. the car just ran and looked too good to sell.  personally, I like reading CR just like I like reading the opinions on this forum... much of it I disagree with, but I like getting the perspective of others, especially from those who know what they are talking about. it seems to me though when I read car and driver, motortrend, or autoweek (among others), I find that those articles have more detail and depth than CR. CR\\'s reviews seem to cover cars for non auto enthusiasts... all about practicality and how \"appliance\" like a car is. of course these things are important, but I find that car reviews in edmunds, for example (shameless plug :blush: ) much more well rounded and I get a better feel of where the car fits in it\\'s segment. if CR were to review a ferrari, I bet they would say that there wasn\\'t enough trunk space, the car was too loud, and the mpg weren\\'t as good as other \"sports\" cars. and the idea that just because CR does not take ads does not mean they are unbiased. everyone has their bias, and reputation will always play a role in developing opinions.  I actually saw my first 08 Taurus on my way home from work today in red. The new styling is an improvement and no-way can reviewers complain anylonger for vanilla styling.  Actually I agree 100% with what you posted. CR does have a bias and their bias is different than C&D bias, edmunds\\' bias etc.To me a most of supposed studies, statistics and reviews have no relevance when I buy a car. I don\\'t care how many awards JD Powers gives the manufacturer, if the car is COTY, how many black marks CR gives it or if CR says the trunk is too small. You never really know about the ownership experience until years after you buy the car and it\\'s a fact of life for lemons occur in every manufacturer. In general, I believe you get what you pay for. One mans no-frills stripper is another mans golden carriage.The only exception to the above comment is end of year clearance sales, where manufacturers provide incentives to move the cars. If one shops judiciously a good value can be had.  heard of a new 2.5 4cyl engine producing 170-180HP and about the same torque for the 09 Fusion? I am reading in other forums about this and noone has yet linked me to an article or review about this. More speculation? can anyone link me?  and the idea that just because CR does not take ads does not mean they are unbiased. everyone has their bias, and reputation will always play a role in developing opinions. At least CR\\'s biases are personal (like yours and mine), and not bought and paid for. CR treats car evaluation like Joe Friday, \"Just the facts maam\". The advertising mags seem to only get critical (less bias) when doing a comparison test. When they do an individual car review, it sounds like an endorsement, that\\'s been paid for.  \"I actually saw my first 08 Taurus on my way home from work today in red. The new styling is an improvement and no-way can reviewers complain anylonger for vanilla styling.\"Did you mean new name? This car has been out for what, three years.I wish them luck especially since I recently bought a lot of Ford stock at a real cheap rate. The Five Hundred, Taurus, or whatever they call it still looks odd to me. It\\'s bubble top needs to be chopped 1 or 2 inches to look nicer. I don\\'t think I could live with the looks as it is.  >At least CR\\'s biases are personal.. and not bought and paid for.I\\'ve always wondered about that because of their past reluctance to change as cars changed.  I hope so! The Aura is new for 2006. That Camry debuted more than five years ago.Not according to some people around here, that blindly think that a 8-year-old CamCord is still better than the brand-new \"American\" cars built today, without even stepping foot in any of them, or taking them out for test-drives.No grad, you\\'re not one of them...   60 hp or so will do that won\\'t it? Also a part of human nature - your coworker WANTS to rave about something she just paid all that money for, for her own gratifications (and ego) as well as those reassurances that might come from you when you nod approvingly. Considering how she drives, HP has nothing to do with it. She WANTS to brag because she test-drove everything else out there, including the new Camry, and feels she made the right choice because SHE loved it more than the Camry.She doesn\\'t care about my approval (or anyone else, for that matter). In fact, when she started her search a few months ago, I recommended the Camry and Altima to her. Apparently, her husband was pulling for the Camry as well, but she did her own thing, and bought what SHE liked. And after having sat and rode in one, I agree that she made the right decision, and I too like the Aura very much as well.Egos have nothing to do with it, unless one\\'s not very confident in their own.  Did you mean new name? This car has been out for what, three years. Check his post again. I don\\'t see anything else mentioned but the new styling, which indeed is new for \\'08, as well as the 3.5L and a new name.I wish them luck especially since I recently bought a lot of Ford stock at a real cheap rate. The Five Hundred, Taurus, or whatever they call it still looks odd to me. It\\'s bubble top needs to be chopped 1 or 2 inches to look nicer. I don\\'t think I could live with the looks as it is.And who\\'s fault is it that you bought stock in a company in which you find the styling of it\\'s products \"odd\"? I\\'m sure I can speak for everyone else here when I say that that last thing I\\'d do is invest in a company who\\'s in dire straits and whose product I\\'m not particularly fond of.  I hope so! The Aura is new for 2006. Grad, is that a typo? I thought the Aura was new this year, 2007.  \"Egos have nothing to do with it, unless one\\'s not very confident in their own.\"I would also drive the Saturn over the Camry any day. The Camry is an old peoples car.  \"Check his post again. I don\\'t see anything else mentioned but the new styling, which indeed is new for \\'08, as well as the 3.5L and a new name.\"That new styling, looks like the same car from 3-years-ago other than new headlights and a grill on it, big deal. The rest of the car is the same. What about the bubble top roof?\"And who\\'s fault is it that you bought stock in a company in which you find the styling of it\\'s products \"odd\"?\" I don\\'t see a fault in supporting a company with a funny looking car when there are other vehicles in their line-up that show some promise including the upcoming F series trucks. My hopes an aspirations are not banked on that silly looking Five Hundred/err Tuarus. The stock was cheap because of the poor direction of the company and products. They can only get better but I don\\'t think this car Taurus/500 is the answer, but maybe they will find buyers? That will be a bonus to me and my bottom line. People who buy stock and have a diversified portfolio don\\'t necessarily have to believe or like everything about company they invest in as long as it shows profit/potential. If you have a diversified portfolio (15 + different companies) do you really know all the products they produce and use them?  The designer of the previous generation VW Passat designed the Five Hundred, now Taurus. You should see a distinct family resemblance. Not everyone wants vertically-challenged side windows like the Chrysler 300, and many new cars, including the Aura.  Does anyone know:Who was the first to put five blades on their Fusion, Gillette or Ford?The Fusion was out first... or was it the Fusion? I can\\'t remember, anyways besides having the same name, they do kinda look alike to me.  Thank you for that; things were too serious. I wonder if there was patent infringement there.   AFAIK, you are correct, 2007 it is.  According to Nissannews.com All 08 Altima sedans add the following over 2007 models.Standard ABS on 2.5 modelsStandard splash guardsAvailable Xm radio on all trim levels.I am happy that the once hard to find ABS will now be standard...took Nissan long enough.  Standard ABS on 2.5 modelsStandard splash guardsAvailable Xm radio on all trim levels.I am happy that the once hard to find ABS will now be standard...took Nissan long enough.Yeah I agree, that makes it go back on the shopping list. And splash guards make my heart go pitter patter.  Ah. I think I know what happened in my weary brain - The only comparison test I\\'ve read of the Aura put it up against five other competitors, one of which included an Accord SE, that\\'s very similar to my Accord EX (which is a 2006). In my head, it was 2006 vs. 2006. These days, no cars \"debut\" in the model year in which they are designated. Look at the Camry. It has been out for what, 15 months, ALL of which are 2007 models! Thanks for the correction though.   Available Xm radio on all trim levels.XM is a beautiful thing. I have it in my car, but not in my wife\\'s. When we\\'re in her car listening to the radio, it feels so ancient.  Is there no limit on how early a company can start selling a car designated for the next model year? I don\\'t think you should be able to sell a car before 7/06, and call it an 07 model.  IIRC, the gov\\'t says that manufacturers are allowed to start selling upcoming models beginning January 1 of the year before the model year designation. The reason for this has to do with EPA emissions and mileage ratings. So after January 1, 2007 a new model can be called a 2008 model year vehicle if the manufacturer so desires. Some manufacturers also do this so that they can have extended sales periods of vehicles to make their sales volume appear higher. Then again, I might not be remembering it correctly. This old brain ain\\'t what it used to be!    Some manufacturers also do this so that they can have extended sales periods of vehicles to make their sales volume appear higher. Exactly, and it also makes the car seem newer than it actually is. We are only halfway through 07, and some 07 Camry\\'s are more than a year old.  The following is from Wikipedia:The model year of a product is a number used to describe approximately when a product was produced. However, the model year and the actual year of production don\\'t always coincide.AutomobilesIn the United States, automobile model years traditionally start in the third quarter of the preceding year. In other cases products of a previous model year can continue production, especially if a newer model hasn\\'t yet been released. In that case, the model year remains the same until a new model is introduced. This is to ensure that the model will be seen by the public and will actually sell an amount of vehicles before a new vehicle model is produced and people will look at the newer model rather than the previous one.In the United States, for regulation purposes, government authorities allow cars of a given model year to be sold starting on January 2 of the previous calendar year.  SO very true!!! Initial satisfaction surveys suffer from the strongest influences in human nature, ego and the desire to have spent your money well. The complete lemon I bought in the mid-Nineties.... actually received good reviews from even me..... initially! It took a few repair bills and tow trucks to turn on the lights on what had just happened.  I LOVE the fact that CR is the only review source that would criticize a new Ferrari for lack of trunk space, running too loudly, and not getting enough MPG!That is the essence of fair, consistent reviews, across the board, no matter what the price.The ultimate \"perfect\" car would have decent trunk space, get great MPG, and if it is loud, would be a \"pleasing\" sound, and only mainly when your accelerating quickly, not just loud and annoyous at idle. CR does look at the fact that \"30 MPG is excellent for a powerful V6, vs. 40 MPG being excellent for a 4 banger.\" But all in all, even a 400 HP supercar should get good mileage in a perfect world.  She might be happy with her Aura right now.... maybe even for a period of 3 years. But watch out when that warranty expires and the car goes to hell in typical domestic fashion. WATCH OUT!!!Ask her how she likes her Aura at 60,000 miles!   :sick: >maybe even for a period of 3 years. But watch out when that warranty expires and the car goes to hell in typical domestic fashion. The warranty is 100,000 miles. :blush:  :surprise: Such a broad brush. Maybe off topic but I\\'ll bite. I\\'ve been amazed at the assumptions made by people who haven\\'t owned a domestic car in the 90s and later who try to make them seem unreliable. Perhaps that\\'s better saved for some of the foreign brands riding on their reputation who have had problems with their redesigns in the last few years. Overall I agree with a post in some discussion I saw recently that if you take good care of a domestic just the way some take good care of the foreign product and you\\'ll get the same results. If you don\\'t take good care of the oil changes and maintenance schedule with a foreign brand you\\'ll get the same result as you get when you don\\'t take care of the domestic. I saw a Honda Accord knocking it\\'s way home that was a few years old. I saw a wrecker dragging it away a few days later. The lady probably didn\\'t take care of it--it was a model before 03 but I don\\'t know the exact year but it was less than 10 years old. :confuse:  That is the essence of fair, consistent reviews, across the board, no matter what the price. No, that\\'s the essence of rating vehicles like appliances. Cars generate emotions and a Ferrari should not be rated using the same criteria as a Honda Accord. Two completely different products for two completely different purposes.  100,000 mile warranty from GM only applies to about 5 items. A vehicle has about ..... thousands of items?  True... but since I\\'m not a multi-millionaire, and like sports cars, I want a CT-type review of sports cars so I know how they\\'ll do as \"daily drivers.\" In addition to weekend spirited drives.  It\\'s called the powertrain - you know, the engine and transmission, transfer cases, differentials, axles, wheel bearings, etc. That is at least a few hundred \"items\" and represents the 2 most expensive repairs on a vehicle - engine and transmission replacement. Most of the other \"thousands\" of items are cheap to replace by comparison.You obviously don\\'t own any late model (last 3 years) domestic vehicle. This isn\\'t 1990 anymore.  I second that - I sure would rather have a 100K warranty covering the powertrain & transmission than I would one that covers the $100-200 items. Having used my power train warranty once, to cover the power control module ($1200), it is indeed a big deal.Powertrain = stuff that makes the car go. A lot of the other stuff on any car just plain old wears out.kirstie_hvisiting host  but since I\\'m not a multi-millionaire, and like sports cars, I want a CT-type review of sports cars so I know how they\\'ll do as \"daily drivers.\" In addition to weekend spirited drives. I can see that being useful for something like a sporty mid-sized coupe or the like but not a Ferrari or others like it. The latter is in no way, shape or form built to be a daily driver. The guys in Modena would take your car away if they knew you used it for that. :P  I think you summed it up pretty well. some people seem to be stuck in the 90\\'s. Now I\\'ll admit that I won\\'t buy domestic anymore (could change in the future of course)but it\\'s not because of reliability. Ford, GM, build cars that will hold up as well as anything comming out of asia. they may average an extra problem or two, but a very, very small difference compared to 15 yrs ago.  I only average about 7K miles per year. So Hyundai\\'s TEN YEAR/100K is more valuable to me than GM\\'s FIVE YEAR/100K warranty. Anyone who averages less than 20K per year gets a longer power train warranty from Hyundai than GM offers.  Lol....Kristie...ur a hoot....i luv ur comentaries...especially ur definition of Powertrain.....\"stuff that maes your car go \"....lol keep up the good work  BTW....most car companys wont change the model year before April 1st....Not january...Anything after Aprail 1st will usually get the next model years designation......  Glad you like my \"work.\" I am NOT super-saavy when it comes to vehicles, but I know what makes sense for me (not everybody, for me), and a long powertrain warranty makes my eyes light up in the same way that Tim Robbins in Shawshank Redemption does. I am not a real GM fan, but strategically, I do feel that the extended warranty is a good business move for them. If they could just make a convertible that I like (read: not Solstice), we\\'d be talking.kirstie_h(really) visiting host  Sometimes, sometimes not. Some manufacturers, Kia comes to mind, like to play the \"halfsies\" game, e.g. the all-new 2006.5 Optima (did the same thing when the Spectra was redesigned a few years ago). But it\\'s getting more common to introduce a car very early in the year and slap the next year on it. Toyota has done this multiple times in recent years; Chrysler has done it; probably others I\\'m not remembering right now. I guess there\\'s multiple reasons for this, including people seem to want the latest and greatest, but also it may save automakers money because they get almost two years out of one model year--assuming they shift to fall intros for subsequent years (not always the case, e.g. Hyundai has been starting new model years for the Sonata in spring since the \\'06 debuted in the U.S. in spring of 2005).  Lest we forget in all the talk about the new Accord, there will be renewed competition from Hyundai next spring with the 2009 Sonata. The first pics are out, and reveal a Genesis-inspired snout, revised rear (hard to make out just how revised), and a new interior with Veracruz-esque dash. There are also reports of a second-generation 3.3L V6 for more power.http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=121485  Maybe the 2009 Sonata will be better received than the current generation. Sales have been way off on the Sonata considering the accolades and predictions.Maybe a diesel version?  I have to admit, the new Accord has definitely grown on me. I think it looks much better than the current generation, the front and side profile is executed much better. Not sure about the rear though, too much emphasis on the 5-series. Generally speaking it looks good but for some reason it doesn\\'t strike me as a Honda.Here are the pictures:Source:Jalopnik  that\\'s pretty quick for Hyundai to be redoing the Sonata... I am surprised it\\'s not doing too well since I think it is a great value. Granted, it\\'s not a car that I found too appealing for my tastes during the few days I had it as a rental, but I was impressed at the build quality and the powertrain (except for manumatic downshifts that took way too long). In the end, I think it shows how much of a stranglehold Honda and Toyota has on this segment when a good quality car that is aimed at the same type of consumer that sells for several thousands less is overlooked so often. Even with Hyundai getting good press lately for reliability and solid build quality, they still have a long way to go before people forget or forgive them for making the shoddy cars of 15 years ago. I think Hyundai is making a good move in trying to make the car visually more appealing and distinct; they need more than a \"me too\" ad campaign to succeed given the bad rep baggage they carry along. For the Sonata to do well, I think they need a car that says, \"I deserve to be looked at as a solid car and don\\'t need to be compared to others to be chosen.\" Most of the characteristics of the Sonata are very good; it shouldn\\'t take much for them to start doing really well.  Of all the angles, the front 3/4 view of the Accord is by far the best; it looks pretty good from that angle. But I still think the side profile has no flow and the rear 3/4 view has that strange headlight bubble and the back is just ugly. I\\'m surprised their leaking such complete views so early... Honda must be low on current model inventory and are just trying to slow sales of other manufacturers models until they can get the new Accord onto lots.Anybody feeling the chrome handles? Yuck if you ask me...  Three years is the typical timeframe for a mid-gen redux for Hyundai. The Gen 3 Sonata had a similar facelift after three years, with both the front and rear being restyled for 2002.As for needing to be so good it doesn\\'t need to be compared to other cars... I don\\'t think any brand of mid-sized car is at that point, or will be anytime soon. It\\'s a very competitive market.  After seeing these clear photos from all sides, my thoughts are...* Oh, look how they took the taillamps off the Sonata but didn\\'t take the part that extends onto the trunk lid.* The roofline is a dead ringer for the Optima (and many other cars too, but in this class, mostly the Optima).* The side character line looks Acura-esque--I wonder if that\\'s because in some markets, the car will be sold as an Acura?* The door handles, especially the chrome ones, look too big for the car.* The grille is really, really ugly. Hideous, IMO. I\\'m not sure why Honda would put a grille like that on an otherwise sleek-looking car. It looks very un-Hondalike, except maybe the Ridgeline. It reminds me of something Suzuki might do, or Subaru before they came to their senses.  I\\'m glad you\\'ve had such good luck with Accords. The one I had turned into a bottomless money pit at 20K. You\\'ll have a really hard time convincing me to buy another one.Regards:OldCEM  You obviously don\\'t own any late model (last 3 years) domestic vehicle. This isn\\'t 1990 anymore.Some of you are making it sound like domestic vehicles have done a complete 180... however, my 2004 was a different story, requiring a shop visit every few months of ownership, starting from day three:-Brand new, there was a whining noise from rear end at 15-20 mph (changed pitch as speed increased) in either 1st or 2nd gear; selling dealer stated problem could not be duplicated. The noise didn\\'t worsen, although TSB&#146;s were issued for improper fluid in rear diffs, which were known to fail.-Rear passenger door wouldn&#146;t open from inside at time of purchase; repaired under warranty.-When cruising at low RPM&#146;s, a sudden lift of the throttle (such as to switch to the brake in slowing traffic) would occasionally cause an extremely harsh bang and jolt from the transmission (the first time this happened I thought I had run something over). This problem faded somewhat after the manufacturer \"fix\" (see below) and seemed to improve with time and mileage, however it was still present after the transmission flush at around 40k miles.-Hesitation shifting from park to drive, or drive to reverse (as in 3-pt turn), requiring use of throttle and followed by a very harsh engagement; a transmission solenoid was replaced and a transmission fluid additive was added to fix (all under warranty).-Squeaky front suspension; very noticeable when driving over speed bumps; front suspension bushings replaced under warranty.-Brake rotors rusted heavily around 15,000 miles, causing vibration when braking from high speeds; fixed under warranty (new pads, rotors turned); problem resurfaced and became more pronounced less than 4,000 miles later.-Around 15,000 miles, humming noise from rear at 60-70 mph regardless of gear; only present when throttle open.-&#147;Hooting&#148; noise from A/C around 2,000 RPMs; evidently common according to dealer.-Rear ABS sensor failed -just- out of warranty, requiring a $60 part plus labor to install.-Brakes were shot (again...) at 42k miles. Evidently the rotors would go first, then eat the pads...-Lever to fold second row passenger seat had stopped actuating the internal release by trade-in (seat would not fold).Funny thing was, on the Edmunds \"problems and solutions\" board, there were many people having these same problems, but we were all irritated mainly because our dealers acted like nothing was wrong... What good is a warranty if the manufacturer constantly denies there is a problem and won\\'t honor it?  Honda and Toyota have the best 4 cylinder\\'s in the business, and therefore many opt for that engine choice. Hmmm...I thought they had the best V6, too...so why is that not what people opt for?Ford doesn\\'t have a viable or decent 4 cylinder, so everyone gets the \"somewhat decent\" V6.That is a pretty extreme opinion. Are there any facts behind it? I\\'d like to know what specifically is unviable and indecent about the Ford/Mazda I4? Mine seems pretty viable and decent to me.I think reality is that there is less difference between the I4s than there is between the V6s.  There was a recent vehicle that debuted on Jan. 2 with the next year\\'s designation, but I can\\'t remember which one.  Anybody feeling the chrome handles? Yuck if you ask me... Agree, but I would pretty much say that about any and all chrome on any car  .I do think the new Accord is a big improvement appearance-wise, though. I too think it looks best in the front 3/4 view. Lose the chrome door handles on the gray one and it\\'s not bad (the gray makes the other chrome less noticable).  At least at Ford the turnaround started with new models introduced after the 2005 model year. Fusion and Milan are equal to or better than the Camcords right now (even by CR standards) and that is almost a 180 from the 10 yr old Taurus. The new 500 (now Taurus), Explorer, Mustang, F150 have all proven much more reliable than previous models. Even the Focus is now a CR recommended buy after all the initial recall problems. Ford at least has made a significant process change in how they design and build vehicles and while I wouldn\\'t call it a 180 it\\'s at least a 135. The launch of the Edge and MKX was delayed almost a month because Ford requires the plant to run for 5 straight days without a single assembly defect. Several times they got to 3 or 4 days and had to start over. But they made it.Yes, the dealer network is still a problem and the manufacturers unfortunately don\\'t have much control over that. Not directly at least.  Most people have good luck with Hondas. People do not generally say their Accord was a dud, but it happens. No manufacturer is immune from a lemon. But I feel the same way about Ford and Nissan. Would really have a hard time convincing me to buy another one.  \"Fusion and Milan are equal to or better than the Camcords right now (even by CR standards\"CR may think so, the buying public doesn\\'t think so and neither do I. The Fusion has a long way to go before it becomes equal or better to a Camry or Accord. Not that it\\'s a bad car, it\\'s just that the Camry and Accord are that much better. The 2008 Accord will raise the bar even more, you can bet on it.  I was referring to quality and it wouldn\\'t matter if the Fusion was twice as good as the Camcords in every possible category - they aren\\'t going to win over Camcord loyalists overnight. There are way too many satisfied Camcord owners who won\\'t switch until they encounter a problem or another vehicle comes out with some feature they decide they need.And the 2009 Fusion will also raise the bar with an upgraded interior (see the Ford Flex for an idea of the new interior design), hybrid model, twin turbo direct injection 2.5L I4 and exterior styling that looks better than the 08 Accord (to me).  hybrid modelThis one I believe.twin turbo direct injection 2.5L I4 Source please. What\\'s Ford trying to do? Make a Fordspeed Fusion? :P exterior styling that looks better than the 08 Accord (to me).Pointless statement. First of all, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Second, if styling is really that important of a factor then IMO, Sonata, Aura and Fusion should be outselling the Camry/Accord by now.Also, I am with those satisfied Camcord owners. I just don\\'t see the point of messing with successful and proven purchasing decisions.  When Sonata....fusion///milan...etc. start to produce cars that go 300k miles...fairly trouble free like Cam-Cord....then you\\'ll start to see them outsell..( if they keep their prices down) Also...IMO...the4 diesels will start taking over completely once they get a consistant 45mpg.  Also, I am with those satisfied Camcord owners. I just don\\'t see the point of messing with successful and proven purchasing decisions. But some people want something different and you have to understand that. If you ask me the Sonata is the one, that if done better, threatens to outsell the CamCord because it is a bit more vanilla than a Fusion, Altima, Mazda6, etc. Those latter cars are more niche fillers if nothing else because they are edgier and have different personalities. They stand out in one or two categories whereas the CamCords don\\'t really stand out in any specific categories and do everything rather well. The Ford F-150 and Explorer were always noted as being like that in MT which supposedly explained their appeal to the masses. Makes sense to me.   Don\\'t think this was mentioned here but there are some changes for the 2008 Fusion. Most notable are standard ABS and the new sport package which includes 18\" wheels, a black chrome grille, and a sport tuned suspension. I\\'m trying to find some pics of the new wheels and grille but am not having any luck so far.  It sounds like the Hybrid Fusions might be available next spring as opposed to next fall. I guess we\\'ll find out at LA or Detroit auto shows.As to the Twin Force I4 2.5L direct injection this has been hinted at by Derrick Kuzak and confirmed by an inside source. Power output is rumored to be 260 hp but with I4 fuel economy. A DSG type transmission called Powershift is also in the works but not confirmed for the Fusion.  When Sonata....fusion///milan...etc. start to produce cars that go 300k miles...fairly trouble free like Cam-Cord....then you\\'ll start to see them outsell.Oh please - most people don\\'t keep cars more than 5 or 6 years at the most and I bet you can count the number of 300K camcords on two hands. 150K is a more reasonable target and there is no reason to believe any of the current mid-size sedans won\\'t go 150K without major problems. It\\'s not 1990 anymore.  How many people do you know drive a car for 30k miles a year for at least 10 years? Not many I know of. Average miles on a car these days is around 12k a year. I drive a lot less than that. In the Rust Belt, ten years is a long time to own a car and still have it rust-free. (Come to think of it though, the only car I ever owned that showed rust after only five years was a Honda--a Civic.) If you peruse the Hyundai ownership discussions here, you\\'ll see many reports from owners with over 100k reliable miles on their Hyundais over 5-7 years. That\\'s enough to build a reputation for long-term reliability, IMO.But Sonata outsell CamCord? Not anytime soon. Hyundai currently has neither the manufacturing capacity or dealer network to come anywhere close to Accord or Camry in sales volume. Their current production in Alabama is limited to 300k a year right now--and that must be shared with the Santa Fe, for which sales are surging. So if Hyundai increases sales of the Sonata from the current 12k or so to about 15k a month, that will max out capacity in Alabama if they do 10k Santa Fes a month. Then they have to find excess capacity overseas or expand the Alabama plant.  Sales have been way off on the Sonata considering the accolades and predictions.Sales numbers would indicate that this is a true statement. Anyone have any theories as to why this is the case? Did the Ford Fusion steal its sales from the Sonata? Did some other model? Why would a car with such good reviews not sell as well as expected? It seems to be a mystery.  Some people just don\\'t want to buy a Hyundai regardless of the product itself. I admit I\\'m one of them but I wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend it to someone else. The Fusion probably stole a few Sonata sales but not that many. It\\'s probably a combination of several factors including advertising.  Did Fusion take away a few potential sales? Likely. There are cross-shopping all over the midsize segment so potential takeaways are likely for every car out there.Here is one of the reasons for the fall:Hyundai started a program to get \"as many butts into the Sonata as possible\". They sent a great number of units into fleet in 2006 in hopes for improved brand recognition.The sales dip is reported by way of year-over-year (YOY) (e.g. June 2007 vs. June 2006). Of course, comparing the normal amount sold in 2007, and the large amount of units reported last year (2006), including the ones sent via the fleet program, would be a skewed comparison. I don\\'t think it\\'d be surprising to see sales dip throughout the rest of this year using the YOY comparison.The previous generation barely made 10K/month during its cycle, while the current Sonata has made that number stand up.The other issue, as stated by backy, capacity restraint at the Alab. plant. Also, the demand for I4 were higher than Hyundai officials estimated.  I have to admit, the new Accord has definitely grown on me.Louiswei, those are the best photos I have seen of the 2008 and my initial reaction is just the opposite of yours: I like the looks of the 2007s better. Different strokes for different folks, I guess.Not sure about the rear though, too much emphasis on the 5-series. Generally speaking it looks good but for some reason it doesn\\'t strike me as a Honda.What is a \"5-series?\" Forgive my ignorance. I did have a similar reaction: That it doesn\\'t remind me of a Honda much. But I don\\'t know if that is a good or bad thing. Styling-wise, most of the Asian cars have a plain-Jane, lookalikeness to them, not very distinctive. Maybe the designs are too subtle for me to appreciate.The Accords, Camrys, Sonatas, Kias, Subarus et al all look generic to me, even the Auras. That\\'s one of the reasons why my wife and I chose a 2007 Fusion: Distinctive styling; it doesn\\'t get mistaken for anything else. We consider that to be a plus but not everyone would, of course.  Most of the national incentives for Nissans endend July 2, 2007 according to their website. Anyone know of the current incentives yet? The Murano specifically...  5-series - BMW. 528i, 530i, 545i, M5, etc.  Anybody feeling the chrome handles? Yuck if you ask me...A minor point, to be sure, but that was my first reaction, too.  Not a very good report card, BenderofBows. What make and model car?  twin turbo direct injection 2.5L I4 Source please. What\\'s Ford trying to do? Make a Fordspeed Fusion?Here is a small byte on it. More detailed info is available on some subscription site called autonews.com apparently but I don\\'t have access to it.  If you ask me the Sonata is the one, that if done better, threatens to outsell the CamCord because it is a bit more vanilla than a Fusion, Altima, Mazda6, etc\"if done better\" ? It\\'s hard to resist.....but...duh!The Sonata over the Altima? I think Altima\\'s HUGE sales lead over the Sonata is in no jeopardy.  The other issue, as stated by backy, capacity restraint at the Alab. plant. Also, the demand for I4 were higher than Hyundai officials estimated.You make it sound like there are NO Sonatas sitting on dealers\\' lots beacause every one they make is being snatched up quickly, and they can\\'t make enough of them.Not.  \"if done better\" ? It\\'s hard to resist.....but...duh! The Sonata over the Altima? I think Altima\\'s HUGE sales lead over the Sonata is in no jeopardy. You\\'re missing my point. I\\'m saying the Fusion, Altima, Mazda6, and others like them would never outsell the Camry or Accord because they are not nearly as mainstream and offer a more sporting experience overall. The Sonata seems to be the more mainstream car but it needs to be better to pose a threat. No matter how much better you make the others they just won\\'t appeal to everyone.  When Sonata....fusion///milan...etc. start to produce cars that go 300k miles...fairly trouble free like Cam-Cord...So now the claims are for 300K trouble free miles...give me a break, that is not happening with any brand of car on any kind of regular basis.  I have a hard time living with a vehicle for 30k miles let alone 300k!!! Of course it takes us a good 4 years to reach 30k.  urnews, that \"not very good report card\" was earned by a $30,000 Ford Explorer. I expected much more for that kind of money. The previous generation Explorers were solid, dependable trucks, but after the 2002 redesign they had widespread quality issues through at least 2004, most of which didn\\'t show up on the \"initial quality\" studies.Coming off of that experience, I had trouble seriously considering a less expensive Ford sedan, or any Ford for that matter. The biggest slap in the face was being able to go online and look up the TSBs that specifically detailed my problems, but not being able to get any of the dealers to help me out. Even more, the \"fixes\" suggested by Ford were just band-aids. You read the description of my problems. Fluid additives? C\\'mon, Ford.This was 2004. I expected my new cars transmission to shift smoothly, my brake rotors to last more than 15,000 miles, and my engine to crank on the first try, every time. Ford didn\\'t deliver that for me. It would be hard to give them another shot.  but not being able to get any of the dealers to help me out. Even more, the \"fixes\" suggested by Ford were just band-aids. You read the description of my problems. Fluid additives? C\\'mon, FordA friend of mine had a 2004 Explorer V8 that had tranny problems so I see where you are coming from. He dumped it for a loaded \\'04 TrailBlazer. OTOH, I have an \\'06 Explorer V6 which has been flawless for the 13k miles we\\'ve used it. It is a different tranny than those past models though.  You obviously don\\'t own any late model (last 3 years) domestic vehicle. This isn\\'t 1990 anymore. If you change that statement to it isn\\'t 2000 anymore, I\\'ll buy it. Otherwise I\\'m not buying your sales pitch.I had a 1995 domestic for one.... and have driven a few rental fodder vehicles up to 2003, for two!  Actually, it might be kinda fun driving a Ferrari around as a daily driver.   akirby - it strikes me that you must work for and/or supervise Ford\\'s \\'rumor mill\\' marketing department a seemingly never ending series of unkept and/or late arriving \\'promises\\'. Ford NEEDS to actually do something - not talk about it!  Stuff that makes the car go is all covered in powertrain warranty?I seriously wonder if batteries, alternator, serpentine, and timing belts are covered. I wonder if the starter cables, ignition, and other wires are covered. If you can\\'t start you can\\'t go. If your battery dies because the alternator isn\\'t charging the electrical system will die and the car will die on the road while running (at least it did in my domestic) How about the brakes, hard to go if you can\\'t stop safely. Is it okay to \"go\" if your gas tank is leaking because of a bad O-ring? You can \"GO\" without an AC, but it\\'s HOT in CA, goodluck with that! Also, an A/C repair could cost close to just as much as a transmission replacement, potentially. There are lots of EXPENSIVE repairs and \"have to have in order to go\" items not covered in the powertrain I believe.  I\\'m not going to get into a battle, because that\\'s completely pointless. I\\'m simply going to state the blindingly obvious: many of those are wear-and-tear items and can deteriorate at different rates depending on driver/road conditions, and manufacturers would be foolish to warrant such items (and would soon go broke doing so).We get that you don\\'t like & don\\'t want to buy domestic vehicles. Domestic vehicle vs import vehicle quality is not the topic of this discussion, so we need to move on.  Actually, it might be kinda fun driving a Ferrari around as a daily driver.I totally agree but it\\'s not realistic unfortunately. :sick: A 500 HP V8 in one of these cars along with AWD would be really cool too.   My statement wasn\\'t about imports or domestics in general, but more specifically that a 100K powertrain warranty with 3 years bumper to bumper is still only marginally better than a 4 year bumper to bumper with 50K powertrain.Yes, many of the items I mentioned are wear and tear items. But they shouldn\\'t wear or tear on year 3 and one day! Nor mile 36,101. Would anyone argue that all warranties shouldn\\'t be AT LEAST 4 years and 50K \"bumper to bumper.\" I realize that bumper to bumper is not longer the same as it might of been 15 years ago, with exclusions galore in the fine print, but still, most everything I mentioned should last at least long enough to outlive the warranty.  You\\'re forgetting that the unkept promises of the past were under totally different management (pre-Fields and Mulally). In the past Ford would publicly announce things and then not deliver or deliver late. They\\'re now much more tight lipped about new technology (publicly) these days and all this info is coming from inside sources. I think they\\'ve learned to under promise and over achieve.  So by your logic Honda should offer a 300,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty? Last time I checked Honda was still 3/36 B2B.My issue with GMs powertrain warranty is that for most drivers it is only a 5 yr/70K mile warranty because they don\\'t drive more than 12K miles/yr.And you\\'re forgetting that it would take MULTIPLE failures of non-powertrain components to equal ONE powertrain failure from a cost perspective.  And, your point is off-topic - we are focusing specifically on discussion and questions about midsize sedans and not on manufacturer quality in general, or manufacturers\\' warranty programs. Please review the list of vehicles mentioned in the discussion header to help keep conversation on-track.  manufacturers would be foolish to warrant such items (and would soon go broke doing so)manufacturers obviously do these kind of things to represent a quality and/or faith in their own products and mostly because they HAVE TO as a function of sales. It was, after all, the Koreans that effectively started this kind of thing in an attempt to \\'live down\\' some rather questionable products sold not that many years ago. The consumer, in turn, perceives a level of quality that may or may not be there. As far as \\'going broke\\', be careful of what you wish for, these long term warranties have no value if there is no company left to stand behind it. Given Cerebus\\' apparent (and rumored) plans to sell off Chrysler in pieces, how much exactly do you suppose their warranties are worth?  I\\'m sure that Ford and Hyundai are both making great strides in quality when it comes to their midsize sedan offerings. The intital quality reports sure seem to bear that out. However, I for one won\\'t be convinced until 2012, when I can check the long-term reliability ratings of the 2006 Sonata and Fusion. If they are still rated as good as Honda and Toyota vehicles of the same vintage, then I\\'ll certainly consider whatever midsize sedans Hyundia and Ford are offering in 2012, so long as they are still receiving high \"initial quality\" ratings.  I think they\\'ve learned to under promise and over achieve. Being a \"Ford guy\" myself I see exactly where you are coming from ackirby. However, the general consumer needs a lot of convincing to go back to a domestic vehicle at this point. That is where the real challenge lies. The Accord and Camry are still very well executed products and all the others really need to show the Honda and Toyota faithful that they need to try the other guys too. The recent good press will help but it ain\\'t gonna work on its own. And I have yet to see anything from the big three, marketing wise, that would make me say WOW I gotta have one of those! So maybe leaking this info will help too but they do need to deliver while it\\'s still on people\\'s minds and that doesn\\'t leave a whole lot of time between leak and release.  If they are still rated as good as Honda and Toyota vehicles of the same vintage, then I\\'ll certainly consider whatever midsize sedans Hyundia and Ford are offering in 2012, so long as they are still receiving high \"initial quality\" ratings. So what would you buy now? The Accord isn\\'t tops at CR or J.D. anymore IIRC. It is still high in the ratings but don\\'t you want the best? :P  Folks like the editors of Edmunds.com disagree with you on that one. They have multiple Hyundais as their \"Most Wanted\" for 2007.Also, the facts disagree with you. Take a look for example at the EPA charts--Sonata is #1 in its EPA class. Elantra (considered by EPA a mid-sized car) is near the top of its EPA class.You also forgot some categories that are important for mid-sized sedan buyers--not everyone is focused on power, for example. The Sonata has class-leading standard safety equipment. Important for many people. I think it may also be tops in this class in interior room--also important for many people. Also tops (tied with Optima and Galant) for warranty coverage--important for many people.  Coming off of that experience, I had trouble seriously considering a less expensive Ford sedan, or any Ford for that matter.Bender, what\\'s the old investment saying, \"Past experience is no guarantee of future performance?\" Even so, given your experiences with the Explorer, I, too, would be leery of Ford products.Our experience with past and present Ford products has been quite good for the most part -- a fuel pump here, an alternator there, regular maintenance items, brakes, batteries, tires (but no abnormal wear).We now have an exceptional Ford, Lincoln, Mercury dealer in town, Sherwood of Salisbury (Md.) and that played a big part in our decision to buy a new 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion from them. Many times a car or truck is only going to be as good as the dealer that backs it up. Apparently, you had a problem in that area as well, unfortunately for both you and the FoMoCo.Previous bad experiences often tip the scale when it comes time to purchase a car, either new or previously owned. The fine track record for Accords and Camrys serves their manufacturers well and is a huge contributing factor to their continued position as sales leaders in the mid-size sedan segment.It\\'s highly unlikely that any of the other manufacturers will overtake Accord and Camry unless Honda and Toyota really screw something up, especially in the power train department.Although styling, handling are important, the most crucial factor of vehicle ownership may well be reliability. Except for poor in-city mileage, 14.8 mpg, our Fusion has been perfect for seven months and its first 3,700 miles. Yes, I\\'m knocking on wood.Will it be that way at 37,000 miles or 107,000 miles? No one knows but the longest journey begins with a single step.  ...and folks, here is your moment of Zen.No one knows but the longest journey begins with a single step. -thene   I was referring to quality and it wouldn\\'t matter if the Fusion was twice as good as the Camcords in every possible category - they aren\\'t going to win over Camcord loyalists overnight. Actually, Ford would win loyalists overnight from all manufacturers if they were able to be TWICE as good! Let\\'s look at what twice as good as an Accord would be... (A 5 year old design by the way).488 HP and 430 lb/ft of torque while getting 40/60 mpg, oh yeah baby! :P A warranty of 6 years or 72K miles, with a powertrain warranty of 8 years and 120K miles! Oh yes, more please! A price tag half that of the Accord... so I should be able to get a top of the line Fusion for around $14K out the door! I\\'m buying!   Quality is in the eyes of the beholder. While I don\\'t see the Fusion as non-quality, it doesn\\'t match up to Camry or Accord. (IMHO, and I guess a lot of \"CamCord\" buyers agree)  You make it sound like there are NO Sonatas sitting on dealers\\' lots beacause every one they make is being snatched up quickly, and they can\\'t make enough of them.Not.Where did I ever say that? You\\'re twisting my words. What I said were facts - capacity constraints and higher demand of I4s. Confirm with Hyundai if you\\'d like.The latest June sales report the Sonata up 28% so looks like they are making up the 4 cylinder shortage.  I purchased a 1992 Civic at 166K miles and took it to 200K, and it ran just fine. My friend had an early nineties Accord with about 275K, and he was nearing 300K and going strong last I heard. I think 300K Accord\\'s and Civics, AND Corolla\\'s and Camry\\'s are a dime a dozen moreso than counted on one or two hands!!!  If you peruse the Hyundai ownership discussions here, you\\'ll see many reports from owners with over 100k reliable miles on their Hyundais over 5-7 years. That\\'s enough to build a reputation for long-term reliability, IMO. 100K miles and 5 to 7 years maybe be ENOUGH to show reliability to some people, maybe even the average person, but to the person looking for some of the best stuff out there, you have to look to cars that reach 15 years and 250K+ plus regularly. That is Honda and Toyota quality.  Quality is in the eyes of the beholder.KD, beauty (styling) may be in the eyes of the beholder but quality (fit and finish) is something that can be measured. It\\'s quantitative not subjective: The paint is flawless or it\\'s not; the body seams are aligned or they aren\\'t. An imperfection is an imperfection. All cars usually have one or two (more?). I have given our 2007 Fusion the once over with a fine-tooth comb, metaphorically, several times and have found no flaws. I find the workmanship to be perfect, at least so far.Are there things that I would like to see improved or added? Of course. A light in the glove compartment would be nice. Is that a quality issue? Not hardly. Would I rather see a shark fin antenna rather than one with a mast? Absolutely. But that, too, is not a quality item, more of a personal preference.A piece of molding that falls off or is misaligned is a quality item, a flaw, something that can be scored, rated. Where it is placed is subjective. How it is attached is not.Again, Accord and Camry usually score highly in the area of quality. They both have high standards. But so do the Fusions, if ours is typical, and I believe that to be the case.  for any buyer that has ever had a lemon-like vehicle in the past is reliability, dependability, and quality.Unless you have time and money to burn.For me, the following are crucial:Power to economy ratio.... I want maximum power for every gallon of gas my engine will drink. If you have the most HP AND the most MPG, then it\\'s a complete no brainer to me. Price to quality to reliability to dependability to warranty ratio. Again, a warranty should be irrelevant to a well-built vehicle.Interior quality of materials and craftsmanship. I love the interior quality and build of an Audi, but Honda\\'s are so much more ergonomical and user friendly. They are both excellent examples of how to do interiors properly. And lastly... (but not necessarily least) Handling and fun factor on the twisties.  Quality is in the eyes of the beholder. :surprise: I have to agree that quality is quantitative.  If 1992 Accords and Camrys are a \"regular\" occurance, how come I don\\'t see hardly any of them on the road, when so many were sold?The \"average person\" would need to drive a car for 20 years to hit 250k miles. Few people stick with a car that long. If they could, before rust catches up.I owned a 1991 Caravan and it was rock-solid reliable. Looked and drove like new when I sold it after eight years. Would it have held up for another 7 years? Maybe. Would I want to own it for another 7 years? Nope. My needs had gone far beyond that vehicle in that time. If a Dodge can hold up for a long time, why pay the premium for an Accord or Camry just because you want to drive it into the ground? At the end, you\\'ll have a car that is worth almost nothing. So save your money up front and buy the lowest-priced car that meets your needs--like a Fusion or Mazda6 or Sonata maybe. They\\'ll all last many years with proper care.  probably less than .5% of population drives a car for 250k. why would you drive 1 car for so long? no one buys a car for that kind of reliability any more. i had acura cls and honda prelude and both cars had multiple tranny issues. gladly i bought a extended warranty, but man those cars really sucked. especially my 01 cls. 3 blown trannies! i live in acura board, and man both cl and tl\\'s tranny broke down faster than 80\\'s hyundai excel! only honda decent enough to last 150k in my family was my sister\\'s 96 civic. but finally broke down at 160k, she later traded to solara which really isn\\'t a bullet proof car. bottom line, honda and toyota quality is highly highly overrated IMO. acura cls probably had 10 times more tranny issues than all of recent hyundai combined. my 99 prelude had a lemon tranny as well. accord and civics were ok, but i was never satisfied with my 03 accord. it was a 1st year car, but had too many little annoying problems. not a big problem, but annoying problem. that\\'s why i traded my car to MDX which has been decent so far, but way way too thirsty. bottom line, no brand has a bullet proof quality. you are a dumb homer if you think your honyota will last forever.  So if the 09 Fusion gets a gasoline twin turbo direct injection 2.5L I4 with 260 hp and better fuel mileage than a V6 Camcord plus an updated exterior and interior you\\'d consider it?  300K FAIRLY trouble-free miles, not completely trouble free. It\\'s gonna cost you some repair and maintenance costs to get some Honda\\'s and Toyota\\'s to 300,000 miles (but some will get there w/o spending a dime other than maintenance). But that \"some\" isn\\'t all that much with Honda\\'s and Toyota\\'s. Your repair bills will be small, and very infrequent.I\\'m not sure Donald Trump nor Bill Gates could have afforded getting my mid 90\\'s Dodge to get to 300K miles, let alone 100K.   I think 300K Accord\\'s and Civics, AND Corolla\\'s and Camry\\'s are a dime a dozen moreso than counted on one or two handsYou thinking it does not make it so. I did a search for used Accords on autotrader, There were none with 300K mi, within 50 miles of me...this would include a metropolitan area with population over 2 million. There was only one that was over 200K miles (206,000). For the Camry there were also none at over 300K. The two highest were at 262K and 211K (these were the only ones over 200K).For sake of comparison, since the Fusion is too new, I looked for the Ford Taurus. There was one with over 200K mi (230,000) within 50 miles.I did not look for the compacts, as this is a midsize discussion  .  If the updated exterior and interior is free of bargain basement plastics and parts, or panel gaps, yes, I\\'d consider it as long as Ford matches Hyundai\\'s warranty.I might even settle for GM\\'s lessor warranty. It also should be cheaper than a Camcord, since I know resale value will stink.I\\'d also want to make sure the new Fusions EPA ratings match the real world withing the standard and typical 20% BS factor. So I\\'d need a full tank test drive, or around 350 miles.And lastly, to consider a Ford, I\\'d need to know I\\'m getting a rental vehicle for free from the dealer everytime I have to bring that baby in during it\\'s nice long warranty.  For the sake of argument... would you advertise that you are trying to sell a vehicle with over 200K miles? I think if I was paying for the advertisement I\\'d discretely leave off that information and let the pictures and test drive speak for themselves (though most all callers did ask how many miles were on the vehicle).I bet most of the sellers on Autotrader don\\'t list the mileage when the mileage isn\\'t a good sales point.  Good grief - you can find an excuse for everything. You should be a politician.  probably less than .5% of population drives a car for 250k. why would you drive 1 car for so long? no one buys a car for that kind of reliability any more. Ever heard of the USED car market?There is no such thing as resale value without it!!!!There are people buying and paying for used cars out there. There are people that can\\'t afford to buy new. There are people like my current wife who 5 years ago needed a car for $3,500 or so dollars and found a wonderful 92 Civic with 166K+ miles on it. It was fantastic for the next couple of years (perfect no, but still economical to keep running). We kept if for over two years, got it to over 200K miles, and sold it for $2,700 cash. Not bad. So it might take 3 owners or more to get to 300K and 15 years typically, but its going to take a Honda or Toyota to typically find a buyer (with some resale value) that 2nd and 3rd time on the market. Maybe even a 4th or 5th.  It\\'s gonna cost you some repair and maintenance costs to get some Honda\\'s and Toyota\\'s to 300,000 miles.....Your repair bills will be small, and very infrequent. That\\'s what all those Toyota Camry owners thought right before Toyota told them they had to pay for a new engine after theirs sludged up. But I guess that\\'s fixed now with the class action lawsuit.  Yes, let\\'s not let inconvenient facts get in the way of your preconcieved notions.  Again, who says a car can only have one owner to reach 300K miles? Who says the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th owner can\\'t reach the 20 year or 300K mark?Furthermore, why do you think Honda and Toyota enjoy superior resale value? Magic? Or is it being able to enjoy relatively trouble-free performace after 10 years and 100K?  wolverine, you say you\\'ve owned all these Acura\\'s and Honda\\'s that were not reliable. So I have a question. Why do you keep buying them? Maybe the other brands will be even worse?  Automotive Lease Guide says the Fusion resale value after 3 years is higher than a Camry and only 2% lower than an Accord.Did I mention it\\'s not 1990 anymore?  The Fusions been out for 3 years already???? WOW.... how did that happen? Where have I been.I\\'ll take predictions of the future with a grain of salt.... thank you very much.Does Automotive Lease Guide also recommend the rate of return for the S&P 500 for the next 3 years?  Quality is like a fine wine, some people don\\'t get it. Feel of the materials, fit and finish, extra touches, smoothness of the engine, economy etc. The Accord trumps, a premium is paid over others and for good reason. It is a hot seller and for a lot of people a no-brainer when looking for a family sedan.It nearly was for me, but AWD and turbo was the trump card.  For what it\\'s worth, the engine sludge problems are not slowing Toyota or Lexus down. You may not elect to purchase a Toyota product, but a lot of people have elected to make the Camry their next purchase. Good grief one can\\'t spit out the window without hitting an ES350.  I think the strong resale value on Accord and Camry comes from the overall solid quality and reliability of the cars, and the fact that much of bhe car buying public hasn\\'t wised up yet to the fact that there is little difference in quality and reliability now across almost all the mid-sized offerings. I just laugh when I see some of the resale prices on Accords and Camrys. I can get a really nice new car with a new-car warranty and all the latest safety and convenience features for less.  I think dealers try to overcharge significantly on recent model used Honda\\'s and Toyotas, they almost cost as much as a New one!However, I don\\'t think a 3 year old Accord will cost you as much as a comparable domestic mid-sizer. (True market value, not advertised costs).Furthermore, I don\\'t think the quality and reliability gap is as close or as closed as you\\'d like to think. But most importantly, that brand new domestic won\\'t be worth much in 3 years, and that Accord will hardly depreciate at all from year 3 to 6.  The ALG resale values are more than just \"predictions\". If you go to a bank to lease a car what do you think they use to determine the residual value? A crystal ball? ALG may be wrong but if they are then a lot of financial institutions stand to lose a lot of money.  Did the article say it only happened to domestic cars? Did you ever think just for a second that it might be due to poor maintenance? Or do you really think Hondas and Toyotas run forever with no maintenance ever?Your bias is clear and since you\\'re not willing to listen to hard facts I guess we\\'ll just stop here.   I just laugh when I see some of the resale prices on Accords and Camrys. I can get a really nice new car with a new-car warranty and all the latest safety and convenience features for less. What you need to think about is, people (like me) would rather drive a two year old Accord, than a brand new Fusion, and they may be laughing at you. This equals high resale. I guess you have to be one of \"us\" to understand.  I guess someone would have to be part of the \"us\" group to understand. It makes no sense to me. To me, buying any used car is a gamble. never know what the previous owner did or didn\\'t do to it. and many times, they sell their cars because they know something you don\\'t. I swore off buying used cars long, long ago. No way in the world I pay MORE for a used car that somebody possibly abused the hell out of, realized what he did, and decided to unload it, than I would for a brand new, 100k warrantied car. just because it had an \"H\" on the grille, or the toyota logo. each to their own I guess.  No way in the world I pay MORE for a used car that somebody possibly abused the hell out of, realized what he did, and decided to unload it, than I would for a brand new, 100k warrantied car.In reality, most used cars are not abused before they are traded in, or returned from lease. I have a couple of relatives who have never owned a car past the warranty. It\\'s like they think when the warranty runs out, things will automatically start breaking. These cars are maintained by the dealer, and taken care of (detailed monthly). They would be a great used car for anyone. There are plenty of great used cars out there.And if it has an \"H\" on the grill, you don\\'t need a warranty, right?  Your joking statement is really \"twice as good at half the price.\" That would make it something close to 4 times as good.And, your twice as good warranty is 1 year or 12K miles better than Hyundai\\'s B2B but 2 years less (and 20K miles more) than Hyundai\\'s power train.  I guess someone would have to be part of the \"us\" group to understand. It makes no sense to me. To me, buying any used car is a gamble. never know what the previous owner did or didn\\'t do to it. and many times, they sell their cars because they know something you don\\'t.

I totally agree. I\\'ll never buy used for the exact reasons you state. I\\'ve got my eyes on a Hyundai when my daughter reaches driving age in a little over a year. I want her to have a safe, new car with (hopefully) no issues. A used Civic? Na. A new Accent for the same money? Probably.And I\\'m a diehard Honda-er. But they don\\'t have a lock on building good cars.  C&D thinks maybe MY09 we\\'ll see it in the Fusion. That\\'s right in line with what I\\'ve read on other forums from Ford sources. It appears, from the articles I\\'ve read, that the TwinForce DI 2.5L I4 option for the Fusion will get 30% better fuel economy than the current I4 and offer more power. At what cost I don\\'t know.Add a little restyle inside and out (which we\\'ve possibly seen before here), another plant to meet demand and they\\'re back in business. :shades:  Hyundai Sonata\\'s long-term reliability rating has been climbing since approx the 2000 model year. Granted that was the previous generation Sonata, but if we can assume Accord/Camry reliability ratings carry forward from one generation to another, we should apply the same standard to the Sonata unless proven otherwise. You\\'re asking for a 6 year track record. Sonata already has a 7 or so year track record.  There are plenty of great used cars out there. I won\\'t argue that, but there are plenty more used cars that are junk, abused, mistreated ect.And if it has an \"H\" on the grill, you don\\'t need a warranty, right?  when did I ever imply that? I\\'ve been fortunate. I\\'ve been able to buy new for awhile now. Not anything I want, (never spent more than 23k) but if for some reason my finances changed, and I had to lower my spending amount to 15k, I would get the best new car I could for 15k. not a used, out of warrnaty one becase of the badge, whichever one it was.and actually pay more for that used one to boot.  This suggests that cars aren\\'t lasting more than the warranty periods. Well, my \\'05 Sonata GLS SV power train warranty is 10 years. If it quits after 10 years in will have cost me $1670 per year, plus 1/10th of the sales tax and other minor gov\\'t charges. If a Camcord quits at the end of it\\'s warranty, what is it\\'s annual cost?That\\'s a beauty of the Hyundai warranty...no major expenses until after the car loan has been paid off.  \\'ve got my eyes on a Hyundai when my daughter reaches driving age in a little over a year.thats funny, I\\'ve had the same discussion with my girls, the first of which will be driving in a year also. she actually went with me when I bought my 07 altima (I wanted her to see how damn expensive cars are) and saw several cars on the lot that she told me she would like to drive. I then informed her that her first car would most likely be domestic, or kia/hyundai. she said it wasn\\'t fair. :P  \"That\\'s not fair.\"Ask her what \"fair\" means. Many people say something is not \"fair\" when they should be saying they do not like something.But any kid should be happy if his/her parents by him a car, new or used, regardless of make or model. Tell her not to act spoiled, or else she won\\'t get ANY car.  I thought I would be disappointed with a then-7 year old Accord automatic 4-door. Plastic hubcaps, 130 horsepower, automatic.As it turns out, it STILL gets me from A to B, and when I turned 16, it didn\\'t matter what kind of car it was. It was a set of WHEELS!  Hi,Well maintained 06 Camry SE with 38000 miles on it. Owner\\'s offer is 16000. What u think? Shud I go for it?  Oh Heck no...Is it a V6 or I4? For a V6 I wouldn\\'t pay more than $14,500 and for an I4 not a dime more than $13,000.  Part of its my fault. I\\'ve let her know of my disdain for domestic cars, and have always talked highly of the honda/nissan cars I\\'ve owned. When informed that she would probably end up in a ford/GM due to price (she\\'ll pay for it herself, I\\'ll just co-sign) her reaction was more or less \"but you said fords arn\\'t any good\"But my first car was a I4 <100hp 85 1/2 ford escort with a 4spd manual. that was in \\'89 I think, and I was gratefull to have it. I realy missed it when I totaled it and ended up in a 1981 chevy chevette.  i4. Edmunds says 16,000. My offer was 15,2 and thinking if I shud up it.  I think dealers try to overcharge significantly on recent model used Honda\\'s and Toyotas, they almost cost as much as a New one! It isn\\'t just Honda and Toyota. When I sold my Mazda3 on my own, I noticed dealer ads for used Mazda3\\'s asking as much or more than what I paid for mine when it was new. It was easy for me to undercut the dealers and still get far more than I would have received as a trade in.  I think dealers try to overcharge significantly on recent model used Honda\\'s and Toyotas, they almost cost as much as a New one!Welcome to the subprime world in car sales. Its amazing - a guy with weak credit goes in to buy a new Honda. The prime lender says no, but the subprimer says OK to the used one COSTING THE SAME OR MORE as the new one!So the guy that has a tough time getting a good loan for various reasons ends up with a costlier loan on an older vehicle. Kinda backwards, but its the way of the world.They also use the used vehicles as bait for the new. You say \"why would I pay $26,000 for a used one when I can buy the new one for $26,500?\".  Relating back to a recent thread, this is an interesting choice: a used Camry for which the bumper-to-bumper warranty is expired, probably due for new tires soon (maybe it has new tires?), expensive 60k service due in 22k miles, and the previous-generation design... which was rated by most professional reviewers as behind cars like the Fusion and Sonata... vs. a brand-new mid-sized car like a Fusion, Milan, Sonata, Optima, or even a loaded Elantra (mid-sized interior, compact length) for about the same money. I\\'d go with the brand-new car (I\\'m very particular about break-in and maintenance), but if the Camry were Certified with an extended warranty and had all maintenance up to date and new rubber, and was in impeccable comdition, that could make it tougher.  It suggests to me that the people couldn\\'t really afford the car in the first place, nor the proper maintenance needed to keep the cars in service.OldCEM  yeah, and if you like to ride in a marshmellow on wheels... ok, ok, sorry that\\'s a bit harsh, but really, what do you find appealing about that car? do you like driving at all? or is it just a way to get from point a to b and that\\'s it? granted, my priorities are a little different, but when you consider most other midsize cars are just as reliable over a five year period according to Consumer Reports AND JD Powers, I don\\'t see the appeal of a camry at all. Especially a used one for 16k.  On my way home from work, it seemed like everyone was way too impatient to get their holiday started, so there was a lot of really bad driving, much moreso than usual. So I\\'m driving at 45mph passing cars stopped at a stop light in the lane that goes the opposite way as me, and out pops a bmw making a left turn right in front of me. To my left are all the cars waiting for the light to turn green, and to the right is a concrete wall...nowhere to go. Slam on my brakes and stop 3 feet from a fairly new 3 series bmw and a really freaked out girl sitting in the bmw\\'s passenger seat. My first thought was #$%@^&amp;*!!!. My second thought was glad I drove a Mazda6 with some of the best brakes in this class. So lesson #1... drive safely over the holidays people!!! Expect some really bad driving and be patient.And lesson #2... if you\\'re in the market for a new car, remember, good brakes can not only save you the hassle of getting your car fixed and appraised by an adjuster, but it could keep you and others from getting injured.  \"She might be happy with her Aura right now.... maybe even for a period of 3 years. But watch out when that warranty expires and the car goes to hell in typical domestic fashion.\"I have owned American domestic vehicles for over 25-years and have never experienced your nightmares. I have seen and heard the same regarding Japanese cars, but instead of calling them names and doubting their quality, I just take it as the one that got away during assembly, or the owners fault at not maintaining it. The same can be said for a Japanese car if not maintained, but the fact that you appear to actually believe what you are saying is pretty sad.  When informed that she would probably end up in a ford/GM due to price (she\\'ll pay for it herself, I\\'ll just co-sign) her reaction was more or less \"but you said fords arn\\'t any good\" And what was your response to that, did you admit that you had exxagerated?   yes, I did. I know ford builds pretty good cars now, as do GM and chrysler. My only problem with ford and the other domestic cars are problems I had 15 yrs ago. same held true with my last purchase. I love my altima, but looking at it logicaly, it is pretty hard to justify the extra 2-3k it cost over the fusion. I do think nissan puts a better engine in the altima, and the cvt is very nice, but don\\'t know that it justifies a 2-3 thousand premium.  do not, I repeat, DO NOT do the same mistake my Parents and I did with me.I was in a similar situation at 16 with my Dad willing to cough up some dough for a new car, but he put a dollar limit and I had to cover the rest. The dollar limit was a big mistake because it made me think I had to go American to get the most \"bang for my buck.\" And heck, it should be cheaper, there is less shipping costs right? :P Anyway, I was thinking horsepower, and fuel economy. I should have been thinking reliability, long term quality, and resale!With the lower dollar limit and my not having much money of my own, and thinking I just had to have a NEW car (a used Civic would have been a MUCH better choice, possibly literally a hundred times better choice!). So instead of getting a 2 or 3 year old Civic I got a new \\'95 Dodge. Wow, what a mistake. Do not do the same to your daughter. The few thousand you save now will be gone by year 4 in repair costs and tow truck services. Furthermore, she will be stranded multiple times, which is probably worse for a female than a male.Lastly, when she goes to trade it in or sell it privately, she\\'ll curse you and hate you forever when she gets peanuts and sees that the same year Honda is selling for $5-7,000 dollars still. So not only have you spent thousands extra in repair bills vs. the Honda or Toyota, and hundreds in tow truck costs, but then you get the final knockout punch in terrible resale value. Also there is the fact that 10% of the year your car is in the shop. Which means she\\'ll be borrowing yours.Happened to me.... since my Dodge was worth nothing, and I was still in college and poor, I had to \"borrow\" that 95 Camry of my parents for a few years until I got on my feet after college. That Camry ran fine and didn\\'t cause me any problems. Parents took it back when I bought 03 Accord Coupe and used it for even a few more years. Then they sold it at like 120K miles for 3,500 dollars.  >few thousand you save now will be gone by year 4 in repair costs and tow truck services.> she\\'ll curse you and hate you forever when she gets peanuts and sees that the same year Honda is selling for $5-7,000 dollars >Also there is the fact that 10% of the year your car is in the shop.Your exaggerations don\\'t make your post seem credible at all. So you\\'re basing all this \"knowledge\" on your experience with a Dodge that you chose badly? Have you checked JD Powers ratings on new cars the last several years? There\\'s no difference between most car brands.  >lemon stories are 100 to 1 in terms of quantity with American to Japanese. So the Americans are making 100 times more lemons than the Japanese,Everyone explains that the discussion groups attract the complainers. You can\\'t judge the numbers of real problems from a few complainers who post multiple places, multiple times and exaggerate. Some even make up complaints about cars they don\\'t like or feel threatened by to smear their image.As for your Dodge, is it possible your transmission was \"abused\"? I know how some young guys drive...  Nothing wrong with a 5 yr old Focus....great lil reliable car, you can prob pick it up for 3500 to 5,000...also dodge neon...dodge stratus...chevy Aveo....cobalt...etc..a 6 yr old civiv will still cost you almost 7 grand.  You realize that the Neon is the Dodge I had??????Anyway, to call the Neon a good choice or reliable is to call the State Lottery an excellent investment.You made my point though with the values you posted, Civic wins by 3K or more even with an extra year of age!  to continue off-topic conversation in this discussion. Posts are being removed, as will any further off-topic comments.  I have to agree with andre3 regarding this topic.When I went to college in 2000 my parents put a $15,000 limit for me to choose a car. Instead of a brand new compact or domestic I choose a 1997 Honda Accord LX with 36,000 miles on it. When I graduated from grad school in 2006, it had 120,000 miles on it. I handed it to my sister after purchased my current ride (an IS350 :blush: ) and it is still running strong as we speak. During the 6-year period I had the car, besides the routine maintenance the only other unexpected costs are 1. replace the alternator and 2. replace the radiator. Never had any problem with the engine or transmission and this is for imidazol97... I did drive it pretty aggressive  .With my and my family\\'s own experience, combine with andre3\\'s horror story I just can\\'t come up with a single reason why should I go with anything else other than a Honda or Toyota. Well... BMW might be another alternative when it\\'s time to part away with my IS350. :P  my Nephew 3 yrs ago bought a neon.....an 03 for about 6300.00 he put 80k miles on it in 3 yrs...No repairs other than brakes.oil...rubber (tires)....He sold it last month for 5100.00.  I bought my daughter a 328i for her 16th B-day. he\\'s now 19. We\\'ve done the brakes once and oil changes, no other repairs. I paid 8300.00 and could prob still sell it for 6500.00... Its a very very minst 96 328i....still looks new...#2 My 2nd daughter recieved a Mustang GT for her 16th...I found a mint 01 with about 80 k miles. She\\'s had it 1 full yr now.....No problems...oil changes only...So it really depends what the condition the car is when you buy it...and how good yopu are at negotiationg  a 6 yr old civiv will still cost you almost 7 grand.No way would I pay $7,000 for a 6-year-old Civic, a 2001 model.  \"There\\'s no difference between most car brands.\"Other than the fact the Dodge just issued a recall involving Nitros. In my mind there is a difference, and maybe a lot of people also see, hear and feel the difference.  And there\\'s no way I\\'d pay $1 for a brand new Dodge, let alone a used one!But let\\'s get back to the topic of midsize cars, which the Civic, nor the Neon is.  There are very few posts regarding the topical vehicles here in the last 24 hours or so. I think all of you remember that the other midsize sedans discussion was shut down because too many people could not stay on topic. It looks to me like we\\'re headed down the same road again.I have no plans for a Midsize Sedans 3.0. Any of you who would like this discussion to continue need to be mindful of the subject when you are preparing to post.If you have comments you\\'d like to make about some subject that doesn\\'t belong here, the search features on the left should help you. And either Kirstie or I or any host would be happy to help you find an appropriate discussion, just drop any of us an email.But here we are talking about midsize sedans. Period. You are putting your posting privileges at risk by continuing to ignore that. And if too many of you continue to ignore that, you are clearly saying this topic has run its course.  I don\\'t think Hyundai Sonata\\'s problem is history or reputation. I think their problem is style and substance. They are a bargain basement value vehicle option, plain and simple. They might offer good bang for the buck, but they aren\\'t making the best cars out there in any segment by any stretch of the imagination. Best gas mileage, nope. Best power, nope. Best interior, nope. Best price, yes. Any facts to the contrary need sources and explanations, I never heard of the Sonata having class leading mileage.  Seven years ago I might have gone the used Accord route also. But now it\\'s 2007 and the mid-sized sedan market is much different, with many fine choices. For example, when I was at the Mazda dealer the other day having my van serviced, I noticed that the no-haggle price on a 2007 Mazda6i Special Value Edition (17\" alloys, sport package, CD changer, power seat etc.) was about $16k. Great looking car, great driving car, brand new, full factory warranty, free oil changes for life (from this dealer). I\\'ve seen Milans and Fusions advertised at $15k recently, and Sonatas under $14k. So nowadays I\\'d tend to go the new car route if I had $15-16k to spend on a car, unless I needed something above the mid-sized sedan class e.g. a minivan (which btw I bought used as a 2002 last year for only $12.5k with a 100k bumper-to-bumper zero-deductible warranty, MSRP was twice that, and the interior looked like the van had never been driven).  Great looking car, great driving car, brand new, full factory warranty, It should be noted that Mazda slashed their \"full factory warranty\" term by 25% in both mileage and years for 2007.So with cheaper prices comes \"we don\\'t stand behind our product anymore.\"The dealer\\'s explanation at the Mazda in Southern California was not holding water for me, he said \"If Honda and Toyota can do it, why can\\'t Mazda?\"LOL, I can think of a lot of red circle reasons. I\\'m not saying Mazda doesn\\'t make good vehicles, but I don\\'t think they are at Honda/Toyota league levels. If I was considering a Mazda6, I\\'d want the longer warranty.  I am having this feeling of deja vu, all over again. :confuse: Here is the link noting the Sonata being #1 in fuel economy in its EPA class:http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bestworst.shtmlAlso, the Sonata leads the mid-sized class in interior room. Note on the following page, none of the other cars are in the mid-sized class (EPA classes are by interior volume, meaning Accord, Camry, and all the rest of the cars we are discussing here have less interior volume than the Sonata):http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byEPAclass.htmAlso, the Sonata has more standard safety equipment than any other car in the mid-sized class we are discussing here. It\\'s the only car from this discussion with standard ABS, ESC, side airbags and curtains, four-wheel disc brakes, and active front head restraints standard on all trim lines.  If you are looking for a long warranty in the mid-sized class, check out the Galant, Optima, or Sonata--all have a 5/60k bumper-to-bumper warranty and 10/100k powertrain warranty.I guess you could also say that, with the higher prices of Accords and Camrys comes \"we don\\'t stand behind our products\", given their relatively short warranties.  http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bestworst.shtml Also, the Sonata leads the mid-sized class in interior room. Note on the following page, none of the other cars are in the mid-sized class (EPA classes are by interior volume, meaning Accord, Camry, and all the rest of the cars we are discussing here have less interior volume than the Sonata): The problem with your link and argument is that it is plainly and truly false. The EPA has a weird \"rental car-like company\" way of classifying cars. Most people wouldn\\'t buy that the Sonata is a \"full size car\" as listed by the EPA. It is a midsize car and hence one of the cars in this discussion.Furthermore, ANY midsizer would have the best gas mileage in the large SUV category, so that goes to show you how missclassification can make the Sonata seem better than it is in fuel economy. The truth is, that midsize sedans (which are the topic of this forum) are lead by Toyota and Nissan on the website link you provided. Lastly, the 4 cylinder Accord gets 10-15% better mileage than the Sonata, both in city and highway.  I don\\'t think Hyundai Sonata\\'s problem is history or reputation. I think their problem is style and substance. They are a bargain basement value vehicle option, plain and simple.I have no complaints to air about the Sonata and actually own a Fusion -- are there any other Fusion (Milan) owners on this thread? -- but the Sonata\\'s MSRP doesn\\'t seem all that much of a \"bargain basement\" price. Am I missing something?What does a well-equipped, top-of-the-line V6 Accord or V6 Camry go for these days? $30,000? Aren\\'t the 4-cylinder base models of the Fusion (Milan), Altima, Legacy, Accord, Camry, Aura, et al all within a thousand dollars of each other?By the way, GM\\'s having an Accord and Camry on the Aura\\'s showroom floor is a very gutsy move. It will be interesting to see how this pans out. It\\'s taking Ford\\'s \"Challenge\" one step higher.No market segment has keener competition than the mid-size one. High stakes poker at work here. I am noticing a significant increase in the number of Honda ads here lately, mostly for the Accord.  Yes, Honda and Toyota were forced to increase their powertrain warranties from a paltry 3 years/36k miles to 5 years/60k miles to get closer to what the competition is offering. If the Accord and Camry are better built than the competition, and as rock-solid reliable as you claim, then increasing the powertrain warranty (even the bumper-to-bumper warranty) would cost Honda and Toyota nothing, but would reap benefits in having the best-backed cars in the mid-sized class. Imagine an Accord with a 10-year, 150,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a 20-year, 300,000 mile powertrain warranty--transferrable of course. Toyota could do the same with the Camry. What great selling tools! Honda and Toyota could even get away with eliminating incentives on the Accord and Camry, maybe even raise prices some, because of the value of these long warranties. At no extra cost to Honda and Toyota. Why do you suppose they haven\\'t taken this easy step to demonstrate in a big way that they have a huge lead on their competition in reliability, while increasing their profits on the Accord and Camry (and their other vehicles)?  You know, it\\'s hard to have a discussion with someone who asks for links to back up an assertion, then when the links are provided they simply say, \"it is plainly and truly false.\"I don\\'t see what is false about the fact that the Sonata leads its EPA class in fuel economy. It is a fact, plain and simple. Sonata has the room of a large car. That is the EPA class it is in. It has more interior room than any other car we are discussing here. That advantage allows the Sonata to grab the #1 spot in fuel economy for large cars. Large-car interior room for a mid-sized price--and a low mid-sized price at that. More demonstration of the Sonata\\'s value, wouldn\\'t you say?  Backy,I suspect your tongue was firmly implanted in your cheek when you wrote that. Either that or a touch of sarcasm. But I like the idea. Heck, I\\'d trade in our new Fusion for an Accord with a deal like that. LOL. Who wouldn\\'t?  and considering honda will replace or repair any part of the car, free of charge, regardless of milage anyways.......it make even more sense. If they\\'re going to pay the expense anyhow, why deny the advertising.  Exactly! Accord and Camry would leave all others in the dust with a warranty program like that. At least until the other automakers respond in some way.Ow! I bit my toungue!!   Honda Accord\\'s and Toyota Camry\\'s don\\'t have to do anything with their warranties because why fix what ain\\'t broke?The are already the leading sellers in this midsize market. The Accord\\'s fuel numbers were 24/34 last I checked in the 4 cylinder. What are the Sonata\\'s?Are you saying your linked website is infallible? Just because it is written doesn\\'t mean it is so.   If my last Accord would have had a 100k mile warranty, it would have saved me the cost of one temperature control knob. I am halfway to 100k miles on my present Accord, and don\\'t think a 100k mile warranty would do any more for me than the last one would have. The warranty on my Accord has little meaning to me.  Good thing the warranty has little meaning to you, because the bumper-to-bumper warranty expired some 14,000 miles ago and you have only about 10k miles left on the powertrain warranty.A warranty is an insurance policy. It\\'s appreciated in two ways: 1) peace of mind it provides, and 2) when something breaks. I would have loved to have had a longer warranty when the A/C condenser went out on my Civic shortly after the warranty expired--cost me $900 to fix. A friend of mine just replaced the failed tranny in his Odyssey at about 95k miles. Fortunately, he had invested in an extended warranty up to 100k miles, so he didn\\'t have to pay nearly $3000 out of pocket. You can bet HE appreciated the extra warranty coverage.The fact is, both Honda and Toyota know their cars break, so extending the warranties on the Accord and Camry would cost them big bucks. So they don\\'t do it.  You are welcome to do your own research, and tell us all about it here, to prove that the information on the EPA web site that I linked to is in error. Until then, the Sonata has at least three \"#1\\'s\", not zero as you asserted:* #1 in large-car fuel economy* #1 in interior volume for all sedans in this discussion* #1 in standard safety features for all sedans in this discussionPower advantage? Who cares. I sure don\\'t. Nor do the majority of mid-sized car buyers who buy cars with four-cylinder engines vs. V6s. 0-60 in 6.6 seconds and a top speed of over 140 mph is way more than I or most people need.  you are leading the pack in this discussion, man. But with me you\\'re preaching to the choir. I just wonder how you might have done as a trial lawyer!The Hyundai Sonata or the Kia Optima would be my choices in this class. The way I look at it, a long Warranty is a smarter, gutsier move by a car manufacturer. I don\\'t see evidence, at least in my own experience or of other trustworthy sources, that either Hyundai or Kia are squirming out of their responsibilities regarding their end of the Long-Haul Warranty, either.I think in light of all these commendable quality reports it\\'s time for many more Americans to squarsh some reason in to their brains and quit over-hyping the Honda\\'s and Toyota\\'s. Nausea-nauseum-nausea-barfo! What\\'s more is the Honda\\'s and Toyota\\'s look so..ummm...dull. Yukko! :sick:  Aren\\'t the 4-cylinder base models of the Fusion (Milan), Altima, Legacy, Accord, Camry, Aura, et al all within a thousand dollars of each other? Perhaps the MSRPs are, but not the actual selling prices. Comparably equipped, the Fusion, Milan, Mazda6 and Sonata sell for thousands less than Camry, Accord, or Altima. I\\'m not sure where the others fall.For example, as someone posted, you can get the Mazda6 sport value for about $16K. This is comparable to the Accord SE. I believe the Accord SE goes for about $19K.  doubt you\\'ll get it that cheap. 19k is about the price of the vp (value priced) which is very bare bones.  doubt you\\'ll get it that cheap. 19k is about the price of the vp (value priced) which is very bare bones.Yeah but that is MSRP again. They have been more like 17k the last couple months as they try to clear out the \\'07s before the \\'08s get here.JS is about right, if you check the prices paid forums, the Accord SE is about 19k or so.Incidentally, the VP (previously known as DX) has pw/pl/abs/cc/tilt/split fold seat, etc. Whats missing is rear drums vs discs, rear speakers, sway bars, and the alloy wheels. A livable package for the asking price. If I went that route I would budget $60 to get a leather wheel and shifter, and another $100 to get 6x9s for the parcel shelf and call it a day.I think I would still be more likey to go with the Mazda, however, as a sunroof is available before stepping up to the highest trim level. I think that is the only thing we miss on the Subaru, is we should\\'ve stepped up a model for the sunroof and heated seats/mirrors.  Hello out there. Anyone home? Fusion likely getting the TwinForce DI I4 this time next year for MY09. Edmunds now says 25% better fuel econ which gives us roughly 28 or 29 city and 38 or 39 highway. Plus more power.Sorry to talk about the actual cars (not that I don\\'t drift off topic a lot too) but that\\'s pretty big news I\\'d say. Will the Accord be able to match or beat that with a regular gas engine? I\\'m guessing their diesel will but the Fusion Hybrid should beat both.You guys wanted Ford to answer Honda and Toyota. I think they are really starting to now. The restyle renderings we saw of the Fusion a little while back were for \\'09 too right?  I\\'ll admit the Twinforce DI I4 does sound promising, and im hoping it actually delivers the better economy as promised, as this is the type of technology ford needs ASAP. Also noticing ford seems to be waking up and beginning to become more competitive, however the ever improving competition is not sitting still either, so if this engine arrives by MY09 I feel it will face stiff competition with similar or better attributes.  Sorry but you\\'re beating a dead horse here. This isn\\'t really an opinion to challenge; everything backy presented were facts. Like it or not, the Sonata is a large car, as classified by the EPA.What\\'s more interesting, IIRC, the Sonata is the shortest car (length-wise) vs. the Accord the Camry; it also has the shortest wheelbase of the three, yet, it comes with the most spacious interior (per volume) and trunk space (per cu. ft.). I think the Accent and the Elantra is also each a class up from the rest of the class, similar to the Sonata here.Personally, I tend to believe the actual numbers than what you posted and claimed as the \"truth\".  Good thing the warranty has little meaning to you, because the bumper-to-bumper warranty expired some 14,000 miles ago and you have only about 10k miles left on the powertrain warranty.My 03\\'s warranty (including powertrain) ran out at 36k miles. Do I look worried? :shades:  The Fusion has AWD now - where are the AWD Camcords? 08 Fusion will have Sync - where is the Camcord equivalent?Ford was behind on engine technology and interior design, but I think both will be fixed with the 09 model. However they are leading in other areas that always seem to get overlooked.  The Fusion has AWD now - where are the AWD Camcords? 08 Fusion will have Sync - where is the Camcord equivalent?Ford was behind on engine technology and interior design, but I think both will be fixed with the 09 model. However they are leading in other areas that always seem to get overlooked.  It seems to typicaly go; asian\\'s release car that includes or does x. ford says, in 2 years we\\'ll have the same. 2 years later asians offer y. ford again says, in 2 years we\\'ll offer y.Maybe I\\'m wrong here but our 2007 Fusion has a six-speed automatic transmission (very nice and quite responsive, I might add). I don\\'t believe the Asian mid-size sedan manufacturers offer that yet.Our Fusion also has AWD. Except for Legacy, I don\\'t believe the Asian companies offer that.Our Fusion also has puddle lamps, lights built into the rear-view mirrors that illuminate the ground around the door at night. Not a big deal, but a nice touch not offered on the Accords, Camrys, Altimas, et al.Although certainly not state-of-the art, the Duratec 3.0-liter, 221-horsepower V6 has a proven track record and is powerful enough for most drivers. Just how truly important are 0-to-60 times and how many times a day, week, month or year does one second faster matter?  The Fusion has AWD now - where are the AWD Camcords? 08 Fusion will have Sync - where is the Camcord equivalent? Which brings me to another point with the Ford Fusion in particular. Why does ford seem to add items over time with their vehicles instead of just releasing them with most of the important items available. Ford knew introducing a new midsize vehicle in 06 a nav system would be needed, std ABS, std side airbags, ect. For 07 ford added AWD, DVD nav, std side airbags, for 08 there adding rear sonar, sync, std abs and stragely no ESC yet. I think these upgrades makes an 06 Fusion seem dated content wise to say the least. Ford needs to start producing vehicles from the start with most of these options available. And i understand ford is addressing shortcomings the fusion has, however when the Accord was new in 03 you could pretty much get every option that the 07 accord has with the exception of VSA on the V6 and other small cosmetic changes. So if i purchased an 03 Accord i wouldnt feel my vehicle is terribly out of date in just 4 short years.  Maybe I\\'m wrong here but our 2007 Fusion has a six-speed automatic transmission (very nice and quite responsive, I might add). I don\\'t believe the Asian mid-size sedan manufacturers offer that yet.The V6 Camry has a 6spd auto as well. (Hopefully all of the glitches have been worked out of it by now.) Although certainly not state-of-the art, the Duratec 3.0-liter, 221-horsepower V6 has a proven track record and is powerful enough for most drivers. Just how truly important are 0-to-60 times and how many times a day, week, month or year does one second faster matter?I really dont feel the manufactures produce these new higher horsepower powertrains for 0-60 purposes, but newer technology allows the engine to produce higher horsepower while also improving mpg. So its essentially a win win situation for the consumer. And yes for the record 221 hp is more than enough for a typical midsize vehicle, but when you can have 270hp and identical MPG or better why not?  The V6 Camry has a 6spd auto as wellNissan went a different route with the cvt. It isn\\'t limitied to a mere 6 gears :P  The 09 Fusion will probably not improve enough to win a full comparison test vs. an 03 Accord, (which would be 6 years old by then). The Fusion is MORE than a generation behind, IMO.  Nissan went a different route with the cvt. It isn\\'t limited to a mere 6 gears I like the new Altima and applaud Nissan for being different and using the CVT. I say its a risky move for Nissan being that the Altima is the company\\'s best seller. CVT still seems a little controversial to me. Especially for a high volume midsize vehicle. CVT is a great technology, but its not for everyone (including myself). Its doesn\\'t have a very long track record, and it seems for some of the manufacturers who offered CVT\\'s before they all seemed to abandon them after only a couple of years. But to Nissans defense i haven\\'t heard much about the CVT equipped Murano\\'s so maybe nissan has cracked the code to build a CVT reliably.Besides with most modern trannys the shifts are undetectable anyway. :P  I\\'m not sure you can make that assumption, since we don\\'t know enough about it yet. Remember, the Fusion came in second out of four in one major comparison back in 2006. Wouldn\\'t take too much to push it to first (some refinement and horsepower/better MPG/better interior).I really don\\'t feel the Fusion to be more than a generation behind. Compare the current Fusion to the 2002 Accord EX-V6. It\\'s more than comparable.  Your right, the CVT is a huge risk for them. if that thing develops a problem, they\\'re in big trouble.Besides with most modern trannys the shifts are undetectable anywayIts much, much more than that   0-60 times matter significantly because it is the best indicator of what our 0-60 might take at half throttle, or 1/4 throttle. If it is faster at full throttle, it stands to reason it\\'ll be faster at partial throttle.If it is 1 second faster at full throttle, that does\\'nt mean the difference wouldn\\'t be even more pronounced at 1/4 throttle, only test drives could tell this.By the way, what is the importance of AWD in an underpowered Fusion? AWD just weighs it down making it turn into a tank and gas hog.  elroy5,i\\'ve owned deville, olds delta 88, firebird, sonata, bmw 325i, and ford focus as well. i\\'m not a brand homer like some people in this board and i buy whatever i want. i like my mdx, but i\\'m going to trade it to something less thirsty sometime next year. also, i\\'m very interested in the new tibby RWD coming out next year.if i was in a market for midsized sedan, i would buy either aura, mazda6 or hyundai sonata.   Remember, the Fusion came in second out of four in one major comparison back in 2006. Two out of 4, isn\\'t saying much.Wouldn\\'t take too much to push it to first (some refinement and horsepower/better MPG/better interior). These points are not so easily attainable, at least not for them.  By the way, what is the importance of AWD in an underpowered Fusion? AWD just weighs it down making it turn into a tank and gas hog.It also turns the Fusion from a so-so winter car to a better-handling, better-controlled car in the white stuff. It MAY not make any sense south of the Mason-Dixon line, but there\\'s a reason why Subaru sells well in the Northeast.  i\\'m very interested in the new tibby RWD coming out next year.Forgive my ignorance, what\\'s a \"tibby?\"  What do you guys/gals think?I think discussing that topic will bring a howl from the hosts to get back to the mid-size sedan thread theme. But as a Fusion owner I would like to see FoMoCo devote more resources into Fusions so it will increase my car\\'s value.  Forgive my ignorance, what\\'s a \"tibby?\"Possibly a Hyundai Tiburon  It did.   And yes for the record 221 hp is more than enough for a typical midsize vehicle, but when you can have 270hp and identical MPG or better why not? If everyone is so worried about fuel economy they why don\\'t they improve that without adding power? The rumored PIP Duratec30 for the \\'09 Fusion is going to offer a modest power increase with an increase in fuel mileage. That\\'s more of a \"win win\" wouldn\\'t you say?   I agree and conversation about that hatchback may be pursued in the Tiburon group.  Two out of 4, isn\\'t saying much. Yeah, it was just the Accord, Camry, and Sonata IIRC. All weak players in this category.These points are not so easily attainable, at least not for them. Wasn\\'t the difference between #1 and #2 more or less based on the interior? The new Accord interior doesn\\'t look to be leaps and bounds above the competition IMO. It\\'s a nice progression but it\\'s not too terribly different from the pics I\\'ve seen. Therefore I\\'m not sure where you\\'re coming from? :confuse:  Re 1/2, 1/4, full throttle applications.It is my understanding that all of these newer \"fly by wire\" applications provide almost identical acceleration throughout, regardless of the \"position\" of the throttle. I am not current on these matters, but the last time I checked it was more like \"flipping a switch\", so it would either be on or off. I am certain that some of our more knowledgeable posters will contribute further guidance in this matter.Van  Why does ford seem to add items over time with their vehicles instead of just releasing them with most of the important items available.This is probably my biggest gripe with Ford. Most of this came from the beancounters where the engineers were forced to pick and choose which features to offer because there either wasn\\'t enough engineering resources to do it or there wasn\\'t enough money left in the vehicle budget. That has been fixed as of last year. The other reason is Ford\\'s new strive for quality. Introducing a lot of new technologies at the same time is risky. Keeping the launch of a new vehicle as simple as possible gives you a higher probability of success. Given the Fusion\\'s reliability and quality achievements I\\'d say it worked. However, it is frustrating and it gives the Ford detractors too much ammunition. Ford used to think it had to compete on price with high volumes. Fields has said publicly that not\\'s profitable and that they need to is focus (no pun intended) on better vehicles with more options.I was surprised to see the Vista Roof and Navigation available on the Edge day 1. In the past these would have been late additions or MKX exclusive items. The 2009 Flex shows the upgraded Ford interior themes and has all of the expected available options. I expect the same for the 09 Fusion and all new vehicles going forward.If the competition thinks it\\'s business as usual at Ford they\\'re going to be unpleasantly surprised.  the last time I checked it was more like \"flipping a switch\", so it would either be on or off.Nope. ETC (electronic throttle control) gives you as much (if not more) throttle positions. It is not binary (on/off). The only difference is that ETC sends the requested throttle input to the computer and the computer decides how that translates to actual throttle changes. This allows the computer to better coordinate transmission shifts (as opposed to a physical cable where the computer can only react to throttle input after it happens) and normally allows for smoother operation.  What would you guys think if the 09 Fusion interior looked like this (with ambient lighting)?  Since I don\\'t care for plood (plastic wood) of any description, I like the piano black dash of our Fusion better. What Ford vehicle is that anyway?  It\\'s a secret! (hint - right click and view the image or do properties)That might actually be real wood instead of plood - hard to tell. I\\'m sure if it\\'s offered on the Fusion there will be alternatives just like today with the piano black and carbon fiber.  Thanks for that info. I thought I was a little behind the time in my thinking, but guess that just shows that if you don\\'t stay on top of things all the time, you get left in (or out of)the technology express. These forums are great.van  Well you asked.Funky gauges. Funky turn signal lever at 10:00 instead of 9:00 like the rest of the world. Why the wood on the steering wheel? Never understood the desire for that. Ford and Lincoln need to rethink their steering wheel look. Too boxy looking. Shoot, even the Hyundai Elantra has gone to a Honda/Acura look wheel. Sleek and attractive.Bag the blue Emblem too. But Fords turn me off. There. I\\'m done.  Funky turn signal lever at 10:00 instead of 9:00 like the rest of the world.That is one of the first \"different\" things I noticed about our 2007 Fusion. Now, having gotten used it, I find the 10 o\\'clock position to be much more logical and easier to use. Our other two Ford products have the 9 o\\'clock position and that arrangement now seems \"wrong\" to me.Ford and Lincoln need to rethink their steering wheel look.Again, I find the Fusion steering wheel to be handy and logical. I like it a lot. However, I agree on the fake wood: It shouldn\\'t be there. Ours is wrapped in leather; is very comfortable. Heck, I even like the Blue Oval. Very distinctive. I think a manufacturer should be proud of the product it makes. Enough so to put their name on it prominently.But Fords turn me off.At least you are honest. I actually find some redeeming qualities about all of the mid-size sedan entries but find that the Ford Fusion offers more of the qualities that I like.Different strokes for different folks. Choice is what it\\'s all about. When it comes to automobiles, none are 100 percent for 100 percent of the people.  I have driven a Lincoln LS loaner and own an Aviator with a wood wheel and it\\'s quite nice if you\\'re going for elegance over sportiness.I doubt the wood wheel would be used for the Fusion anyway. The question was more about the overall look and design and materials. Looks very good to me.In case you haven\\'t figured it out by now it\\'s the dash from the 2009 Ford Flex due out next summer. All new Ford interiors should be similar.  My take on this...Likes:- Center console- A/C vent layoutDislikes:- Woodtrim inside the gauge- Woodtrim on the steering wheel- Truck like steering wheel- Gauge design- Shifter (not gated)- Cup holder has no cover  Why does the shifter have to be gated? Doesn\\'t that just cause more work to shift? I never understood that design philosphy.Similarly - why do you need covers for the cupholders? I use mine daily to hold things other than cups.  At least nobody is saying it looks cheap so I guess that\\'s a good sign.  By the way, what is the importance of AWD in an underpowered Fusion? AWD just weighs it down making it turn into a tank and gas hog.I won\\'t spend my whole day trying to correct all the bad info you\\'ve spouted, but AWD helps in cornering too. It\\'s much easier to get on the throttle quicker at the apex. And since pretty much any engine in this class can get wheel spin from a standing start, AWD also helps make sure all available power gets to the ground rather than just providing tire smoke. Of course there are the advantages of traction in slippery conditions which are much more than just snow... living in the great northwest, I have lots of experience with rain and AWD is very reassuring to have when there is rain. The car I have is not AWD, but my last car, a Subie, did. Although it had about the same HP as my Accord, it handled much much better in the areas that I mention above. When I test drove a Mazdaspeed6 which has AWD along with much more power, I took it on a route that I often go when I want to have some fun on curvy roads so I am very familiar with how my non-AWD car handles there. The AWD version of the Mazda6 was much quicker coming out corners even though it is quite a bit heavier. In the end, AWD just offers more grip and if and when you like to have a little fun, traction is always a good thing.  Here is the senario. I rented a 2006.5 Kia Optima (30K miles showing) LX 2.4 liter 4 cylinder 5 speed automatic. I drove this car about 1000 miles exactly over 2 days with 4 adult passengers and all our luggage. Route of travel included driving west to the far south western corner of Ohio from western Pa. Here are my observations:1.The car was comfortable...quiet..rode smoothly with plenty of room in the rear (at least my normally outspoken mother-in-law was quiet). It handled the Laurel Highland portion of the drive on the Pa Turnpike (moderately curvy) fine at speed although this portion WAS smoothed out for more gentle turns by PennDot.2.Power wise it cruised the whole trip at 75mph including mountainous terrain and rarely shifted out of 5th. It fairly jumped off the line and reved freely through about 5K RPM (remember my MIL was in the back) when entering on ramps to cruise speed. No problems there. Additionally at idle it was imperceptable (so this may be engine refinement?) and quiet on acceleration and at cruise speeds. 3. I refilled the tank twice...refill #1 was around 12.3 gallons with 384 miles showing on the trip odometer = 30.8 mpg (approx)...refill #2 was at our start point on the return with 409 miles showing since the previous refill. I can\\'t remember the gallons used, but calculated to 29.9 mpg at the time. Both refills occurred with approx. 1/4 tank remaining so fuel economy was good with 4 passengers and my driving speed (75 mph most of the time).4. I particularly liked the steering wheel controls for the radio. The Ac was on almost all of the trip and was COLD cooling even the rear seat area without rear mounted HVAC vents. 5. Final observations...I liked it quite a lot but being a low end rental I would upgrade models if purchased and given the choices on engines in Optima\\'s I would opt for the 4 verses the 2.7 V-6.I found I needed another rental urgently this week (transmission on our 1995 187K mile Dodge Stratus died..is this a sign of inferior domestic quality?) and was given a 2007 Ford Fusion \"S\" 4 cylinder with 5.5K miles. A few observation on it as compared to the Optima.1.high rear deck/trunk obscures rear vision, for me anyhow.2. VERY noisy engine (induction noise?) AND exhaust noise on acceleration. Engine noisier at idle.. busy mechanical noises(not knocking) but you know it is running unlike the Optima.3. Sluggish normal acceleration without \"getting into it\" as compared to the Optima. But if you do get into it it seems OK but still \"feels\" slower than the Optima... measured numbers aside.4. Taunt ride and sharper handling.5. missing nice touches standard on the low level Optima..steering wheel radio controls for example. Since I have only had the Fusion a day or so I will form other opinions I am sure and I\\'ll let you know. But for now here is one. The Optima is a car where I was sure I was doing about 70 mph only to find I was doing 80 whereas the Fusion is one where I was sure I was doing about 70 mph only to find I was doing 60.  Gated shifter is just my own preference. I feel it\\'s a easier way to shift because one doesn\\'t have to first press a button then move the shifter. That\\'s a 2-step process versus gated shifter\\'s one. On top of that I think it looks better.I don\\'t use my cupholders that much thus I prefer it to have a cover so the area looks more elegant.  That was a very interesting report, Target. Thanks for posting it.   At least nobody is saying it looks cheap so I guess that\\'s a good sign.Doesn\\'t look cheap. Just Fordy. I\\'ve owned a few Fords have have been disappointed overall with their offerings. I now buy Hondas because their execution of everything in their cars is so excellent. Ford can\\'t match their interiors let alone their mechanicals.Good luck Ford. But with the Asians being so strong in small cars I don\\'t see how Ford can hang with them. They should stick to trucks.  Nicely written report. Lots of factual information rather than subjective. Was your trip I70-I71 to SW Ohio/Cincy?? Your driving was mostly interstate?  That might actually be real wood instead of plood - hard to tell.For me wood or plood makes no difference, I hate \\'em both.  Looks like really cheap hard gray plastics to me..... Not attractive at all.  Gated shifter is just my own preference. I feel it\\'s a easier way to shift because one doesn\\'t have to first press a button then move the shifter. That\\'s a 2-step process versus gated shifter\\'s one. On top of that I think it looks better. Agree. When I bought my mazda6 I did not think much of it...I could take it or leave it. Then I realized there was no button, so now I prefer the gated style...not that the lack of one would be a deal-breaker.  As opposed to expensive soft plastic? Any other objective comments?  I actually care about the \"look\" more than the \"feel\" I know cheap when I see it, and I know good quality when I see it. I do spend time \"feeling and touching\" all of the interior materials when I\\'m shopping and checking out a new car, but the look matters most. I just don\\'t like the 1995 Dodge Neon Interior plastic look of the Ford picture you provided. (note the designs are different but it looks like the same plastic material).  \"By the way, what is the importance of AWD in an underpowered Fusion? AWD just weighs it down making it turn into a tank and gas hog.\"The Fusion seems to be a good Ford car from what I have read, but the comment from the owner who has one that gets less than 16 mpg in the city is pretty disappointing in my book. I don\\'t think I could live with a car that got that low of mileage.  I do spend time \"feeling and touching\" all of the interior materials when I\\'m shopping and checking out a new carandre3, I wonder why you and I both prefer Honda\\'s interior... :P That\\'s exactly the way I shop for a car or checking out one at the carshow.I just don\\'t think it\\'s fair that someone like us being criticized for having higher standard about the interior than the average buyers.  If you think that looks like a Neon interior you need to have your eyes checked or get a new monitor. That looks more like an expensive Audi interior than a Ford interior.I guess if it had a H on the steering wheel it would be perfect.  but the comment from the owner who has one that gets less than 16 mpg in the city is pretty disappointing in my book. I don\\'t think I could live with a car that got that low of mileage.I might be the owner you are thinking of Poncho167, and our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion only gets 14.8 in all-city driving. The revised EPA estimate for this power train is only 17 mpg city and 24 highway.Since 95 percent of our driving is in-city, we should have bought an I4, manual or automatic. We don\\'t \"need\" the all-wheel drive either but it sure does improve the handling.  The Fusion seems to be a good Ford car from what I have read, but the comment from the owner who has one that gets less than 16 mpg in the city is pretty disappointing in my book. I don\\'t think I could live with a car that got that low of mileage.\"City\" mileage will vary a lot. This is because the type of driving that is called \"city\" varies a lot. For example CR routinely measures well below the EPA numbers because they do a very severe city driving test. CR typically measures about 13-15 mpg city, for these midsize sedans with V6.EPA test of AWD Fusion is now at 17 mpg. Without AWD the V6 is at 18 mpg, which is exactly the same as the Accord. The Fusion AWD costs you about 1 mpg city and 2 highway, I think this is a pretty typical AWD penalty.  More Flex interior pics from that siteCan\\'t find any without the wood. I can\\'t say I like any of the wood either. Although the light colored wood in my dad\\'s Zephyr is quite fetching. I much prefer the aluminum (yes it\\'s real) in my Mustang or the shiny black carbon fiber treatment in our Explorer. But then again, both have the radio \"brick\" that no one likes.  That might actually be real wood instead of plood - hard to tell. I\\'m sure if it\\'s offered on the Fusion there will be alternatives just like today with the piano black and carbon fiber.Yeah thats what I was thinking. I would like the CF trim more than the wood, or a flat aluminum look maybe. I don\\'t think there is anything about that dash that looks cheap though. Although this particular configuration doesn\\'t appeal to me, I like how Ford continues to reinvent the corporate instrument cluster to tailor it for each vehicle where they use it.  I have to say I don\\'t give a rats tushie about the shifter being gated or not. Either its a manual trans with a clutch pedal or its not, and if its not, then I\\'m not interested anyway.  apparently i am not one of the enlightened ones, because i don\\'t see what\\'s so special about honda interiors. my inlaws have a civic hybrid and a new CRV, and neither of them impress me too much. I personally find the infiniti G35\\'s new interior to be absolutely beautiful (but that\\'s not a car for this topic...oops!)while the styling of the ford flex interior is not my cup of tea, i find it rather ignorant to be criticizing the interior to be full of cheap plastics when you really can\\'t tell from one photo.i can see why honda is so popular, but it gets kind of annoying when fans of a certain type of vehicle seem to think they are something special because they can see \"high quality\" that apparently average consumers cant.bottom line - to each their own. my two cents, as always...-thene :sick:  \"What would you guys think if the 09 Fusion interior looked like this (with ambient lighting)?\"I never used to care for wood trim (imatation or not) years ago, but now I see it on many cars and sort of like it.The Ford oval is not to appealing anymore, or ever was, sorry to say. I have heard that younger buyers are not to thrilled with it either.I could do without the cup holders, I don\\'t believe food or drinks belong in a car.  EPA test of AWD Fusion is now at 17 mpg. Without AWD the V6 is at 18 mpg, which is exactly the same as the Accord. The Fusion AWD costs you about 1 mpg city and 2 highway, I think this is a pretty typical AWD penalty.Good post Jeffy. In retrospect, we should have bought an SEL I4 Fusion but this $27,105 MSRP baby was on the lot, in stock and had everything that we wanted on it.The difference between 14.8 mpg and 17 mpg is about $252 a year, based on 10,000 miles driven, our average, with gasoline at $3 a gallon.With the exception of the poor gasoline mileage, our Fusion is an exceptionally fine mid-size sedan. We enjoy it.  excellent report, thanks for that. That made for interesting reading because along with the Optima rental you also included some Fusion news in there, having driven both of them within a short span of time. Excellent.I\\'m not surprised by your report on each rig\\'s engines and their sounds at idle. The Optima\\'s engine must have some sound similarities to my Sportage 4X4\\'s. There were times sitting in the Sportage at idle that I truly did not know if my motor was running or not, it purred so quietly. Do report more review news on driving the Fusion, indeed, OK?I think this comment from targettuning sums some things up nicely.\"Since I have only had the Fusion a day or so I will form other opinions I am sure and I\\'ll let you know. But for now here is one. The Optima is a car where I was sure I was doing about 70 mph only to find I was doing 80 whereas the Fusion is one where I was sure I was doing about 70 mph only to find I was doing 60.\"  Well, then I have to say that I don\\'t give a rats tushie about transmission being manual or not. Either it\\'s a great interior with/without a clutch pedal or its not. And if its not then I\\'m not interested anyway.Different stroke for different people...  I didn\\'t say it had cheap plastic, I said it appeared in the picture to have cheap plastic, there is a difference. Obviously you can\\'t touch and feel the plastic in a photograph. The photos more recently posted look like graphics and computer generated images moreso than photos, and make the interior look much better. I don\\'t like light grey plastics, lighter gray tends to look cheaper in my eyes. The main thing that comes to mind now is, who at Ford let Volvo design the interior. :P That interior is VERY VOLVO, Volvoish, Volvoesque! Volvo\\'s have decent to good interiors, nothing wrong with that, but seems to be a copy of it.  Yes...to a small town north of Cinci. called Fairfield. All turnpike/interstate (Pa Turnpike to I-70 to I-71 and a short drive on what? I-215 maybe or I-245..I forget that one. But I-70 through Pa into Wheeling WV during a week day afternoon can be slow..ish considering on and off local traffic and the speed limit (posted 55mph) which I resolutely ignored as much as possible. Not so on the Saturday return when the road was vacant and I kept up the 75 mph pace...\"damn the torpedos, full speed ahead\"!!  The main thing that comes to mind now is, who at Ford let Volvo design the interior. That interior is VERY VOLVO, Volvoish, Volvoesque!You hit the nail on the head with that one! Just look at the new S80 and XC70 and you\\'ll see the same interior with a few minor differences. Compared to current Ford themes like the radio brick and plain buttons and knobs I\\'d say the Volvo look is a very good thing.  It seems like the conversation is about the Fusion, the Accord, and the Aura these days and the Camry, Altima, and the other entries are kind of peripheral to the discussion.I guess its a good sign for Ford and GM they are getting talked about so much.  I have seen you own a V-6 Fusion and wish you had bought the 4 cylinder version? Well, since I know you have read my observations \"Optima vs. Fusion\" which are both 4 cylinders I would tell you that if you want a quiet peaceful start from rest at each stop light/stop sign do not wish for that 4cyl. Fusion. While I suppose the induction noise and exhaust snarl are deliberate (they would almost have to be) they are very noticeable and get old fast and I\\'ve only had this car two days. By contrast, and as noted in my report, the Hyundai/Kia 4 cylinder is MUCH quieter both at idle and especially on acceleration light and heavy (the Kia makes some induction noise at heavy acceleration) where the Ford sounds like a 70\\'s muscle car with no air cleaner. Well, slightly overstated... but still!!!  well there\\'s no altima discussion because all the owners are out enjoying their new rides! when you have an awesome car like that, who wants to spend time talking about it when you could be DRIVING it! (i don\\'t really know why there\\'s no altima talk - i do see a ton of them here in central CT)-thene :P  Aside from my Optima verses Fusion comparison I OWN a 2006 Honda Civic, not in this class I know, but for general comments on Honda interiors and their quality here are mine:1. plastics on door interior panels scratch with a \"mean look\". Ours is criss crossed with fingernail scrapes and scratches gotten (sp?) while groping for the door pull which is unfortunately surrounded with the most fragile \"waffle\" pattern plastic you could imagine.2. Our car has 9K miles and the driver seat bolster has the pattern on the cloth fabric wearing off...going-going-soon to be gone in a 3 X 2 inch patch where our \"butts\" contact it on entry and exit. High quality? nope,don\\'t think so. Our 1995 Stratus seat fabric is not worn @ 187K miles..but it does have a cigarette ash melt mark.  Yes and what does it say about the Chysler Sebring (and Dodge ?) that it does not even make the list of models that are supposed to be the subject here?  I was wondering if someone was going to mention that.  Yes, but your Status\\' tranny bit the dust at 187K miles, complete failure. I\\'ll bet you $1,000 your Honda\\'s tranny lasts longer then that, with regular care and maintenance.  You should feel and touch an Audi\\'s interior sometime soon, it is a pleasure to be in that car w/o even driving it, which is the best part when you get to it. Whoever compared the Ford\\'s interior to Audi\\'s just insulted Audi tremendously. Even Volvo\\'s don\\'t quite stand up to Audi\\'s interior, I found Volvo\\'s nice but too \"minimalist\" in design.  Yes, but your Status\\' tranny bit the dust at 187K miles, complete failure.I\\'ll bet you $1,000 your Honda\\'s tranny lasts longer then that, with regular care and maintenance.Actually, not so much. Over in the 90-93 Accord repair forums, one of the failures is a \"flashing S\" which requires a new TCU, and there were a few transmission rebuilds. I don\\'t see this as a negative, of of these cars are on their 2nd or 3rd life, but no different than the Stratus.  Yes and what does it say about the Chysler Sebring (and Dodge ?) that it does not even make the list of models that are supposed to be the subject hereI believe the Sebring\\'s sales are 70% fleet/rental, which kinda means Chrysler\\'s folding this hand.  Chrysler even admitted it missed the mark with the Sebring and misjudged the competition and that it would be doing a total redesign asap.  ...it does not even make the list of models that are supposed to be the subject here?There are a lot of vehicles in this category that aren\\'t listed at the top. There is only room to list nine.As far as I\\'m concerned, any vehicle in this class is on topic here.  What would you guys think if the 09 Fusion interior looked like this (with ambient lighting)? I feel this interior layout works great for a vehicle such as the Flex, it has a sort of \"mature elegance\" to it. Fit and finish looks awsome and i like the substantial looking front seats and ice blue gauges. Im hoping the 09 fusion takes a different design direction, while utilizing some of the Flex\\'s theme. Give it a more modern, edgy, and high tech apearance to match it\\'s exterior.  The only car from this segment, and the least expensive car on the list. Family Trip picks. http://autos.msn.com/advice/CRArt.aspx?contentid=4024867&topart=passenger  If your family\\'s vacation plans this year include a road trip or two, it may be time to consider a new vehicle with the latest safety features such as curtain air bags and stability control. Yet the Accord doesn\\'t have stability control unless you get the V6. Maybe the article should have mentioned that. Oops.   Impressive. Very good company.  Yet the Accord doesn\\'t have stability control unless you get the V6.The point is, it was the only car in this segment good enough to make the top 10. Also the only one on the list under $30k.  I think the Avalon, Odyssey, and Sienna all can be had for under $30k. And the CTS lists for more than $30k but goes out the door starting in the upper 20s, in my town anyway.If I were going on a road trip, I\\'d take a roomier, less expensive sedan with more standard safety equipment and a smoother ride, e.g. Sonata, before the Accord. Or a minivan like the Odyssey or Sienna if I had more than 4-5 people. If I were renting a car for a road trip, the Accord would be far down my list--cars like the Avalon, Azera, and Lucerne are all more capable highway cruisers IMO.   Avalon, Odyssey, and Sienna all can be had for under $30k.I don\\'t think the models they were referring to were under $30k (Odyssey EX, for example).If I were going on a road trip, I\\'d take a roomier, less expensive sedan with more standard safety equipment and a smoother ride, e.g. Sonata, before the Accord.The (buoyant) ride of the Sonata would probably make me sea-sick after a while. Or a minivan like the Odyssey or Sienna if I had more than 4-5 people. Duh, I guess so.  Yet the Accord doesn\\'t have stability control unless you get the V6.The point is, it was the only car in this segment good enough to make the top 10. Also the only one on the list under $30k.But the mazda6 is the only car in this segment to get the Editor\\'s Most Wanted Under $25K by Edmunds whose editors seem to know quite a bit more about cars than the writers at consumer reports who have to test pop tarts and laundry detergent and then test cars when they have some spare time. I also think the editors and writers of Edmunds will tend to be more likely to enjoy driving and would be impressed by cars that are both comfortable when you want it, and engaging when the mood and opportunity arises which is why they chose the mazda6 over all the other cars in this segment. And the fact that it outbrakes the Accord by an average of over 10 feet according to major car mags is just a added bonus when it comes to safety. Of course it\\'s nice to get all these things while saving an extra few thousand dollars too...  Have you taken the Sonata on a road trip? What did you think? I\\'ve had it on several road trips and found the ride very pleasant.Actually, both the Avalon and Odyssey EX start under $30k MSRP. The Sienna XLE is just over $30k but under $30k after deducting the available-to-everyone $1500 rebate. The Accord EX V6 lists at $28k so there isn\\'t much difference between all those choices, including the CTS. Some on the list were a lot more than $30k of course. Who wouldn\\'t want to take an A6 or 5 Series or Infiniti M on a road trip?? Earth to CR: how about a reality check for people who don\\'t have $40k, or even nearly $30k, to spend on a car for the family vacation?  Earth to CR: how about a reality check for people who don\\'t have $40k, or even nearly $30k, to spend on a car for the family vacation? That is the top 10. You can get a V6 EX Accord for $25k easy. Not so, for the other 9. If you can\\'t swing $25k for the V6 Accord, you will have to settle for something in the top 15-20.   I just don\\'t think it\\'s fair that someone like us being criticized for having higher standard about the interior than the average buyers.Please define what you mean about it not being \"fair.\" How is your standard higher than others? All these mid-size cars have different interiors and just like exteriors, beauty is subjective. They\\'re all good, it\\'s just a matter of preference. I\\'m sorry to be a bit off topic but it irks me to see people continually saying \"that\\'s not fair\".  andres3 writes: I didn\\'t say it had cheap plastic, I said it appeared in the picture to have cheap plastic, there is a difference. and it all depends on what your definition of \"is\" is :P sounds like you\\'re splitting hairs there buddy, the differences in your comments are minimal. it\\'s hard to look at pictures to get a real good feel for things, particularly the quality of materials. pictures are good at giving an idea of design and flow, but lighting can be manipulated so things are highlighted that really aren\\'t in real life. ain\\'t nothing like the real thing...but all in all, add me to the list of people who think that the Accord has one of the nices interiors in this class. I did get a chance to sit in the Aura though, and I was very impressed. in fact I\\'d say that it would come a pretty close second...never thought I\\'d say that about a Saturn! personally, I\\'m glad the gap between the all too common camcords and the rest of the pack is closing... more competition will bring the best out to all our benefit. the trick will be getting consumers to have an open mind when considering more than the usual suspects.  Here we go. This CR report can lead into a whole new discussion about the objectivity of CR. (I quit reading CR 30 years ago because of what I felt was a big bias against certain manufacturers, so I can only go by what others say today about CR.)I\\'ve driven my \\'05 Sonata over 1300 miles from south Florida to CT in two days (just me in the car). It was comfortable and certainly not \"floaty.\" Drove it 40 miles each way to a golf course yesterday with 2 other guys, and our golf bags and other golf equipment in the trunk. Again, it drove and rode beautifully. My brother has an \\'07 Sonata and has taken a few round-trips of 300 to 400 miles. With 3 adults in the car and a few hundred pounds of stuff in the trunk (he\\'s a serious amateur astronomer), he raves about the ride and handling after every trip.  I\\'d have to agree the Sonata is not \"floaty\" by any stretch. Compared to say an Impala I had to suffer with, it has a much more advanced suspension in that it\\'s supple and firm. It handled the small to medium large bumps really well; composed and you felt a bump only once. On bigger bumps, I felt like there was more an \"event\", moreso than in my 6 which was surprising since the mazda\\'s ride is more firm. Maybe it was just I felt more of the bump through the steering rack, but on large bumps I definately felt more in the Sonata. And in cornering the Sonata had quite a bit more body lean than my Mazda, but then again, everything else in this class does. Compared to the Legacy, Accord and Altima (last gen), I think the Sonata had a bit more body lean, but still I had more confidence in corners than the Altima which just felt top-heavy and bloated to me. Really, the Accord and Sonata are about equal in terms of feel with the edge for taughtness and balance going to the Accord by a small margin.  Yeah, odds are I won\\'t have it that long but if I did and didn\\'t have the seats addressed I\\'d be driving on a seat with springs only...no fabric seat cover!!! And, as others have stated you are speculating about 180K miles into this cars future. Additionally, the 5 speed automatic transmission (for Civics) was introduced in the 2006 Civic and if it is as \"good\" as the overall car for 2006 I\\'d say it won\\'t. Need I say I am not in love with Honda after this experience....\"my first\" Honda.P.S. the Stratus transmission has an internal failure that placed it into \"2nd gear limp home mode\" but still has 2nd and reverse so not a totally destroyed transmission but one with \"issues\" as is P.C. these days   Consumer Reports has to justify their ratings, which are comprised of various acceptable and unacceptable and legitimate and illegitimate criteria. Argue all you want about what car is best, which tends to be a blend of subjective and specification issues. What is good for one is not good for all. But! I have rented several different mid-size models and I have extended family members that own an Accord, Sonata and Camry. Having rented a Grand Prix, Altima, Optima and 6 that pretty much covers the ball-game with the exception of the very competent Fusion and Aura. I was impressed with the powertrain and competent handling of the Sonata. Listen, I need a car not a (NAS)car or (Formula 1)car. I do want something that gives me bang-for-the-buck more than I need a badge that some need to escalate their image because their self-image is based on material possession and peoples perception of them. All of these vehicles had appeal. Dads Accord: 70,000 miles. Issues: one electrical issueMom\\'s Sonata: 40,000 miles. Issues: nilBro\\'s Camry: 50,000 miles Issues: nilThere wasn\\'t one rental I didn\\'t like. The Altima and Grand Prix were the best handling cars with the Grand Prix being the winner but having poor fuel mileage in the 2.5. The best all-round car I have rented in this class was the Altima. It was just a good handling, good riding and enjoyable car. Would I buy it, no! Why: I\\'m not convinced of parent company Renault and Father Ghosn\\'s approach to quality. It has gone down since I owned 2nd and 3rd Gen. MaximasIf I were buying a mid-size car, I would buy the Hyundai Sonata Limited. I had a an 07 Limited last week with gorgeous black leather interior and loaded. I was told I could buy one for $21-22k with rebates and discounts. Go drive anything out there for $21k and you wont get anything like Hyundai offers in the Sonata. See for yourself.  I meant Altima with 2.5 in my previous post. The Grand Prix engine and great handling was impressive. That car had appeal and balls. Not a family car tho with that back seat and high windows. My kids would complain they couldn\\'t see out.  While CR might not hold a lot of weight for you or me, it provides much useful input for a lot of people. The fact that Accord sales are through the roof and it consisently gets rated very highly in spite of it\\'s flaws, ie, expensive, no stability control, overrated, bad brakes etc. shows the general public does not have the same views as edmunds board hounds. It\\'s shows Honda has done it\\'s homework in this segment and gives the public what it wants and people will pay the price.  ...it does not even make the list of models that are supposed to be the subject here? There are a lot of vehicles in this category that aren\\'t listed at the top. There is only room to list nine. As far as I\\'m concerned, any vehicle in this class is on topic here. Didn\\'t really mean anything by that comment, other than I thought it was an amusing way to make the point that the Sebring is so bad that it is not discussed at all here. Maybe this is something everyone can agree on...that the Sebring is the worst in class :shades:  .  Save $5000-10,000 and settle for something in the top 15-20? Or pay around $25k for something like a Sienna, Odyssey, Avalon, or maybe an Azera? Sounds good to me!!   That\\'s cool. It just bugs me that in a class this broad we can only list nine of the relevant vehicles. I guess I need to make the point every now and again that we really aren\\'t limited to that specific list, just to the class itself - and I think we all know what vehicles fit and what don\\'t.But then again, we only seem to ever discuss three, four, on occasion five of them, so it doesn\\'t really matter then, does it? :shades:  Just saw a review of the Sebring vs. G6 vs. Mustang convertibles in C/D. Sebring was last. Again. G6 came out on top, due to its superior [non-permissible content removed]. (Uh, need to read the review to see what that means.)  Maybe, if you want to mix things up some, you could send a couple of the more popular ones off to another forum for a head-to-head discussion and ban them here  . A Fusion vs. Accord discussion, for example, could divert a lot of posts...of course, that would leave Mazda6 fans (like myself) free to extol its virtues here, while the Accordians would be banned :shades:  .  You don\\'t need stability control with the lighter, 4 cylinder Honda Accord, it\\'s light enough to have excellent handling, and not strong enough to get you into \"too much\" trouble.   Does the 4-banger Accord come with traction control?  Yessireebob, anything the Accord doesn\\'t have it doesn\\'t need. Got it.So when Honda added standard side airbags and curtains to the Accord across the line mid-way through the current generation, why did they do that when the Accord did very well without them for many years? I wonder what you\\'ll say when Honda makes ESC standard across the Accord line--which is inevitable.  Now your exaggerating. If the Accord doesn\\'t have something, it\\'s for a reason, just like the 140HP Civic doesn\\'t have the limited slip differential of the 197 HP Civic Si.It would be like putting a spoiler on an Elantra..... oh wait, Hyundai\\'s done that too! It would be like putting 245/40R18 wide big tires on a Sonata; it doesn\\'t need it. Now put those on a sports car, and you\\'ll get some nice traction and handling.  Let\\'s change them all occasionally just to drive members crazy.kirstie_hvisiting hostkeeping up the mantle of \"evil hostess...\"  Any car benefits from ESC. The only reason it\\'s not on the Accord I4 is to keep its cost down relative to the competition. Same reason Hyundai doesn\\'t offer ESC on the Elantra in the U.S. ... yet.  Any car benefits from ESC. Oh lets not start up with that discussion again. :lemon:  Good thought. But a) I already carry the mantle of evil hostess without making any special effort, just ask the people here , and b) they are already crazy, aren\\'t they? :P Just kidding, just kidding, just kidding!!! We is ALL crazy and we is ALL evil, yes?? :shades:   As a 2007 Accord LX 5-speed owner for 5 months and 6k miles now, I can respond to some of the recent comments about the Accord.Interior plastics- as targettuning mentioned, \"soft touch\" plactics do have a downside. While the Accord\\'s plastic feels wonderful and doesn\\'t scratch very easily, it has taken a few slight marks from my Labrador which the \"hard\" plastic in my old Ford easily shrugged off. It is a tradeoff between comfort and durability.Traction control (4 cylinder)- this isn\\'t really necessary once you get used to the car. I\\'ve gotten the hang of launching quickly but cleanly on dry surfaces, but wet surfaces are much harder. Basically, all most traction control systems do is cut power when wheelspin is detected, something I can do myself. Limited slip would be nice and would help much more, but also isn\\'t necessary in this car.ESC (4 cylinder)- I\\'ve tested the handling probably as far as I ever will and found it to be very satisfactory. However, I could see the value in having ESC there \"just in case.\" I had a 1991 Mazda 626 that did not have ABS, and got myself into a situation which ABS would have likely saved me from.  You are correct if the Accord doesn\\'t have something it is for a reason and the reason is... MONEY. They are cheaping out, leaving off useful..but non government mandated(yet)safety features. One can get a MUCH better equipped sedan for less. Same goes for the Civic. They are both priced at the ragged edge (upper edge)for their size class. Wave the Honda \"H\" at consumers and they are like Pavlov\\'s dogs slobbering to buy one based on previous reputation (deserved or not). I did. Same for used car buyers who would rather buy a used Civic or Accord with expired or nearly expired warranty (I know, never would be needed) and X amount of miles than a new \"something else\" that may have more comfort and safety features, no miles and long warranty (I know it probably will be OVER used). Bah!  \"You are correct if the Accord doesn\\'t have something it is for a reason and the reason is... MONEY. They are cheaping out, leaving off useful..but non government mandated(yet)safety features.\"Well, why did it take so long for Ford and Nissan to make ABS standard on the Fusion and the Altima? A few posters here have said that some consumers prefer NOT to have ABS. While I would not have forgone ABS on the Accord to save a few hundred bucks, I also would not have wanted to pay a few hundred more for traction control, either. I might have paid a few hundred more for ESC, but that is speaking for myself and others may feel differently.  Well, you have to remember that certain things in life are definite, and will happen no matter what.You might not ever need or use ABS. You certainly might not ever need or use ESC/ESP.You will always have peace and comfort of mind everyday you drive your Honda, knowing full well it\\'ll never leave you stranded.You will always enjoy the quicker acceleration up the freeway on-ramp and the more comfortable seats and interior quality. You will always enjoy not having to feel the car leaning at a big angle every time you take a turn at higher speeds. You will always enjoy superior transmission smoothness and fuel economy. Lets not overlook things that benefit you everytime you drive vs. things you may or may not ever need or use.   Traction control (4 cylinder)- this isn\\'t really necessary once you get used to the car. I\\'ve gotten the hang of launching quickly but cleanly on dry surfaces, but wet surfaces are much harder. Basically, all most traction control systems do is cut power when wheelspin is detected, something I can do myself. Limited slip would be nice and would help much more, but also isn\\'t necessary in this car.Wow, so what you are saying is knowing how to drive reduces your need for electronics that drive for you?  You will always have peace and comfort of mind everyday you drive your Honda, knowing full well it\\'ll never leave you stranded. This might be real or imagined, but the placebo effect is definitely measurable. Alas, in my case this was not to be, with the Accord being our record holder for number of times on a hook.  You sure some domestic vehicle manufacturer factory worker didn\\'t put sugar in your tank of that Accord?  Same reason, auto manufacturers fall into two basic categories. Those who voluntarily give consumers all the latest safety features without having to check option blocks to upgrade to the \"primo super bling\" model to get them (if available at all) or arm twisting by Uncle Sam. An example would be Hyundai. And then there are those who resist to the bitter end and money, aka profit, is usually the reason. Looks like Ford, Honda, Toyota, and Nissan, among others, might be examples of those  Every manufacturer is going to have some lemons. I also admit that the quality gap does appear to be closing. Hyundai is one I have been really impressed with lately, from reading reviews and reports plus having driven an Azera. However, they still have major problems convincing the public of their quality and adding value behind their brand name.From my experience and the experience of my immediate family, what makes the most difference between Honda/Acura and Toyota/Lexus versus some other makes is how the manufacturers and most dealers stand behind their products. I can speak on behalf of Honda and Toyota in that they really want you to be a satisfied owner.I can\\'t say the same for Ford, once again based soley on my personal experience. I don\\'t have any experience with Hyundai.  You sure some domestic vehicle manufacturer factory worker didn\\'t put sugar in your tank of that Accord?While my results might not be typical:Pretty sure...the fuel system...well except the main fuel relay that is designed to fail before 80k...has been fine. The radiator, suspension system (upper control arms, sway bar links), brake system (master cylinder, clutch slave) and engine electrical system (3rd distributor) have had issues though. I would say after 10 yrs/100k or so you are on borrowed time, so stuff that happens after that isn\\'t the car\\'s issue.On the up-side, 30 mpg in mixed driving on the last tank ain\\'t so bad. And again, I don\\'t think the car is that bad or anything, its just fun when the Honda sales guys would come over to help me out of my \"unreliable Ford\" when I was there to pay for the towing on the Honda.The Contour did leave me stranded once, for a $400 waterpump at 120k. Had this been a Honda, it would\\'ve had at least 1 $800 timing belt service by then where they would replace it anyway.  Hyundai is not reducing their profit margins by including all of these features out of the goodness of their hearts; they are doing so as a method to increase sales. They are still dealing with a bad reputation due to their past, as well as a somewhat down-market brand name, and their long warranty and high content for the money are meant to help overcome this.  Reference: ABS...ESC/ESP...traction control and toss in side curtains front and rear..active headrests too while you are at it. File under: rather have it and not need it than need it and, well, not have it. Close file. Please, enough with the Honda commercial already. The idylic eternal drive through the country side with sun shining and birds chirping. Honda\\'s will break.  Over the past two days, my wife and I have finally been able to go out and actually test-drive a few vehicles that she\\'s considering. The vehicles are listed in the order we tested them:\\'07 Altima 2.5S (6 speed manual with convenience plus package): To be totally honest, I was VERY surprised at this combination from Nissan. The interior is head-and-shoulders above the previous-gen, both in fit-and-finish, and the quality of materials. The seats were very comfortable, and there\\'s plenty of room for tall drivers like myself. The drive itself was excellent. The 4-cyl has more than enough go when it\\'s loaded with 4 adults and A/C at full blast. The 6-speed was smooth, and easy to modulate, as well as the clutch. The steering was a little light for my tastes, and cornering still isn\\'t close to the standard that the Mazda6 sets (IMO). All in all, a remarkable improvement from the previous-gen model.\\'07 Altima 3.5SE V6(6-speed manual with sport package): Yes, it\\'s 95 more HP than the 2.5, and yes, it\\'s noticeable especially during acceleration, but I still felt a little torque-steer here and there, and the difference between this and the 2.5 isn\\'t nearly as large as I thought it\\'d be. Yes, the 3.5 goes like stink, but the 2.5 is no slouch, especially with the 6-speed. Overall, it still felt heavy compared to both the 2.5 (obviously) and my Mazda6 (V6 with 5-speed manual), and the handling wasn\\'t there either.After both drives, my wife preferred the 2.5, for the gas mileage, the use of regular fuel, and the $4K price difference, which she feels that the 3.5SE wasn\\'t worth.\\'07 Ford Fusion SE V6 AWD: We didn\\'t drive it, but after sitting in it, my wife wasn\\'t impressed, saying that the interior looked and felt cheap. The SEL may have been better, but there wasn\\'t one in sight, so we left.\\'07 Mercury Milan Premier V6 AWD (with moonroof): Compared to the Fusion, this was MUCH nicer to both my wife and me. Better materials, fit-and-finish, and the overall layout was very nice. The drive was good, very good in fact. The ride was VERY smooth, and the power from the V6 wasn\\'t near the Nissans V6, but it still pulled well, even with AWD. And according to my wife and me, the NVH of the Milan was no better or worse than the Nissans.\\'07 Honda Accord EX (4-cylinder, 5-speed manual): Another nice ride, with great fit-and-finish, and quality materials. My wife wasn\\'t impressed with the controls for the radio and HVAC arranged as they were. The 4-cylinder performed well with the 5-speed, and was SLIGHTLY quieter than Nissans 2.5. The steering is too light and the brakes felt soft, but the handling was pretty good.So far, she\\'s torn between the 6-speed 2.5 (with it\\'s fuel economy and features for the price) and the Milan V6 AWD (for the nice interior materials and fit-and-finish, and the AWD). Right now, her biggest decider is whether or not she can trade in the fun of a manual for the AWD that is needed in this climate (driving through winters in upstate NY, with over 150\" of snow per year, and lake-effect events that almost happen instantaneously). And yes, she CAN have the best of both worlds with the Subaru Legacy, but we\\'ve yet to try it out, and plan to within the coming days. I\\'ll keep you posted.   And so the consumer wins anyhow regardless of motive. Wish I could say the same for the others.  Same reason, auto manufacturers fall into two basic categories. Those who voluntarily give consumers all the latest safety features without having to check option blocks to upgrade to the \"primo super bling\" model to get them (if available at all) or arm twisting by Uncle Sam.I think Toyota and Honda do a pretty good job as well, ABS is standard even on a Civic DX or Accord VP, as well as some of the Scions. I was impressed by that personally.It should be noted that GM made ABS standard on every vehicle they made in the 90s for a while but stopped doing it because the public said they would rather have an in-dash CD player :sick:  Not having a smooth shifting transmission won\\'t kill you--literally. Not having side airbags, or collapsible steering column, or ABS, or maybe even ESC could kill you, or a loved one. You might never use airbags or ABS or ESC--hopefully you won\\'t ever use them. But if you need them that one time and they aren\\'t there, you would surely miss them.The leather steering wheel cover and 8-way adjustable driver\\'s seat on my Elantra feel good every time I drive the car. But not having them won\\'t kill me.   ... with the Accord being our record holder for number of times on a hook.What? An Accord on a towing truck? Surely, you jest. Tell us more. I thought all Accords were invincible (even though I\\'ve previously read otherwise).  Honda\\'s will break. Honda\\'s what will break?  Well, why did it take so long for Ford and Nissan to make ABS standard on the Fusion and the Altima?ABS was always available as a stand alone option on any trim level of Fusion. IMO, any optional safety features ought to alway be made available as extra cost options on every trim level, without requiring other upgrades. In the case of the Accord, they have ESC available but only if you buy an expensive model.  You will always have peace and comfort of mind everyday you drive your Honda, knowing full well it\\'ll never leave you stranded. You will always enjoy the quicker acceleration up the freeway on-ramp and the more comfortable seats and interior quality. You will always enjoy not having to feel the car leaning at a big angle every time you take a turn at higher speeds. You will always enjoy superior transmission smoothness and fuel economy. Be sure to contact Honda so they can send the check to the right address...  Ah, maybe one,or more,of the thousands of bits and pieces designed and assembled by fallible (human) Honda employees. Even the occasional misbehaving robot welder or part handler.   Great post.Definately, get the manual!I wanted to look at the Altima 2.5 6-speed manual, but I knew that since it was a new design, I wouldn\\'t be able to get nearly as good of a deal as I did on the Accord (under invoice).  And yes, she CAN have the best of both worlds with the Subaru Legacy... She could also get that in a speed6, as I am sure you know.  We are NOT talking about manufacturers here. If you want to contribute to this discussion, please make your post specifically about one or more midsize sedans. Otherwise your post is going to disappear and if that continues to happen, your posting privileges are going to disappear.  ABS may have been available as a stand-alone option, but very, very few of the Fusions I looked at (and we are talking several dealers over several months) had the option, regardless of trim level.  I wanted to look at the Altima 2.5 6-speed manual, but I knew that since it was a new design, I wouldn\\'t be able to get nearly as good of a deal as I did on the Accord (under invoice). True, but the $22K sticker for the 2.5S was nice compared to the $25K sticker on the Accord, and it seems that the Accord dealer wasn\\'t nearly willing to budge, since the manuals \"are so rare\" and that was his \"last 4-cyl manual\" before the redesigned \\'08 comes out.  Since Honda paid for the transmission replacement in my Accord out of warranty, and then I turned around and sold it at 65K miles at 50 months old for 53% residual/resale value (including my tax, title, license costs originally), I\\'d say I owed Honda that nice endorsement of their midsize model, the awesomely amazing Accord.   Come down to where I bought my Accord... they now have a black EX sedan with tan cloth and stick shift, with a tag hanging from the rearview for $20,890 or something. Almost made me have buyer\\'s remorse on my LX...  Presumably this was a market based decision on the part of Ford and/or the dealers. Some people don\\'t want to pay $500 extra to have ABS, just as some do not want to pay $500 extra for ESC. You did have the option to order what you wanted or keep looking to find it. That is not the case for ESC on the Accord, if you wanted it you had to buy an expensive trim level.Don\\'t take this the wrong way. I am certainly not tryng to say Ford has a perfect record in this regard at all, but for this particular point about ESC in the Accord vs. ABS in the Fusion, Ford did the right thing and Honda did not.  She could also get that in a speed6, as I am sure you know. Oh yes, I\\'m well aware of it, as well as she is, but she doesn\\'t like driving my 6, saying it\\'s more of a sports car than a family sedan to her. I happen to take it as a huge compliment! Besides, 93-octane premium isn\\'t readily available near where she works, and she doesn\\'t want to drive a \"flashy\" car like the Speed6, since she\\'s an Assistant Principal at a High School.  Not having a smooth shifting transmission won\\'t kill you--literally. Not having side airbags, or collapsible steering column, or ABS, or maybe even ESC could kill you, or a loved one.Since pretty much every car since 1968 has had a collapsible steering column, I think we are good there. I am a big fan of ABS and think of it as a necessity, but as a stand alone option thats not terrible (although I mostly see it bundled with SABs, also probably not terrible).  Wait a minute, can you even get ESC in a Fusion?It\\'s not about trim levels or options in the Accord, more about engine choice; it is standard with V6 models. Honda actually considers the SE-V6 to be a lower trim level than the EX-I4. Both the LX and SE V6 models can be had for less than an EX-L I4 with nav.Couldn\\'t the fact that the I4 has better weight distribution and thus better handling have something to do with it?  ... they now have a black EX sedan with tan cloth and stick shift, with a tag hanging from the rearview for $20,890 or something. Tempting, but she doesn\\'t want black and/or a light-colored interior.  MZ6GreyGhost,That was a very informative post. Thanks. We have a 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion ($27,105 MSRP) and like everything about it, EXCEPT the very poor 14.8 mpg for in-city driving after seven months and 3,700 miles.The handling is great, in all weather, and it sounds as if you are interested in a \"snow-belt\" machine, so I would recommend the Milan, especially if you are not concerned about mileage.The revised EPA estimate for this power train is 17 mpg city; 24 mpg highway and we all know those estimates are optimistic.  ESC is not available on any trim level of Fusion.Once again, this is different from having it available but only if you buy $5000 in other options, that you do no want.  After driving the Fusion a few more days a couple of new things become apparent.1. I previously stated the Fusion was missing some nice touches the Optima had and used steering wheel radio control as an example. I have found a few more. The Fusion \"S\" dash/instrument cluster does not feature a handy menu of functions like: average MPG...miles to empty (current tank)...outside temperature...or even a dash display showing what gear it is in. Speaking of gears.2. the Fusion shift quadrant has only P..R..N..D..and L. No Hyundai/Kia Shiftronic manumatic shifter for sure. I am not sure what would happen if I shifted from D to L at speed. I suppose it would NOT go immediately into low..hah! I know these \"shift it yourself\" automatics may fall into gimmic land for some but even though I only used it once on our trip with the Optima (demonstrated its function for my wife)it is one of those \"nice touches\" in my book.3. I like the rubbery touch material used on the door panels and dash. The Optima had this material scattered around the interior too.4. I don\\'t like the very low and far to the left headlight switch and I don\\'t like the lack of \"auto-off/auto-on\" headlamps. The Optima low end model also had this.5. I continue to notice the engine induction noise and raspy exhaust and now think it is primarily induction noise. Very noisy throughout acceleration range.6. The Fusion has an Euro type short stick roof mounted radio antenna which seems to work well but the radio itself is not easy to use while driving (I know) with a lot of fussy buttons and controls and that lack of wheel mounted radio controls become even more missed. 7. For some reason the Fusion seem to be a more massive car to me. I don\\'t think it is physically much, if at all, larger than the Optima so why this would be?? Don\\'t know.So, while I like the sharp handling/taunt ride of the Fusion it is off-set by an immensely noisy engine.As of right now I would not buy the 4cyl for that reason alone. Taking a road trip tomorrow..fuel economy numbers to come as well as longer drive perceptions.  ABS and Traction control yes ESC no according to the 2007 Fusion brochure I am looking at.Traction control only on V-6 models N/A on any 4 cylinder model.ABS optional across all models and engine choices  Ah ha! at the risk of censure you did have a transmission failure then, at less than 65K miles? Somehow mine at 187K miles doesn\\'t seem so bad now. Still costly but no shame at those miles.  ABS and Traction control yes ESC no according to the 2007 Fusion brochure I am looking at.One of the Ford guys can correct me if I am wrong but I think the limitation is that the Fusion has 3 channel ABS vs 4 channel (it looks at the rear wheels together) so there is no functionality to individually control the rear brakes. I am not positive about this though.  So it is better for Ford to offer ABS as a standalone option on all trim levels, and not offer ESC at all on any trim, than it is for Honda to include ABS as standard on all trims and include ESC as standard on all V6 models???Anyways, doesn\\'t really matter, I\\'m off to the beach  So it is better for Ford to offer ABS as a standalone option on all trim levels, ...ABS will be standard on all 2008 Fusions and the government is mandating ESC beginning with the 2012 models, IIRC.  When Dodge pays for your transmission replacement out of warranty pigs will fly.Honda has already done the same for me and many others of that I am sure. I\\'d much rather have a transmission failure that is covered, paid for, (including rental car during the order/fix time) then have a tranny fail early in life (prior to 200K in my opinion), and have to either be out of pocket with the money or out of car!  Believe me... some of us appreciate your \"evilness\"!!  this is a little ridiculous. the fact that his car made it to 187k WITHOUT a transmission failure when yours only made it to 65k, and you STILL find away to make it look bad, and the honda to look great.I would guess at least 90% of people these days don\\'t keep their cars past 120k, nevermind 187k. so i would rather have a car that had NO transmission failures than a car that had a transmission failure, even if it was covered/partially covered under warranty.-thene :confuse:  I see you are not considering the MS6...you don\\'t want your wife to one up you with a better mazda6? :P just kidding, don\\'t think I\\'d like two of the same cars in my garage, just like I don\\'t like seeing too many of the car I\\'m driving around. Thanks for sharing your experiences about the other cars too. Since I know what you\\'re driving, I\\'ve got a pretty good idea of how those other cars compare now.  Yes, but no one wants, and no one will buy your car at 120K knowing full well that the tranny will die anyday now.Hence, no resale value. People know the Honda tranny isn\\'t gonna die again anytime soon, hence, the high resale value. So you might not keep your car past 120K, but are you selling it, or just keeping it in the backyard as decoration? Someone is going to want it at 120K, but not if it\\'s a domestic.  and the 187K figure for his Stratus is a world record, coming in second place for Stratus\\' worldwide is about 100K, then third place is down around 65K. So let\\'s not use this aberration of a figure.  don\\'t think I\\'d like two of the same cars in my garage, just like I don\\'t like seeing too many of the car I\\'m driving around. Yeah, this is part of what is keeping the Legacy off the list this time around. I like to have some variation in my life.  I don\\'t think that continuing to repeat these generalizations as though they are absolute facts 100% of the time is getting us anywhere that\\'s productive. Let\\'s move on, please.  \"Just saw a review of the Sebring vs. G6 vs. Mustang convertibles in C/D. Sebring was last. Again. G6 came out on top, due to its superior [non-permissible content removed]. (Uh, need to read the review to see what that means.)\"I really like the G6 over most midsized cars, and most auto magazines seem to like it also, but what I don\\'t like is that the Ecotech 4 cylinder is only available in the base model with an automatic. No manual transmission unless you go with the 3.6 L engine GXP model.  Because stick-shift rental cars aren\\'t very popular?  I\\'m not convinced of parent company Renault and Father Ghosn\\'s approach to quality. It has gone down since I owned 2nd and 3rd Gen. Maximas renault has almost nothing to do with nissan. mostly it consists of cashing a very large check each year equal to 44% of nissans profit, at least what they pay out as a dividend. they actualy compete against each other in most countries.as for quality, yea, it has dropped a bit. But, they\\'ve already begun correcting that. just opened a couple quality control centers recently.  The G6 convertible is okay but I am not too crazy about its interior. The biggest complaint over others I have is its trunk. With the top down, or up, there are hardly any trunk space available.I have not driven the Sebring convertible yet but between the G6 and the Mustang, I would take the Mustang convertible - personal perference.  Just when i thought GM was finally starting to get it right, i scramble upon this:The powertrain is similar to the Saturn Aura Green Line hybrid sedan, and new 2008 EPA figures have mileage rated at 24 mpg in the city and 32 mpg on the highway. These figures aren&#146;t as high as other hybrids, like the Toyota Camry, but it does achieve better mileage than the standard four-cylinder Malibu &#151; by 2 mpg &#151; while producing more power. While the 2008 Malibu will offer a six-speed automatic transmission for the standard gasoline-powered four-cylinder, the hybrid will feature only a four-speed automatic transmission.With only a 2mpg gain and an outdated 4sp auto this car seems doomed before it even goes on sale. Who is gonna pay a premium over a 4cyl malibu which only has 2mpg less than the hybrid and also features a 6sp auto?  I have been reading daily, but haven\\'t been posting nearly as much lately. Hope everyone had a happy 4th!  How many miles were on your Honda when the tranny quit?? How do people know that the replacement tranny (probably a rebuilt) won\\'t suffer the same fate in as many miles as the original tranny?  One of the Ford guys can correct me if I am wrong but I think the limitation is that the Fusion has 3 channel ABS vs 4 channel (it looks at the rear wheels together) so there is no functionality to individually control the rear brakes. I am not positive about this though. Correct. Two channels for the front and one for the rear. As posted by someone else, this will be addressed shortly to comply with Federal mandates.  How do people know that the replacement tranny (probably a rebuilt) won\\'t suffer the same fate in as many miles as the original tranny?And that would be around 130k miles which is past the extended warranty and less than andres3\\'s 300k mile reliable/unreliable line. :P No matter what we say andres3 is still going to think Honda will pay to replace that tranny after 130k miles, pay for his kids college education, pay for his retirement beach house, etc., etc. Just joking with you andres3. You\\'re passionate about your car and that\\'s a good thing. Just keep in mind that other people too, are passionate about their cars around here and we don\\'t all own Accords (Thank God!!! :P ).  So it is better for Ford to offer ABS as a standalone option on all trim levels, and not offer ESC at all on any trim, than it is for Honda to include ABS as standard on all trims and include ESC as standard on all V6 models??? What it is, is obnoxious to make a safety feature available only on higher priced models, for no good reason. It is unfortunate that apparently Ford chose not to design the Fusion with ESC availability in mind, which seems to be the reason it is not offered at any trim level, based on the 3 channel ABS comment someone made. It is obnoxious for Honda to design the Accord so that ESC can be available, but then say you can only have this great new safety feature if you pay up for a V6 that you do not want.Similarly, to the extent AWD is a safety feature, I think it is obnoxious of Ford to only have this available on the V6 models. OTOH, AWD is not available on any Accord so it was an accross-the-board design decision to not have AWD on the Accord which is different from saying you can only have it with some other upgrade.  I\\'ve used a couple of Sebrings for business travel. Can\\'t say they\\'re that bad. Performance is adequate with the 2.7 V6. The one thing they do very well - they get great fuel economy - consistently well above their EPA ratings.Regards:Oldengineer  Similarly, to the extent AWD is a safety feature, I think it is obnoxious of Ford to only have this available on the V6 models. OTOH, AWD is not available on any Accord so it was an accross-the-board design decision to not have AWD on the Accord which is different from saying you can only have it with some other upgrade.Jeffy,Some will argue about whether AWD is a safety feature -- it has no effect when it comes to stopping the car -- but it does improve handling in snow and on wet roads.There is a terrible gas mileage penalty associated with AWD. Our 2007 SEL AWD Fusion can only muster a very consistent 14.8 mpg in all-city driving, which is 95 percent of our travel. The car is seven months old and has 3,700 miles on it.In retrospect (hindsight is always 20-20), I wish we had bought an I4 with either a five-speed manual or a five-speed automatic, just for the gas mileage.The revised, 2008 EPA estimate for this power train is only 17 mpg city; 24 mpg highway. Heck, some V8 SUVs do that.I doubt if Ford\\'s 2.3-liter, 160-horsepower I4 has enough power to handle AWD. Maybe that\\'s why it is only offered on the V6.Electronic Stability Control will be mandatory on all 2012 models sold in the U.S., as per the government.  I would guess at least 90% of people these days don\\'t keep their cars past 120k, nevermind 187k. ... thene,That\\'s a safe bet. It\\'s also likely that mid-size sedan owners probably keep their vehicles for an \"average\" time and mileage, whatever those numbers might be, since mid-size sedans are sort of \"average\" to begin with.  There is a terrible gas mileage penalty associated with AWD. Our 2007 SEL AWD Fusion can only muster a very consistent 14.8 mpg in all-city driving, which is 95 percent of our travel. The car is seven months old and has 3,700 miles on it.I think the gas mileage penalty varies by vehicle. The Subaru Legacy with the 2.5 L 168 hp engine (yes slightly less than the Honda Accord but basically comparable) is rated at 22/30, while our wagon regularly achieves low 30s. The car has been phenominal in winter travels thus far, even just getting out of an unplowed subdivision is much easier.  I\\'ve never owned an AWD but have friends who have driven them for years. The all agree that AWD helped the car get going but it doesn\\'t do anything to improve stopping power or handling.The cars that run off the road during snowy conditions in CT are usually SUV\\'s. The drivers have a false sense of security, thinking AWD will keep their car under control.  Some will argue about whether AWD is a safety feature -- it has no effect when it comes to stopping the car -- but it does improve handling in snow and on wet roads.I actually think it is of limited value as a safety feature myself. I think ESC is much more effective and also costs a lot less both initially and in not having a gas mileage penalty. However, I have seen some data at iihs.org that shows somewhat better injury or death stats for the same car with AWD vs. FWD. Not much to go on as there were only a couple of models in the data that I saw.As for the power of the I4 being adequate, Legacy is about the same weight and has only slightly higher HP and torque than the Fusion.  I\\'m not suew what magazine Andres reads...but, the Sonata is right on paer with the camcord..in almost every category, except comfort and size, which is actually superior, As far as Looks go?,, its almost a clone to the accord, so if you think the accord is good looking, so is the Sonata..which looks extremly similar in looks. You need to read Car&Drivers take on the Sonata, as well as R&T Automobile etc...they seem to think its a fantastic car  What\\'s snow?Here in the Southeast there are lots of rain events that AWD comes in handy for.  I actually think it is of limited value as a safety feature myself. I think ESC is much more effective and also costs a lot less both initially and in not having a gas mileage penalty.I agree. I believe it is a positive thing that this technology will be mandated by the government for the 2012 models and beyond.Anybody know which of the mid-size sedans have ESC available now, even as an extra-cost option? Didn\\'t someone say it was an available option on the V6 Accord?  Andre doesn\\'t speak for the rest of us. I think the general feeling is that the Sonata is a competent car, but has its quirks and issues as much as any car out there. For every positive review you cite, I could counter those with many others that pull the Sonatafest back to earth.The Sonata\\'s obvious advantage is its price. But not every buyer is pleased with the total package, as evidenced by Sonata\\'s below average sales.The car needs some tweaks. So does the Accord. In 2 months we\\'ll be able to see how Honda counters this Korean competition that obviously wasn\\'t there when Honda last redesigned the Accord.  IIHS provide ESC infomation for the cars they have tested. Most of the cars discussed here are listed at:http://www.iihs.org/ratings/summary.aspx?class=30Where it is optional, this does not tell you whether you can add it as a stand alone option or if it requires other upgrades (such as the V6 requirement for the Accord...BTW, it is standard on their V6).  The cars that run off the road during snowy conditions in CT are usually SUV\\'s. The drivers have a false sense of security, thinking AWD will keep their car under control.Many SUVs have 4WD not AWD, a slightly different, more archaic system which requires manually activating the transfer case and second drive axle. I don\\'t think there is any requirement to have all the wheels driven for someone to be foolish with an SUV. There may be some self selection criteria in that demographic.In my experience, the first ones in the ditch after a snow are conversion vans (sometimes I think Ohio state troopers park vans on the side of the road at odd angles to remind people to slow in bad weather), followed by high horsepower rear drive vehicles. When I start to see cars discussed in this forum that don\\'t have southern/out-of-state plates in ditches, I get more concerned.And a small caveat, AWD will help with turning, as it transfers power to the outside wheels on a turn, providing better turn-in and rotation. It optimizes traction, as opposed to DSC which just lowers the limits of the vehicle.  I have been looking to purchase either a Legacy sedan or Accord. I believe that the 2007 V6 models on these two cars have ESC as a standard feature and that neither of the 2007 4 cylinder models have it. The 2008 Legacy is out now, and some 4 cylinder models have ESC (Subaru has a different name for it). The 2008 Accords won\\'t be out until probably Sept and I suspect that with a new design, ESC will be included with some if not all 4 cyclinder Accords. I read in CR that the Subaru stability control is \"slow to react\" so I don\\'t know how effective that system is. I\\'m waiting until the new Accords are out to make my purchase, and I still haven\\'t decided if I really need AWD. I hate to sacrifice the fuel economy if it isn\\'t necessary to do so.  It optimizes traction, as opposed to DSC which just lowers the limits of the vehicle.Is DSC (?) the same thing as Electronic Stability Control (ESC)?  This link gives the various names used by the different car companies for their ESC\">link title http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc_names.html  And a small caveat, AWD will help with turning, as it transfers power to the outside wheels on a turn, providing better turn-in and rotation. It optimizes traction, as opposed to DSC which just lowers the limits of the vehicle.That was my feeling when I had a Subaru Legacy and when I test drove the Mazdaspeed6... I could get on the accelerator right at the apex whereas in my fwd mazda6, I have to wait a little longer or I\\'ll have more understeer than I\\'d like to deal with. I do find that AWD does more than just help in wet or slippery weather; it also helps handling. As far as mpg is concerned, I did find that my 2.5 liter in my subie (an automatic) was a bit thirsty as I am now getting the same or better mpg in my v-6 mazda6 (manual tranny). I should note though, my friend with a 4 cylinder outback is getting better mileage than my legacy (which was a 96), so perhaps subaru has improved mpg on that engine.  Thanks. Very helpful.  I read in CR that the Subaru stability control is \"slow to react\" so I don\\'t know how effective that system is.  That might mean it is better from my perspective as a driver. I have read that some systems are overly invasive...was it the Sonata or Camry (or both) that some had commented about in this regard???We have a VW with ESC (they call it ESP). Theirs seems like a good system (not to quick to intrude) from our experience and from what I have read of it. I would guess that cars that are more oriented toward being a \"driver\\'s car\" will be more likely to perhaps have better (less invasive) systems. I would put include cars like the Mada6, Accord, and Fusion in that category and I guess Legacy is going more in that direction...but I guess we will see over time what type of systems they end up with. As ESC becomes universal, the differences will probably be highlighted in reviews...CR may have the opposite view from reviewers at Edmunds (for example) as to which systems are better.  You need to read Car&Drivers take on the Sonata, as well as R&T Automobile etc...they seem to think its a fantastic car I\\'m not suew what magazine Andres reads...but, the Sonata is right on paer with the camcord.Apparently he doesn\\'t read those magazines.The Sonata lost out in comparison tests to the Accord in both Motor Trend and Car and Driver. It didn\\'t come in last, but it wasn\\'t on par with Accord \"accord\"ing to the magazine testers.I\\'m not trying to say the Sonata is bad; it isn\\'t at all.  You need to read Car&Drivers take on the Sonata, as well as R&T Automobile etc...they seem to think its a fantastic car I just received the latest MT in the mail today and they have their long-term wrap-up of the Sonata in this issue. I haven\\'t read it yet but I did scan it and it seems that they think it is a nice car, not \"fantastic\" as you say. However, they do seem to think it is a fantastic value. And that is it\\'s key selling point IMO. For the record, I do like the Sonata but wouldn\\'t buy one for myself. Like the Fusion and Camry, no MTX with the V6.  Here\\'s a list of all 2007 vehicles sold in the U.S. that have ESC as either standard or optional. Unfortunately, it\\'s not 100% correct (e.g. says Elantra has ESC optional, which is not true for the U.S.) but it\\'s probably pretty close.http://www.safercar.gov/pages/ESC-EquippedVehicles-2007.html  Sonota also has the highest repair cost in the category, according to an article on MSN Autos. For example, a front-end collision was estimated to cost about $4K, significantly more than other cars in the category.  \"And a small caveat, AWD will help with turning, as it transfers power to the outside wheels on a turn, providing better turn-in and rotation. It optimizes traction, as opposed to DSC which just lowers the limits of the vehicle.\"Your statement is mostly incorrect. A 4WD system such as QuadraDrive can help with turning, because QuadraDrive can deliver almost all torque to one wheel (not counting when the transfer case is locked). And unlike AWD QuadraDrive can aid in slowing the vehicle down. AWD in general (not including SH-AWD) delivers power to front and rear to all four whells and does not help with turning because it can not compensate for wheels that slip. (excepting those cars, which have LSDs on the rear)DSC does not lower the limmits of the vehicle, it makes sure you don\\'t exceed the limits of the vehicle, which is a different story. In addition, it attempts to keep the car moving in the direction of the front-wheels by activating brakes individually on 4 channel systems. Something the driver cannot do.As far as what vehicles end up in the ditch, nobody is immune. The last two years of snow storms, I\\'ve seen Lexus, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Hyundai all suffering the same \"ditch\" or run off the road fate.Actually I posted a link about a Subaru-centric test of AWD cars, it\\'s an interesting watch. Murano AWD system was about useless, Subaru was about the best.  Sonota also has the highest repair cost in the category...That is incorrect, if MSN Autos was referring to the IIHS crash study done earlier this year. In that study, the Sonata did have higher frontal collision repair costs than most (not all) of the other cars tested, but it had relatively low rear repair costs, so its total repair costs were lower than for the Accord and some other models. Here is the original release from the IIHS:http://www.iihs.org/news/rss/pr030107.html  I do like the Sonata but wouldn\\'t buy one for myselfI think many others feel the same way. I got my eye on the Genesis and wonder when push comes to shove, I\\'ll actually buy the car instead of saying I like it, but end up buying something else.  DSC does not lower the limmits of the vehicle, it makes sure you don\\'t exceed the limits of the vehicle, which is a different story. In addition, it attempts to keep the car moving in the direction of the front-wheels by activating brakes individually on 4 channel systems. Something the driver cannot doWhat is the advantage of braking a single, totally unloaded wheel? Its too bad physics is no longer part of high school curriculum.  DSC does not lower the limmits of the vehicle, it makes sure you don\\'t exceed the limits of the vehicle, which is a different story. I think this is true for a good system. However, I gave up debating ESC issues here some time ago...As far as what vehicles end up in the ditch, nobody is immune. Perhaps, but the most amusing cases are those with 4 wheel drive SUVs, for a variety of reasons.  What is the advantage of braking a single, totally unloaded wheel?Why do you keep saying this? None of the wheels are totally unloaded unless they\\'re off the pavement. The inside wheels will have a little less weight than the outside wheels in a turn but they are nowhere near \"totally unloaded\".  Thank you for correct my mis-writing. It has the highest frontal-repair collision cost than most of the cars in this category. Of course it would have the lowest repair cost because items that get fixed under warranty with the Sonota are paid for by let\\'s say Accord owners. But that assumes things break on an Accord. And as another astute host(Shifty) has noted, people don\\'t buy on warranty alone, if they did car sales would be linked to those manufacturers with the highest warranty.  it makes sure you don\\'t exceed the limits of the vehiclemust, by definition, engage at some level lower than that. Otherwise it wouldn\\'t be a \\'safety\\' system at all, would it? Furthermore, our individual abilities to properly control a car at its limits will usually deteriorate as we age, meaning that my reactions, eyesight etc. etc. were all better 20 years ago than they are now. I was a more capable driver then, I am a better driver now. The point being that cars particularly within this category MUST have ESC systems set towards the \\'lowest common denominator\\' driver, that 80-90 year old guy, if you will. Lastly, how else do you explain, reductions in avoidance test capabilities, high speed swerve etc. etc. continually in cars equipped with ESC as opposed to that same car when (and if) the system is turned off. This is becoming a fact of life, so much so that even CR (somebody that obviously would figure to champion systems like this) has begun recognizing in their own tests that stability control does limit cornering/avoidance speed capabilities. Not to mention the enthusiast mags who obviously bump these \\'limits\\' on a regular basis and therefore have coined a term for it - electronic \\'nannies\\'.This is a dangerous trail we\\'re on, as we encourage some computer nerd and/or liability lawyer determine what you, I and everybody else is capable of behind a steering wheel. You don\\'t suppose that those same lawyers would be lined up for miles when my throttle is cut, my brakes are applied for me etc. (SC system controls are largely passive (not aggressive) in nature) and the car I\\'m in won\\'t allow me to avoid an accident (ostensibly because IT doesn\\'t think it is safe), while I think (of course) that I could have handled it quite nicely on my own), do you?  I think you have a misconception about this IIHS study on repair costs. It\\'s all about repair costs from different kinds of collisions. So warranties have absolutely nothing to do with it. It also has little to do with out-of-pocket costs, assuming someone has collision insurance with a a deductible under about $750. It could affect those collision insurance costs, of course--the study was done by an insurance industry group, after all.One of the interesting tidbits in the IIHS report is that some mid-sized cars like the Camry actually did quite poor on certain tests, e.g. the full rear-end test, when you look at how much damage they suffered, but because parts costs are relatively low for the Camry, the cost to repair the damage was not as great as for some cars that suffered less damage.I agree that people don\\'t buy on warranty alone. I sure don\\'t. But given the choice between two mid-sized cars that meet all of my other requirements, I\\'ll buy the one that has the longer warranty that matches my driving and ownership pattern best.  But given the choice between two mid-sized cars that meet all of my other requirements, I\\'ll buy the one that has the longer warranty that matches my driving and ownership pattern best.Does that mean you would choose a Sonata over an Accord, Camry or Fusion?   Why do you keep saying this? None of the wheels are totally unloaded unless they\\'re off the pavement. The inside wheels will have a little less weight than the outside wheels in a turn but they are nowhere near \"totally unloaded\".Then the vehicle is not cornering at its limit, so having something that intervenes at this point is certainly not raising the handling limits of the vehicle. On a stock, squishy car like the vehicles discussed here, there is enough body roll, weight transfer, and suspension travel that at the limit there is little or no weight on the inside wheels.I think DSC/ESC *may* improve the capabilities of certain drivers, but electronics can only compensate so much. It\\'s main safety feature is that it applies the brakes so at least the vehicle will be going slower at the point of collision.  Not sure if they have been posted.I personally like the 17s on the SEL models better...looks like these alloys come straight off the Edge.  No. My preference for my next new car is one that scores Good/Good/Good on the IIHS crash tests. None of those cars you listed do that as of now. But those 3 X Good\\'s are pretty rare, so I may have to give a little on that requirement. As far as the Accord goes, I don\\'t like certain aspects of it (mainly the feel-every-pebble ride) and it\\'s too pricey in this class. I don\\'t think the Camry is worth the price premium for what you get, and I\\'m not crazy about the styling. On the Fusion, I prefer the Milan, and I would seriously consider the Milan if I slip my crash test requirement. On the Sonata, I\\'d like to see what Hyundai comes up with for the 2009 refresh. Right now I prefer the Optima over the Sonata, but the IIHS side impact test for the Optima hasn\\'t been published yet.  The tranny never quit on me, but it started to display problematic tendancies at 42K. So I had it replaced with a BRAND NEW transmission assembly and it was warranted just like a new car purchase, from the date and mileage at install. So I was covered for another 36K, or in Honda\\'s case of covering problems out of warranty anyway, until 100K for all intent and purposes.It was an \"updated\" transmission assembly and had all the updates, and fixes already included. So the defect in the tranny was solved, and there is no worry for another 200K.  I judged only the 2002 or 2001 Sonata. I assume everyone will say that Hyundai has improved significantly with their Sonata since then, but they were so FAR behind back then in 2002 that they better have improved, or they\\'d be out of business.  That\\'s a remarkable account. Does Honda treat all of its customers that well or are you special? What\\'s the rest of the story?  So realize you judged a car that was designed in the mid-\\'90s and debuted in the U.S. in 1998. Yes, Hyundai has come a LONG way since then. The current Gen 4 Sonata is a much better car than the Gen 3 Sonata.  Yeah... that\\'s a helpful and productive post. :sick:  Well in a few years this will all be moot. There is no common denominator in DSC, it is how it is programmed, just like every other aspect of the car. Of course, DSC limits cornering, but it also helps avoid spinouts.The dangerous trail you mention has been this way for many years as almost every one of the systems in the car are programmed, by programmers.What do you do sue, if a loved one gets into an accident and dies because they turned off DSC and DSC could have saved their life. Do you sue the manufacturer for having an off switch?  Actually there is no misconception, the Sonota has the highest cost to repair in a front-end collision out of a number other competitors\\' vehicles.  Of course, DSC limits cornering, but it also helps avoid spinouts.This is exactly my point, it makes the vehicle \"safer\" for most, poorly trained, inattentive drivers by lowering the overall limits of the vehicle.As I was reading Grassroots Motorsports (one of the greatest car rags ever) there was an article on young people involved in autocross and other entry level events of driving skill. In one of the editorials, the author pointed out that you don\\'t \"lose control of a car, you give it up.\" Apparently, so many drivers are giving it up, we will now have a computer to take over.  eBay motors- Honda Accords, sorted by highest mileage, shows 18 cars with over 200,000 miles (excluding typos) out of 305 total for sale. Another 32 cars are 150 to 199k. Another 70 are between 100 and 149k. Nearly 2 out of every 5 Accords currently for sale on eBay have over 100,000 miles. That is right now.There is a 1991 Accord for sale with 341k miles, which appears to run and drive well.  not a bad looking car. need to take the bottom chrome off the front though, and better tail pipe finsihers. other than that, a very nice offering by ford  It would be my luck to buy one of those eBay Accords with 100,000 miles and have it implode at 100,001, right after I drove it away.I\\'ve owned many, many cars in my 49 years of driving but I\\'ve never owned one with 100,000 miles. My 2000 Ford Focus station wagon has 93,000 miles on it so it may be the first. That\\'s one of the reasons why we bought a Fusion for our mid-size sedan, good results with the Focus and with a 1997 Ford Thunderbird, 85,000 miles.Even so, Bender, your Accord research was quite enlightening. It would seem at first blush that the Accords take a lickin\\' and keep on tickin\\'.  It\\'s just a 2008 Fusion, which is the same, appearance-wise, as the 2006 and 2007 Fusions. No styling changes. But the renderings for the 2009 reveal quite a few changes, including the loss of the bottom chrome bars and a new taillight setup.I believe FoMoCo is serious about becoming a stalwart competitor in the mid-size segment again, as is GM. Chrysler doesn\\'t seem to have a serious contender in this category.   In one of the editorials, the author pointed out that you don\\'t \"lose control of a car, you give it up.\" Apparently, so many drivers are giving it up, we will now have a computer to take over.At the moment when the car is not going in the intended direction, it becomes a \"loss\" of control. Even the most highly skilled racing car drivers \"lose it\" and you sir, can too. And could one day be saved by a \"nanny\".   If it\\'s you and me on the road, and you give up control of your car, lawsuits and punitive damages (for you) are very expensive if you maim or kill me. Not to mention possible criminal charges. I would think you would want a DSC type system to save your bacon on the road. But I could be wrong. Anyway, in a few years it will become a moot point. If you buy a car after a certain point, you will have a DSC type system. Get used to it. Get a BMW to try out DSC, take a performance course at BMW Spartanburg so you know how it really works.  eBay motors- Honda Accords, sorted by highest mileage, shows 18 cars with over 200,000 miles (excluding typos) out of 305 total for sale. Another 32 cars are 150 to 199k. Another 70 are between 100 and 149k. Nearly 2 out of every 5 Accords currently for sale on eBay have over 100,000 miles. That is right now. Not sure what your point is? :confuse: If you look at MY 2000-2007 for the Accord and Ford Focus, which I assume the Honda fans consider the ultimate unreliable car, both have 14 listed on ebay motors with over 100k miles. I used those years because the Focus has only been out since 2000 and all of the over 200k Accords you mention are from the 80s or early to mid 90s. I\\'m guessing you could find the same cross section of any brand or model on ebay motors. So are we to believe ebay motors is proof of the Accords assumed reliability leadership?  Just asking. :shades:A quick check of the Taurus, all years this time, shows one for sale with over 200k miles and 63 more over 100k miles.  It would be my luck to buy one of those eBay Accords with 100,000 miles and have it implode at 100,001, right after I drove it awaysounds like you\\'ve bought off ebay before. :P seriously though, no way on gods green earth I go to ebay for a car. It no surprise over half the accords there are high milage. Its not a testament to the accord durability, (and it is a very durable car) but rather a testimonial to the crap you find on ebay.   In one of the editorials, the author pointed out that you don\\'t \"lose control of a car, you give it up.\" Apparently, so many drivers are giving it up, we will now have a computer to take over. At the moment when the car is not going in the intended direction, it becomes a \"loss\" of control. Even the most highly skilled racing car drivers \"lose it\" and you sir, can too. And could one day be saved by a \"nanny\". I have to say, I totally disagree with that statement, and that is why so many people refer to it as a \"loss of control.\" These are the same people that refer to crashes as accidents. There is a lack of personal accountability here, one doesn\\'t lose control, they give up control, most often because they lack driving skill. This is an issue with people driving a vehicle beyond their skill level, at which point it would be more effective to activate the brakes on all 4 wheels. There may be times when the car will not follow exactly the wishes of the operator, but that doesn\\'t mean or even imply that the driver has no control over the vehicle.Suddenly, if they say \"oh, it wasn\\'t my fault, I lost control\" that makes it all better.  OK, glad there is no misconception; I thought there might be based on your earlier posts in which you said the Sonata had the highest repair costs in its class (not true) and that these collision repair costs were somehow related to the cars\\' warranties (also not true). We are all copasetic now. :shades:  f it\\'s you and me on the road, and you give up control of your car, lawsuits and punitive damages (for you) are very expensive if you maim or kill me. Not to mention possible criminal charges. I would think you would want a DSC type system to save your bacon on the road. Yes, EXACTLY. If I give up control of my vehicle, I should be held liable for damages. Oh wait, that is how it works now (if you live in a real state that has real insurance, unlike MI and this no-fault farce) and that is why people have insurance. So you are telling me if we all have this nanny on our car, we won\\'t need insurance or lawyers anymore? Hmm that might get me to change my mind.   There may be times when the car will not follow exactly the wishes of the operator, but that doesn\\'t mean or even imply that the driver has no control over the vehicle.  That my friend is a \"loss\" of control. If you don\\'t have TOTAL control, you have LOST some control. You may be able to regain control, but it may be too late. It seems these \"electronic nannies\" can improve lap times for F1 drivers, but obviously these guys can\\'t hold a candle to your abilities. PLEASE. No matter how good a driver you think you are, you are human and can make mistakes. A \"nanny\" may save your life one day.  That my friend is a \"loss\" of control. If you don\\'t have TOTAL control, you have LOST some control. You may be able to regain control, but it may be too late.Control isn\\'t digital, its not something you have or you don\\'t. In racing, there are many times when you cannot get the vehicle to do exactly what you want, either because of picking a bad line, carrying too much speed, another vehicle in the way, etc, but amazingly, the driver can keep the vehicle on the road and out of anyone else\\'s fenders.There is no collision avoidance application in DSC. It lowers the limits of the vehicle to match the abilities of the driver. Is a car with lower limits safer in the hands of the general public? Probably. The original argument was if these systems would improve handling, and I think consensus is now that they won\\'t, although they may improve safety.It seems these \"electronic nannies\" can improve lap times for F1 drivers, but obviously these guys can\\'t hold a candle to your abilities.While I appreciate your acknowledgment of my incredible driving prowess, I would also like to point out that the systems used in F1 (since they are definitely applicable to mid-sized sedans) can vary suspension rates as well as pre-load the sway bars. That, my fellow Honda loving friend, would improve handling. This is not such a new concept, Citroen did it on their mid-sized sedan in the 60s, and a number of vehicles have used electronic systems to vary the amount of dampening. The systems being discussed currently will just brake.Vehicles like the BMW 7-series (just for you kdshapiro) have electronically adjusted sway bars that can limit body roll and weight transfer. Given the weight of the BMW is about 2x that of my Accord, I think the car handles remarkably well, and this electronically adjusted suspension is a big part of it. Will your $18k Accord have the same system as the $100k BMW, I am gonna guess no, but I think I was wrong before once or something :P  Yes, I would say you\\'ve been quite enlightened, as thinking 85,000 miles is a good experience, is a direct shame on the American car industry.That is setting the bar, way, WAY TOO low.Good results for 85K and sold for good resale, or 85K and you met a repair bill worth more than the vehicle?  thats where you loose any pretense of objectivity andre, and why people think of you as a paid honda representative. j/kNobody here doubts that accords last long, hold up well, and suffer relatively few major problem. Nobody really argues that. But to say domestic cars only last 85k is just nonsense, and everybody takes your opinions and post with a grain of salt. I\\'ve owned many a ford and a chevy or two that has gone far longer than that.  While I appreciate your acknowledgment of my incredible driving prowess,You obviously have an over-inflated view of your own driving abilities. Highly skilled (and handsomely paid) drivers can \"loose control\" and hit the wall, but I guess they are all beneath your skill level. I bow to your greatness sir. Why have I never heard of you? :confuse: Is your last name Montoya?  I was nothing special to Honda, other than being a younger man up and coming in the world with a lot of future vehicle purchases in my lifetime to come. It was my first Honda, that 2003 Accord. I don\\'t think it\\'ll be my last, at least not my family\\'s last as my wife has gotten two Civics in a row, three if you count the used purchase of the 92 Civic, (the 05 was totalled by some bad driver in a 2004 Jetta). I would assume Honda treats all of their customers at least as good as they did to me, but I was somewhat aggressive and demanding with my dealer. They can\\'t say no if you don\\'t ask. It\\'s when they say no and you\\'ve asked politely that you should get mad and raise hell. Looking back, I should have gotten a big sign and picketed the Dodge dealer right in front of them on the sidewalk until they offered to pay for my AC repair and head gaskets, and auto tranny, and 15 other things. Alas... I didn\\'t take the time or think it might work, howeverI have a coworker that told me he picketed Carmaxx in front of their sales lot, and after about day 5 doing it, everyday for all day, they caved in and bought back his 10 month old Windstar sp?? Ford for 100% of his purchase price. The only conditions they gave him for buying it back at full price were that he never shop or buy from CarMax again    You obviously have an over-inflated view of your own driving abilities. Highly skilled (and handsomely paid) drivers can \"loose control\" and hit the wall, but I guess they are all beneath your skill level. I bow to your greatness sir. Why have I never heard of you? Is your last name Montoya? You have never heard of me because my name isn\\'t in the papers because I don\\'t hit the wall. :P Okay okay, I am taking this less seriously than you, I apologize.My point is that DSC as it applies to relatively inexpensive mid-sized kid-hauling grocery getters is not going to increase the handling capabilities of the vehicle. It is going to lower them. Are lower handling limits safer for most drivers? Probably. Is having a \"nanny\" react because the driver gave up going to help? Probably. Would actually teaching people how to drive help? Probably.  A quick check of the Taurus, all years this time, shows one for sale with over 200k milesLOL. And 1 single lone Taurus over 200K miles for sale is equivalent to the 18, count them, eightteen Accords with over 200K miles for sale how? Actually, there are 15 on Autotrader right now...maybe they don\\'t put the Tauri on eBay because they can still retail them, while the high mileage Accords like mine are Craigslist or eBay only.  It was my first Honda, that 2003 Accord. I don\\'t think it\\'ll be my last, at least not my family\\'s last as my wife has gotten two Civics in a row, three if you count the used purchase of the 92 Civic, (the 05 was totalled by some bad driver in a 2004 Jetta).Hmm 2004 Jettas had stability control...   This was once a comparison of sedans. Now it seems to be a comparison of 15 year old brand reliability and stability control chat.What happened to comparisons of the new Altima and Camry, Fusion and Aura, et al? :confuse:  Even if every driver was as highly skilled as lilengineerboy  , ESC would still be a good idea, IMO.  Unfortunately, there\\'s not much \"meat\" to the forum anymore.  NEW midsize cars only, or am I welcome to discuss the finer points of the early 90\\'s Accords and Camry\\'s?  I\\'m not sure (that\\'s the host\\'s call). It just seemed like a lot more people would look here to compare the current vehicles, since cars like the early 90s Accords weren\\'t even midsize cars.I\\'m not the forum police though, and you may certainly take any and everything I say with a grain of salt.   Good results for 85K and sold for good resale, or 85K and you met a repair bill worth more than the vehicle?Neither, actually. We still own and drive the 85K T-bird and the 92K Focus in addition to owning a 2007 SEL AWD Fusion with 3,700 miles.  I have got to say that I really like the new Accord sedan.From what I\\'ve seen so far, it\\'s probably the boldest Accord sedan since the 1986 \"flip up\" lights Accord. It\\'s good to finally see a real grille on the car for once. And I\\'m particularlly fond of the side profile with it\\'s chrome accents. I\\'m finally glad to be able to say I find the Accord as attractive as the Altima and Mazda6 and that it doesn\\'t look nearly as horrific (forgive me current accord owners) as the 03-05 models (06-07 look a little better than 03-05s IMO)Can\\'t wait to see pics of the interior and offical photos from Honda.  I know it\\'s just an 06-07 type model. It\\'s the 2008 Apperance Pkg model with the 18 inch wheels. I think I saw a post here (or somewhere) asking if anyone had seen the new alloy wheels that will be offered with that package and since i saw the pics, I thought I\\'d post them.  Funny you should pick Taurus to point out how poor domestics are. Directly prior to purchasing the 95 Stratus from my daughter we owned about, lets see, 7 Taurus/Sables from 1986 to 1988 model years. All bought used. The longest lived was the 1987 wagon sold two years ago this Thanksgiving. It had 293,435 miles when sold and I still see it occasionally on the road around town. Yes, it did have a reman. transmission installed @ around 190K miles. Yes I did repair/replace things on it in the 13 years I owned it (from 132K miles to 293K miles). The next was a 1987 LX sedan that was sold to a friends son @ about 190K miles. It NEVER had the transmission replaced up to the point he was rear-ended at around 200K miles thus ending the cars useful life. The last higher mileage was a 1986 Sable wagon that went to 150K miles. Original transmission replaced @132K miles...salvage yard replacement lost reliable OD and was not remaining in it when sold. All had the \"Vulcan\" V-6 and NONE required any engine work (except water pumps, alternators etc) and NONE used oil or ran poorly regardless of mileage. I spent $$ on most of them for mostly normal repairs. Some had odd things go wrong and some (one comes to mind) was a money pit that vexed me until I repaired/replaced almost all electrical items e.g. power window motors..pwr. lock actuators...AC problems...auto climate control etc. but ran flawlessly otherwise.  Every time I see this:I think this:With some of this:I want to see it in person first. I thought the Altima looked terrible in the \"early\" photos but I really like the way it looks in person (and the coupe looks great). Honda usually doesn\\'t go too crazy so I want to see it in person before I make a judgment.  LOL. And 1 single lone Taurus over 200K miles for sale is equivalent to the 18, count them, eightteen Accords with over 200K miles for sale how? Once again, missing the point and spinning it around to favor your favorite car.Listings on Ebay, autotrader, or whatever are not ways to measure reliability or durability. Once those 200k+ Accords sell you may see more Tauruses with 200k+ miles listed. Should I call USA Today so they can start printing the story now? :sick:  I have been noting my perceptions on a 2007 Fusion \"S\" 4 cylinder 5 speed automatic. Originally I was comparing it to a 2006.5 Kia Optima since I almost literally jumped out of the Kia into the Fusion. Now as I have driven the Fusion more and on a weekly repeated trip of a little over 300 miles I will say more.1. The initial observation of a noisy engine (induction noise as opposed to mechanical clanks) remains. It also has, I believe, raspy exhaust but I can\\'t hear much over the engine.2. After driving in the Allegheny mountains I confirm initial observations of sluggish acceleration/ and or slow speeds up those mountains with the same four adults (less luggage) as was in the Optima last week. The Optima fairly flew up those same mountains and remained in at least 4th gear whereas the Fusion needed a downshift to 3rd to maintain speed once gained ( and that seemed to be more of a struggle).3. I find I dislike even more the high rear package shelf/trunk as time passes. Sometimes when I crest a hill the car behind me is momentarily lost from sight as the rear rises on the downside of the hill. Additionally backing into a parking stall is difficult when you cannot see \"behind\" well. 4. The car feels larger than it probably is..upright and tall like a Ford crossover SUV. It feels solid (5K miles however) rides firmly and corners and tracks pretty well also. 5. Now for fuel economy. 345 miles @ 13 gallons = 26.538 mpg. This was unlike the trip using the Optima so I won\\'t directly compare to it but it WAS typical of a week-end trip using our 1995 Dodge Stratus...same terrain, same route, same speeds, same load (4 adults no luggage). The Stratus for those who do not know has 187,500+ miles a 4 speed auto 2.5 liter V-6 (164 hp) which compares favorably with the 4 cylinder/5 speed auto Ford. The Stratus generally gets the same/similar or a bit more mpg on these trips (around 27.3- sometimes as much as 28 mpg). I have used it week in and week out for more than a year on this same exact trip so I have more experience with it but I am not really impressed with the Fusion so far. A Hyundai Sonata 4 cylinder/4 speed auto (2006) rented for the same trip a few months ago got (as I recall) about 29.something mpg.I don\\'t know that the V-6 Fusion would do any worse on this type drive. If you factor in the apparent laboring engine of the 4 cyl. in the mountains and additional gear (6 speed auto). I have never driven the V-6 model but since I have this trip every week I might strongly consider it over the 4 if I were to buy a Fusion/Milan. Conversely since I AM considering a Sonata I wonder (after having rented both 4 and V-6) if I really, really need the 6. The 4 cylinder in that car and the Optima is perfectly satisfactory..quick even..on my typical weekly trip..mountains included and seems to get better fuel economy (even the V-6 Sonata got about 29 mpg)!  Listings on Ebay, autotrader, or whatever are not ways to measure reliability or durability.But I think they do provide some indication as to how common getting to 300K miles is...and all indications are 300K mi is not common at all, on any car. Which I think is something that most rational people already realized  .  C\\'mon, folks. Several of your fellow members have urged on-topic conversation. It\\'s not hard - the clue is in the discussion title.  So far, I\\'ve been seeing 28 mpg city / 34 mpg highway in the Accord, average of 30, without even trying to maximize economy (quick starts and heel-toe downshifts in the city, and 70-80 mph highway).After reading an article on MSN about \"hypermiling\" (using various methods to greatly increase economy), I\\'m going to use this tank of gas to test some of the theories. Most of it is common sense, i.e. avoiding quick starts and excessive idling while stopped, no more than 5 mph over speedlimit or 55 mph, etc. Also, not giving it any more gas on hills, just keeping the throttle open to the same amount as on flat ground, and letting speed fall some. Some of it has surprised me... The last mile of my commute home, if I slip into neutral at a certain point, I\\'ll only have to give it five short pulls from 2,000-2,500 rpms to get into my driveway. The rest of the time I am coasting along just fine at idle in netural. It is also surprising to me how keeping the revs down below 2,500 makes acceleration seem excruciatingly slow to me, yet none of the other traffic seems to mind at all. I don\\'t get passed by many people, and still leave some people behind.A few of the theories are pretty wild, such as shutting of the engine at stoplights and on long downhills, drafting 18-wheelers, etc. I won\\'t be going crazy here, just trying some of the easy stuff for one tank of gas, at least 80% city, to see how much of a difference it makes. Has anybody already tried anything like this? What do you guys think, will it make any difference and if so, will it be worth it? I think I\\'ll see some substantial gains with the coasting. Also, the Accord is the perfect car to try this with, as I can keep the VTEC on the \"economy\" profile.   I AM considering a Sonata I wonder (after having rented both 4 and V-6) if I really, really need the 6Can\\'t speak on the Sonata 4 cyl, but the Accord 4 cyl is a strong, peppy, marvelous piece of machinery which is hard to beat.  Has anybody already tried anything like this? What do you guys think, will it make any difference and if so, will it be worth it?I would guess you\\'re late to work every day.  It\\'s set up for hybrids, but you might check out our Hypermiling discussion.  I, for one think much of this has become a \"game\" for the participants. Not so much in managing fuel economy as bragging rights. Also, most of their moves seem downright dangerous to me. I would not attempt most of the things they do....not worth my life for whatever fuel economy gained. Oh, coasting seems harmless enough but what if a powered move becomes necessary? By the time one realizes they are in neutral and remembers to engage drive the need for the powered move has passed..to what harm?? Not for me!  So far, I\\'ve been seeing 28 mpg city / 34 mpg highway in the Accord, average of 30, without even trying to maximize economy (quick starts and heel-toe downshifts in the city, and 70-80 mph highway).Every time I read a mileage report I get nauseous. That\\'s because no matter what we do our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion only yields a constant 14.8 in all-city driving after seven months and 3,700 miles.The revised EPA estimate (always optimistic) for this power train is 17 mpg city; 24 mpg highway. We did take one 360-mile trip with this car and it averaged 26 mpg going and 24 mpg returning driving 65-75 mph.Technicians at our dealership checked the car over with a computer at 1,500 miles and said everything was according to specifications; they found nothing to be \"wrong.\"Our terrain is flat. The climate is moderate (air conditioner now in use all the time). The tires are slightly over inflated to 35 psi. My wife and I are conservative, gentle drivers.Every visit to a gasoline station, every two weeks, makes me cringe and causes me to wish we had purchased the I4 with either the automatic or a five-speed manual. The fill-up experience occasionally makes me wish we had bought an Accord, too.We like most everything about the Fusion, EXCEPT for the crummy mileage. I have nicknamed the car \"The Guzzler,\" because of its poor mileage.  Since I am now driving a rental 2007 \"S\" model 4 cylinder/5 speed auto Fusion for an undetermined length of time it would pay you to read (and heed maybe?)some of those observations I am posting. First, and maybe foremost to you would be the excessive engine noise followed closely by fuel economy which at 26.5 highway is unremarkable among similar sized 4 cylinder (and some V-6) competition. This week I will be driving around town and to/from work (small city suburban driving) where the Stratus routinely gets 22-23 mpg. I\\'ll post what the Fusion gets under those same conditions. You state you had wished you had purchased the 4 instead..as I have frequently been told \"watch what you wish for.\" The 4 cylinder version seems to me to be sub-par as compared to both the Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima in some categories (noise,standard features and fuel economy at least)...undoubtedly, as many will chime in, to the Accord/Camry 4\\'s as well. I have no real axe to grind against Ford either..just calls \\'em as I see \\'em.  Listings on Ebay, autotrader, or whatever are not ways to measure reliability or durability. Once those 200k+ Accords sell you may see more Tauruses with 200k+ miles listed. Should I call USA Today so they can start printing the story now?Exactly, baggs. It\\'s just as scientific as deciding which is the best car from 40 consumer reviews at the top of the page. \"Well, car X is rated 9.2, and I like it a lot, but car Y is rated 9.4, so I guess I\\'ll buy that one. It\\'s clearly the best car.\" That would be a pretty proposterous proposition(pardon the allitteration!)The Taurus, while not exactly competitive in its last few years, did prove to be of at least average reliability by many accounts.Seems like if I were choosing a domestic to be a bad example of reliability, I would\\'ve gone with a 90s Chrysler anyway! :P  I found this on another forum. I don\\'t know the source.June 2007 Retail Sales (excluding fleet sales).43,000 Camrys vs only 9,100 Fusions! 1.Camry 430392.Accord 274983.Altima 216814.Impala 165265.Sonata 109176.Fusion 91027.G6 69498.Legacy 62699.Sebring 374010.Aura 358111.Passat 324912.Malibu 324313.Mazda6 218514.Milan 214415.Galant 195416.Avenger 170117.Optima 1466  We\\'ve seen the interior of the Ford Flex and speculated that the \\'09 Fusion will get something similar. I have to beg to differ now though. Seems to me it will get something more along the lines of the \\'08 Focus and Escape interior. See the pic below and note that you can opt for a navigation system in the Escape or the Sync in the Focus, both of which replace the standard radio controls with a 9 inch touch screen unit. The dual zone climate control readouts are in the screen on top of the dash. It\\'s actuall kind of nice when you see it all lit up with the temps and such. Multicolored and different fonts/sizes to help with interpretation.2008 Ford Focus interior.Escape with navigation.  The Focus interior looks very Mazda3 with the display at the top of the center stack instead of with the radio. From a usability standpoint, it makes sense because the display is much closer to the road so in theory it should result in less eyes-off-road time. The downside is when you separate controls from their displays, there are mapping issues and those might be even more prevalent with sync and its capabilities. I think they just expect the driver to use the steering wheel controls.  Not necessarily. The Focus and Escape interiors were done prior to Fields taking over and from what the insiders tell us the Flex interior is closer to what we\\'ll see on the 09 Fusion (with adjustments for cars vs. CUV, etc.). Remember the Flex will hit the streets next summer before the 09 Fusion.  I\\'m surprised at your low highway MPG. I averaged about 32 mpg in automatic mazda6 I4, which is the same engine. This was over a 1600 mile round trip at about 72-77 mph most of the time and A/C on part of the time.I\\'ve been getting 23-25 mpg in my normal suburban commute...speed on my route varies from about 30 to 60 mph with an average speed around 40-45 mph. There are quite few stop lights but no congestion. I think the I4 sounds great, at least in the Mazda variation. I don\\'t feel there is excessive engine noise at all. I could do with somewhat less tire noise than the Mazda has on some pavement, though.  the altima was at 25,935, and the accord was at 28,900 (surprisingly, down 14%), the camry was at 46,630, and the fusion was 12,425. also down from last year.the two that are really surprising are the altima and camry. even though fusion and accord sales were down from last year, both companies saw solid growth in their compact cars, (both focus and civic were way up)which probably explains the drop. but corrola and sentra sales were also up significantly.  in this era of $4 gas, pretty much all mfgrs. of smaller/economical sedans should see increases. The Altima has been a solid #3 for some time now and is further reinforced by its update, the Accord is an outgoing design and should be \\'suffering\\' at least until its redesign, while the Camry is well, the Camry.  I think the altima was the most striking, sales figure wise. the camry growth can be attributed to the hybrid version. but the altima saw a 77% increase from june 2006. they didn\\'t sell enough coupe\\'s to attribute it to that. and actually, that was the fist decline in the accord in a long time. Have the rebates stopped or something? seems they were keeping the sales going strong for most of this year.   Well, as I said since this was the first time driving the Fusion on this particular trip. And I can\\'t comment on an extended drive as yours that probably included a lot longer time at cruise speed on an interstate/turnpike. I can, however, equate this car to others including my own (the 95 Stratus and a 2006 Civic) on this re-occurring trip that follows the same route..speed (more or less) and load week in and week out. I was somewhat surprised by the fuel economy but I knew about what was coming by the amount of fuel left (per the dash gage)upon return home. Also, I don\\'t really know what Ford was thinking leaving the amount of induction noise intact when designing this. I have not encountered this much noise on a new car...ever! Yeah, there is muted intake/induction noise on other brands but this seems to have been left intact to simulate \"sportiness?\" maybe. It really is unrelenting unless you absolutely are on cruise with no additional acceleration needed. But, accelerate for any reason and it becomes evident again. This may be pleasing to some but it is annoying when it drowns out the radio (low volume to be sure).  As an addendum I have researched the hp/torque figures on both the Stratus 2.5 V-6 and the 2007 Fusion 2.3 I4. As follows:1.) 2.5 Stratus V-6. 164 hp 163 lb./ft.torque.2.) 2.3 I4 Fusion 160 hp 156 lb./ft. torque.3.) Stratus weight...approx. 3180 lb.4.) Fusion weight..unknown at this point but possibly something very similar.  Fusion weight..unknown at this point but possibly something very similar. Yep, it is 3101 pounds with manual, according to edmunds, then add about 75 pounds for the automatic and it is right there with the Stratus. 75 pounds is the added weight for automatic, based on Mazda6 brochure I have.  While this car isn\\'t within this size class (and therefore not to be dissused here) I think this is interesting. I had occasion to rent a 2006 Chevy Impala to make \"the trip\" about a month ago. It had the base 3.5 liter V-6 and 4 speed auto. At the end of \"the trip\" the fuel economy readout said....29.4 mpg. I believe this to be due,in very large part,to the gearing..approx 1600 RPM @ 72 mph.  Ford has suffered on fuel economy because Bill Ford\\'s mandate for the last several years has been emissions. Ford has a V6 Explorer that puts out less emissions than a Prius, yet they never advertised it and the public never seemed to care. I always thought that was the wrong focus but it seemed to be a personal thing with Billy. Now the gloves are off and we\\'ve seen a hint with the new Taurus having a mileage increase while adding 60 hp with the new 3.5L engine. I expect mpg increases across the board for all the new stuff starting with the 09 models.  Oh, coasting seems harmless enough but what if a powered move becomes necessary? By the time one realizes they are in neutral and remembers to engage drive the need for the powered move has passed..to what harm?? Not for me!It\\'s a manual, I wouldn\\'t shift an automatic into neutral while cruising.My last automatic... if I was cruising along in gear and decided I needed to make a \"powered move\" and punched it, I would get... nothing. The car would hesitate for a moment as if to say, are you serious? Then, the revs would fall as it shifted out of the gear it was in and worked its way down... when it found the gear it wanted, wham! the revs would shoot way back up, and acceleration would begin. Even if I forget I\\'m in neutral, I can shift into gear and get going as quick as an average slushbox can react to your right foot.  In a perhaps more controlled test, EPA has 29 mpg highway for the Fusion I4 and 28 for the 3.5L Impala. So they are close on the highway. Difference is only 2 mpg in the EPA city test.Also, I beleive in contrast to your results...in the March 2006 issue CR measured 32 mpg highway for the I4 Fusion (milan, actually) and the sonata 4 cyl was measured at 33 mpg highway in that same issue.  in my V6 Accord. And I drive with a lead foot and at 80 MPH when I can and traffic will allow me to. Also I drive in heavy traffic often. On long trips I\\'d easily hit the EPA estimate of 30 highway at 80 MPH.  Yeah, you know the often used phrase...\"results may vary\" is true. I try to maintain 72 mph on the Pa Turnpike on all the cars I travel in, rented or not. Then on the more rural stretches of 2 lane in Bedford and Somerset County Pa. I am constantly aware of the deer population even during the daylight. This past trip we saw 3 doe with 4 fawn in the middle of the afternoon. At night things get worse + bear + bobcat so all kinds of wildlife is around. I hit two deer last fall so I am especially aware with a rental. As a result I drive moderately especially at night. It would be safe to say my driving is about as sedate as possible off the Turnpike. So fuel economy should be at its best as far as speed is concerned..BUT factor in the mountainous stretches and economy falls to some degree or another.  ..BUT factor in the mountainous stretches and economy falls to some degree or another. We traversed the PA TP (worst road in the world I say) from Pittsburgh to Lancaster two weeks ago in our \\'06 Explorer. Just under 22 mpg for the trip which was 95% highway, 70-75 mph, A/C on all the way, and CC on most of the way. I thought that was pretty darn good. Now we\\'re back to 13 mpg for our 90% city commute where you have to start from full rest on long steep hills. I think that\\'s where mileage suffers, not on highway hills.  Altima RecallUh oh, not good for Nissan.  Uh oh, not good for Nissan. Replace the air filter and add a screen. I\\'d say that is a very minor recall.Not even close to \"sludged engines\" or breaking camshafts or having to replace engine coils.  yea, a $6 air filter isn\\'t really that big a deal. every car gets recalled for something. this is about as minor as it gets  Apparently, cars with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder have an air filter that can cause some serious problems. It seems that if something hot is sucked into the filter, like ashes from a cigarette, it can catch on fire. Four incidents have already been reported to Nissan.Uh, yeah, replacing an air filter is no biggie but the reason behind that isn\\'t so \"minor\" as it seems.  1/10th as much as a single problem that isn\\'t admitted to across the board.I know from reading MSN\\'s user reviews that everyone had the same problems I did with their domestic, (well, okay, not all, but many). Dodge never admitted to any wrong doing or recalls. What a sham!  its still minor. so far, .003% of the cars sold have had a problem. deffinitly not minor if you one of those 4 people, but for the 139,996 whose car\\'s didn\\'t suck something hot up the air intake and cause the air filter to catch fire, not that big a deal. no worse than the 165,000 accords that were recalled in march because of an engine problem.  Sounds trivial to me. I can\\'t recall the last time I drove through flames or burning embers. The closest I came was 18 years ago a foreign car pulled out to pass in front on my on way home with wife from day surgery at hospital. Apparently he gunned it or something as he changed lanes in front of me (I was in left lane). IT blew up as he pulled into my lane spraying engine parts and oil and coolant all over my car. Pieces looked like rods. But no flames. Next time, who knows. :blush:  My thoughts exactly. Even the rear of the new Accord is similar to the Saturn L-series. Having disliked the current Accord, I had high hopes for the 2008 model. Unfortunately, I the new design is among my least favorite of the midsize segment. I hope that it looks better in person.  I\\'ve owned many, many cars in my 49 years of driving but I\\'ve never owned one with 100,000 miles.***Meh. My 1975 Volvo 164E? 230K. My 1990 Volvo 240? 270K. My Toyota 4-Runner?(currently running) 345K and still going. 4 cylinder Toyotas are as close to indestructible as it gets.Oh - and I had a couple of Buicks at 150K+ before I got rid of them.  What year , make and model had that unresponsive slushbox tranny? My \\'05 Sonata with automatic tranny is responsive. I haven\\'t driven the latest generation Sonata, but my brother says his \\'07 Sonata SE has plenty of juice at any speed.  Lead foot doesn\\'t mean dink if you are on highway run. Once you\\'ve attained the speed it doesn\\'t take much to maintain the speed. A long steep hill will affect it some, but nothing like accelerating from 0 to 60, regardless of how easy or hard one is on the gas.  On my last longish trip going through very hilly parts and going 85 most of the way, I got 28 mpg so getting 30 mpg in an Accord shouldn\\'t be considered that big of a deal.  so, with 20,000 miles and after driving it for 18 months, my car is worth MORE THAN WHAT I PAID FOR IT (using their suggested retail price)!!! And private party value is about $2200 less than what I paid for it. Some were saying resale value is mostly dependent on what car you buy...I would suggest that this piece of information indicates that price paid is a bigger factor. So when a car can be had at a great price (I\\'ve heard of Mazda6\\'s selling new for $6k+ below msrp), resale value as a percentage of price paid will be much better than brands who charge a premium for their product. But I should mention that this info is not too important...I plan on keeping this car for quite a while since I really enjoy driving it. For my tastes, it\\'s still the best mix of practicality, attractiveness, performance, safety, and value in this segment.  Why wouldn\\'t somebody just buy a new one like you did and get the better price?I wouldn\\'t put a whole lot of anything into KBB or NADA etc. Your car is worth what someone will pay you, and that could be a lot less than you think.  so getting 30 mpg in an Accord shouldn\\'t be considered that big of a deal.I get at least 30 around town in my 06 I4 Accord with a manual. I\\'ve only had a couple of tanks of gas that got 29. Highway is always well above EPA.  you assume that buyers are logical and know how or are willing to do even basic research. a friend of mine who just bought a used xterra spent about as much as a person who could have gotten a new one with more than just 600 miles left on his warranty. why? who knows... but probably he saw the car and justified in his mind that buying used was saving him a lot of money when it wasn\\'t. of course, I didn\\'t have the heart to tell him that he paid too much, but it just goes to show there are a lot of buyers of used cars who don\\'t pay a lot of attention to the prices of new ones. all they see is the big difference between msrp and what KBB says and think they are saving a lot. I\\'m not saying it\\'s fair that I could sell my 18 month car with only a 10% reduction in price (using KBB\\'s private party value for my car), but that\\'s the way they price it and I\\'m surely not compaining. But if I were to go back on the market to look for another car that could take the twisties like a mazda6 and could also hold a coffee table fully assembled in the back and look good doing it, I\\'d be buying another Mazda6.  I\\'ve had three midsizers over 100,000 miles, a 1991 Mazda 626 DX manual, a 1990 Accord EX automatic, and a 1998 Mazda 626 ES-V6 manual. (actual photos below- better pics and more interior pics coming)See more Car Pictures at CarSpace.comSee more Car Pictures at CarSpace.comSee more Car Pictures at CarSpace.com  I think the only car in the fleet that didn\\'t do well over 100k was the \\'83 Reliant. If the Caravan hadn\\'t been exactly the right vehicle at the right time, I think Chrysler would\\'ve been off the list. That said, that minivan was fantastic in every way including reliability and durability.Everything else was somewhere between 140 and 190k.  Boy, that sure is a lot of motoring. Apparently you hold onto your cars for quite awhile, too. That\\'s one way to get your money\\'s worth.   exactly, car resale values whether it be through a dealer or private party will always be related to what a new version costs on late model cars, and the reason why those values tend to plummet when a particular vehicle starts being rebated and/or sold with bought down finance rates. The KBBs and NADAs of the world have a tough time with current real dollar values esp. at the point that the mfgr has to offer those rebates and other \\'deals\\' to clear their inventories. The only time that I\\'ve seen a car \\'appreciate\\' after purchase is when it is hard-to-get and/or in very high demand (the Prius and the Mini come to mind) exactly the opposite of the situation with have with any of the cars in this group (to varying degrees).  I don\\'t think the \\'09 F-150 was before Fields though and it has an Escape/Focus like interior in this spy shot.  Boy that is one ugly dash, don\\'t care what it is from. :sick:  Actually it was done BF (Before Fields). He took one look at it and sent the designers back to the drawing boards - for sheetmetal changes. I don\\'t think they changed the interior.  They may want to rethink that then or at least do what GM does and offer two interiors. IIRC one of the comments I read made the point that work gloves won\\'t be able to push those tiny buttons. That person is very right.  It\\'s possible they\\'re changing the interior, too. Then again - this is the F150, not the Superduty.  I just think its funny that you guys (not necessarily you captain) keep talking about cost of ownership, which uses KBB #\\'s for depreciation, and saying how an Accord is so much better, but then when I show you that my Mazda6 has very little depreciation from what I paid for it you then say that KBB is not credible. So which is it guys?!?! You guys should do the budget for United States...all smoke and mirrors.  These numbers come from another forum. I am not aware of the source. Believe these are figures for June.Check out these % retail figures. Nearly 80% fleet sales for the Avenger and a dismal 63.5% fleet for the Sebring.

In my case I\\'ll likely keep my car for more than 10 years, so it does not really matter, anyway. But even after only 3 years, the difference is about $1000. I think there are very few people who did not save well over $1000 by buying a Mazda6 instead of a comparably equipped Accord.  One note on fleet sales - you really need an entire year\\'s worth of data since rental fleet sales especially tend to go in cycles and are not evenly distributed through the year.It is interesting data nonetheless.  Good point, Allen.   The only midsizers with significant reviews (over 100) on Edmunds with a score over 9.0 out of 10 leaves you with only two choices:The overpriced AuraOr the bargain basement (right now) 2007 Accord  What is that box thing on the top with the red thing that looks like a plunger? (\"Box thing, \"red thing\" and \"plunger\" are, of course, technical terms. )  What is that box thing on the top with the red thing that looks like a plunger?Ford and other mfrs tend to have big red plunger looking things in their test mules. I have no idea what they are really for but I\\'m guessing that they are some sort of kill switch in case something goes terribly, terribly wrong. :surprise: You would think it would do something cool like explode spy photographer\\'s cameras or something but obviously it doesn\\'t.   Maybe it causes smoke bombs to go off to give a screen for the car to escape the papparazi\\'s cameras.  ( on midsized sedans) assuming a properly installed factory option...... I\\'m getting a lot of conflicting information.  I would think it would improve MPG over no deflector with the sunroof open and reduce MPG over no deflector with the sunroof closed.The desirability is that it can reduce wind buffeting while still allowing additional ventilation.  Wrong. A lot of the ratings have been refreshed for the 2008MY, thus you see few number of reviews for many cars listed here. For 2007, a good amount were over 9.0 and at least 100 reviews.FYI - these reviews represent a tiny sample of the population.  Yep - it cuts all power to the car instantly to avoid damage. It\\'s rarely used but I guess it would only take one time to make it worthwhile.  there sure seems to be a correlation between those cars that hold value well (and those mfgrs. having some financial problems) vs. % fleet sales, isn\\'t there?  Oh okay - my naivete. Never heard of that.It reminded me of those cartoon plunger TNT things (was that Wyle E. Coyote who was always doing that? Am I telling on my age?? ) so I started to wonder if it would blow up the car itself, but I was afraid someone might think that was a partisan comment, which it wouldn\\'t have been, so I didn\\'t. :P  it cuts all power to the car instantly to avoid damageahh yes, a stability control system   Edmunds hasn\\'t caught up with the effects of that absurd 4 grand rebate yet (and 5 years from now). But you are right about one thing, if you are one of those few people that keep a car for 10 years, the more rebate (and the cheaper) the better.  The only midsizers with significant reviews (over 100) on Edmunds with a score over 9.0 out of 10 leaves you with only two choices:The overpriced AuraOr the bargain basement (right now) 2007 AccordOr you can test drive these cars and buy what you like and form your own opinions instead of being herded around like a sheep. BAAAAhhh!!!  Thank you Captain Obvious.Why do you think GM and Ford are cutting back on daily rental fleet sales (GM still has a ways to go but Ford is getting there).One thing to remember is that fleet contracts are usually for a specific number of units done months in advance. So if a vehicle\\'s retail sales volume falls from the previous year then the percentage of fleet sales will go up even though the actual number never changed from what was projected.  your previous point about monthly numbers being a \\'snapshot\\' is likely right on - think a good portion of these fleet sales has to do with overproduction and inventory levels as well as \\'slow\\' retail sales. So therefore, these percentages should go up and down except in those cases where the mfgr. (by policy) doesn\\'t get involved too much in fleet sales. The unfortunate is that for some of these mfgrs., cutting production to match sales is easier said than done.  I put 332,300 miles on my \\'03 Sonata. Before that, I put 200,000 on my Caddy Sedan Deville, before that, 264,000 on my Crown Vic, before that, 250,000 on my Volvo wagon, before that 224,000 on an Escort, before that, 298,000 on another Escort, currently have 68,000 on my 07 Sonata since mid November...there were many more cars but I won\\'t list them now...now that\\'s some motoring. :shades:  actually, 18 months ago, I had 4k worth of rebates so mazda incentives have been around for quite a while. the fact that these rebates despite being around for many many months aren\\'t reducing the resale in Kelly Blue Book suggests that a heavily discounted car can help protect a buyer from really bad resale values. Either that or a Mazda6 is like wine...it gets better with age :P Or perhaps it speaks to how boring most of the midsize cars have become. I think I\\'ll stick with my original theory... those who have decided to buy a used car don\\'t usually do a lot of research as to what kind of discounts were available when the car was originally bought. I know many people who have bought used cars that were just a couple thousand of what they could have gotten new with much lower interest rates and a longer warranty. Granted, these are a saleperson\\'s dream, but being in sales for quite some time, I know that most consumers are not very well researched and if you try to help them get informed their eyes glaze over. Which is probably why a manufacturer\\'s reputation plays such a big role when it comes to buying cars despite the truth that the reliability between manufacturers differ by only a couple percent over five year periods for most cars in this segment according to consumer reports and JD Powers.  I put 332,300 miles on my \\'03 Sonata. Before that, I put 200,000 on my Caddy Sedan Deville, before that, 264,000 on my Crown Vic, before that, 250,000 on my Volvo wagon, before that 224,000 on an Escort, before that, 298,000 on another Escort, currently have 68,000 on my 07 Sonata since mid November...there were many more cars but I won\\'t list them now...now that\\'s some motoring.Holy mackerel, you aren\\'t kidding. I can\\'t imagine owning a car in the 3s, and I\\'ve had cars in the 2s already. That is some motoring.  I, for one think much of this has become a \"game\" for the participants. Not so much in managing fuel economy as bragging rights. Also, most of their moves seem downright dangerous to me. I would not attempt most of the things they do....not worth my life for whatever fuel economy gained. Oh, coasting seems harmless enough but what if a powered move becomes necessary? By the time one realizes they are in neutral and remembers to engage drive the need for the powered move has passed..to what harm?? Not for me!Target, I made a short video to show the techniques I\\'m using to test the max fuel economy of my new Honda (basically slow accelerations with 2500 RPM max, letting speed drop on hills, and a lot of coasting). As you\\'ll see, they aren\\'t really dangerous. I\\'m keeping up with the slow lane of traffic most of the time. Watch how when I coast, the cars next to me keep going only to have to slam on their brakes shortly after to reduce speed down to the limit or to stop.I this true \"hypermiling\"? Maybe. Will I see results that are worth the effort? I don\\'t know. Is driving like this fun? Not really. Will my next video be more exciting? I hope so!The video also shows how smooth and quiet the car is, for those who don\\'t care about fuel economy. Turn up the volume and you can hear the turn signal and barely hear the engine.Maybe when I\\'ve burned this tank of gas and thus finished this little experiment, I\\'ll make a video of a full acceleration run so everyone hear can see and hear that experience.Link to video on CarSpace  those who have decided to buy a used car don\\'t usually do a lot of research as to what kind of discounts were available when the car was originally boughtthis may be true depending on the acumen of the buyer - but also it is true that the vast majority of later model cars are traded in or sold to dealers not sold \\'private party\\' and certainly not at anything close to KBB \\'retail\\'. Those folks will know precisely what you or anybody else likely paid for a car - it is their business to know, and they will base anything they would pay for your car based on that. Rebates do, in fact, reduce any car\\'s resale values as well as its initial cost. Even sold private party, banks have things called \\'loan values\\' that would protect them from loaning too much, so therefore, the chances are that even if you can find somebody to pay a few thousand more than what your car is really worth, the guys with the checkbook are not likely to go along with it.The whole concept of ever getting even close to what you paid for an 18 month old car that is not in high demand anyway, just doesn\\'t happen! But you are welcome to believe your KBB/Edmunds/NADA \\'retail\\' values if you wish, or you can fall prey to that oldest trick in the book, and let the dealer sooth you with a high trade-in allowance on an overpriced newer car.  since you\\'re such an expert on car resale values I\\'ll just call you :surprise: . do you think Kelly Blue Book gives prices that would make the reader happy? and who do you think actually buys Kelly Blue Books? since dealers would be their biggest group of customers, wouldn\\'t Kelly Blue Book be more inclined to print values that are more favorable to them? the point is, Kelly Blue Book is often used as a referrence by buyers, banks, and dealers not because it is often wrong...but because it gives a good guide as to what the market will bear.the biggest thing is, you don\\'t know what I paid for my car nor the discount I got on it. if you are assuming that I just got the 4k rebates and that\\'s it, you\\'d be wrong. so my argument still stands... if you get a good deal on a car, that will help make depreciation much less of an issue (though to be sure, buying a new car should never be considered an investment). losing 10% in value (based on private party value by KBB) for a Mazda6 that I bought 18 months ago and have put 20k miles on it is amazing which is probably why you\\'re doubting this. but believe it or not, Mazda6\\'s can be had for amazing deals which is probably why the #\\'s are what they are. in the end though, I like my car way too much to sell it even if the resale value is awesome. it\\'s just another thing to be happy about my Mazda6.  the resale value is awesomeMazdas, in particular, have no history of \\'awesome\\' resale values although I believe that they will generally hold better than essentially the same car with a Ford logo on it. That \\'Japanese car\\' perception perhaps. Furthermore, the 6 has not been showing anything remarkable from a reliability standpoint, I guess giving some creedance to the thought that they can build \\'better\\' cars in Mexico (the Fusion) than they can in this country (the 6)?  ALG (Automotive Lease Guide) has some good info on depreciation. ALG Depreciation RatingsThey seem pretty accurate to me, with a few small surprises, but then again I\\'m no expert.Click on the press release link for more information about the ratings.  thanks for the reference - and a good reason why the lease cost and/or the cost-to-own something like a Camcord can be LESS than other \\'cheaper\\' cars.  Edmunds hasn\\'t caught up with the effects of that absurd 4 grand rebate yet (and 5 years from now).No offense, but I\\'m gonna go with the opinion that edmunds knows more about average car prices than you do.There has never been a $4000 rebate on the 2007 Mazda6. The largest rebate has been $2000, so far and is currectly at $1750. Some (but not all) buyers, such as myself, have gotten well below invoice less the rebate...we will experience even less depreciation than the average buyer. Right now edmunds gives a TMV of $18,736, including the $1750 rebate, on my exact car. For the comparable Accord the TMV is $20,614. These figures represent the average buyer\\'s price. The difference is $1900. So my point stands that there are likely very few people who did not save well over $1000 by buying a Mazda6 instead of a comparably equipped Accord...and are likely to experience less depreciation cost (measured in dollars) in the Mazda6 than they would have in the Accord.  Looks like they are using the same data as I am, the press release says: The ALG&#153; Depreciation Ratings will incorporate ALG econometrics and Edmunds.com\\'s \"True Market Value®\" .This rating is most certainly based on percentages. Using the edmunds figures in my previous posts the Accord is predicted to depreciate less in percentage terms, but the Mazda6 is predicted to depreciate less in terms of dollars.  I just looked on CarMax (they don\\'t negotiate price, right?), every 2006 Mazda6 in my region is priced higher than what I paid for my 2007. The closest is a base model (so less equipped than mine) priced at $250 more than I paid.  the 4k number (actually $3750.00) comes from post 3206 and is confirmed by zzoom\\'s claims on what he actually paid for his car quite awhile ago. Since I have not shopped the 6 personally I can\\'t confirm or deny either claim - if true, though , a 20% up front discount on a $20k car puts it about 10% under \\'invoice\\' before the haggling even starts and further will have negative effects on its value down the road. Therefore your $1000.00 savings (should be more than that when compared to even the outgoing \\'old\\' Accord/the \\'new\\' Camry or Altima) may not be savings at all.  Note that I said there has been no more than $2000 rebate on the 2007.I am not going to debate you, I will continue to stick with my belief that edmunds (and carmax) know more about what cars sell for than you do.  priced at $250 more than I paid.guess CarMax either thinks (or knows) that there are just bunches and bunches of idiots out there? Maybe there are - but in the case of any reasonably intelligent buyer thinking of spending maybe $15 or $16k on a car, I am sure as hell going to go look at new ones, get this \\'great\\' price and then run on back to CarMax and tell them they are asking a few grand too much. Wouldn\\'t you?  Carmax had several used 2006 Accords on the lot for more than I paid for my brand new 2007. And of course, their prices are \"no haggle.\" Does that mean their high-priced Accords won\\'t sell? Of course they will. Would that be a good deal for the buyers? Only if they are happy with that price.I think the important aspect of TMV and ALG ratings is that they use AVERAGE transaction prices. Some people here got great deals on Mazda6s and Accords, but we are in the tiny minority... I bet more people paid closer to sticker.  $250 more than I paid is still $2250 less than what the average buyer is paying for a new one, per edmunds TMV. Many people will be satified with a newish used car, if they believe they are saving a couple thousand bucks over new. The point is that the average residual value that edmunds reports may still be correct, even if it seems to you to be too close to what some buyers paid for a new Mazda6.  $250 more than I paid is still $2250 less than what the average buyer is paying for a new one.It is really hard to find anybody that doesn\\'t like to at least think they got a better deal than somebody else. This a function of all our egos, and $2200.00 is a lot of extra discount on a car that you are contending that everybody else is paying that much too much for. Suggest that there is more to this story, perhaps a unusual color, option combination, a demo, something that had been on the lot too long, or even a special order car that the dealer already had some money on. If you are going to assume Edmund\\'s TMV (and resale estimates) are even close to accurate (a real stretch IMO in these days of outlandish rebates), then your purchase price seems even more unlikely.  None of your speculations are correct. The edmunds TMV is what it is, I see no reason to believe it is any more inaccurate for a Mazda6 than it is for an Accord. There is nothing unusual about my car and it had 7 miles on it. There is also nothing that unusual about the price I got, a number of people have gotten similar or better deals, while others have paid significantly more. The fact is that the Accord\\'s higher resale value is offset by its higher purchase price. It does not matter how you figure it. If you start with invoice less rebates, rather than TMV, for the models I looked at that will still show the Accord at about $2300 more than the comparable Mazda6. This is more than double the difference in edmunds predicted value after 3 years. If you don\\'t believe that the initial purchase prices are affected by expected future values, then you must believe that only Accord buyers know about their higher resale values. One who is buying a Mazda6, Ford Fusion, Sonata, or whatever is just as likely to be aware of the higher resale values of Accords and Camrys and therefore will seek to pay significantly less than those cost, in order to offset this difference.  The black clouds have rolled in to cast their pall over this discussion. Let\\'s move on to more inclusive and less combative conversation, please.  Jeffy,Since you believe Edmunds TMV to be accurate, have you checked the Edmunds TCO or \"True Cost to Own\" figures? They are based off of TMV and include depreciation, financing, insurance, expected maintenance and repairs, etc.Comparing similiar models, Accord LX has the lower TCO at $0.44 per mile versus the Mazda6i SVE at $0.47 per mile.Now, that is a difference of $0.03 per mile, which at 15k miles per year is $450.It is up to the individual consumer to decide if that is significant to them or not.A Malibu LT 4 cyl has a TCO of $0.49 per mile, or $750 /year.  Are there any Aura owners on this forum? Does anyone have any experiences to share about this Saturn? Just curious.  TCO = DOA  I think the TCO is a useful starting point and guide to what to look at on the financial side, but one should adjust for their own circumstances. For example they show a much bigger difference in insurance costs than I would expect, since I pay less than $450 per year total. I would also adjust for myself based on driving about 1/2 of the miles that edmunds uses.But yes it could very well be that the Accord is cheaper overall, after considering all things. It does get a little better gas mileage for one thing. I\\'ve said before that the differences in net costs, considering initial purchase price and resale value, seem to be pretty small and should not likely be a significant factor for most. IOW, I don\\'t think there is any reason to fear that the resale value is going to kill you if you do not buy an Accord or Camry...you will likely save enough up front to offset anywhere from a little more to a little less than the resale value difference. (In the case of the Mazda6 I lean toward believng you will save a little more  )I would feel the same way about a few cents per mile difference in operating costs. That it is not a significant enough difference to concern me. If someone else is concerned about this I would suggest adjusting the edmunds figures to fit their actual circumstances and see what the difference is then.BTW, I think the Accord SE is more comparable to the Mazda6 SVE...doesn\\'t matter in this case as the cost per mile is the same as the LX.  This brings up an interesting observation I\\'ve made over the past few months - - For every person such as ourselves who know that MSRP isn\\'t what you should be paying (99% of the time), there are many others that will walk away paying MSRP on a car, or more, not even having a clue that they could have paid thousands less. I know this isn\\'t ground-breaking news, but it really amazes me how few people know that so much money can be saved by even the smallest amount of bargaining. It can even be the difference between a stepping up to a nicer class of cars depending on the situation.  many others that will walk away paying MSRP on a car, or more, not even having a clue that they could have paid thousands lesstrue or not, a very very difficult thing to fathom on a purchase of this magnitude. Maybe I am assumming too much intelligence for the average American carbuyer?  Absolutely, one should adjust for their own circumstances.In my case, because of my local dealers (only one Honda dealer and one Mazda dealer in town), the Accord ended up being the cheaper car to purchase. Of course, experiences will vary, as in other cities the Honda dealer might be snobby and the Mazda dealer might be easy to deal with, or there may be more than one dealer per make. We have two Ford and two Chevy dealers in town, but I wasn\\'t as interested.I am less than impressed with our local Mazda dealer. There\\'s another one about 30 miles away, but I\\'d rather buy local, and the Accord proved to be a worthy alternative, to me.  Resale value is highly dependent on what kind of shape the car is in. When I was about to sell my 12 year old Accord I decided to go on Kbb.com and print out a for sale sign with the equipment list and all the details on the car. When I punched in the information, and got the suggested price, I started making my own simple sign that said \"For Sale\". IMO, KBB does not allow enough variation for the condition of the car. The difference in price between \"MINT\" condition, and TOTALLY CRAPPED OUT was not big enough. They seem to care more about mileage, than they do about the actual condition of the car. I easily got $1200 more than KBB said it was worth.  with 100,000 miles should be priced similarly to a lesser (comparably equipped and sized) vehicle with 50,000 miles. Logic being Honda\\'s last over 200K while other cars are just happy to go 100K.I think that is the main driving factor behind resale value. Miles mean little to Honda/Toyota midsize cars.  Residual value is based on MSRP for the initial price and predicted market price on the back end.What was the MSRP on the Mazda6 that you paid $16,200 for?  true or not, a very very difficult thing to fathom on a purchase of this magnitude. Maybe I am assumming too much intelligence for the average American carbuyer?  I don\\'t think it\\'s a matter of intelligence, or lack there of. For Most people, buying a car is big deal, almost a special occasion. Unlike the car nuts here, I don\\'t think its something the average person does more than once every 5-10 years. So, they go into the dealership with their mind already made up as to what they want, with the intention of driving it off the lot. Then the salesman steps in and starts throwing numbers and documents at them faster than they can possibly understand them. They totally loose track of what their paying for, and how much its costing them. then, they\\'re off to the finance officer. He (in the same quick, incomprehensible fassion) starts throwing more numbers and papers arround, gives the buyer a monthly payment amount that they know the buyer will find too high. they then play with the loan term, or interest rate (maintaing the same prive for the vehicle and options) and come up with a $50 lower monthly payment. the owner quickly signs the papers thinking he just got a great deal, and doesn\\'t realize he was realy screwed till a week or so later after spending 2 hours or so reading the 30 pages of documents he brought home with him.  I\\'ll add to that... when I was in car sales for four months, there were people who just didn\\'t care about the total numbers. They just wanted to know what the payments were going to be- \"payment buyers.\" Then, there were the \"Get me done(s)\", who would just come in and say, \"Can you get me done?\" [financed]. Sometimes we\\'d have to switch vehicles on them, to something completely different, and it was no big deal to them. They just wanted something new (to them) to drive, without having to pay anything for it right at the moment. I can go on but this is getting off topic... Basically, people would surprise you.  geez, all this talk about residual values and TCO and KBB and BS and PDQ... look, all I\\'m saying is that on some cars (particularly the slower selling ones) can be had for deals that will reduce the usual impact of resale values that are often touted as benefits of buying a camcord. I\\'m not saying that everyone will be able to get the same type of deal that I did (a bit more than 6.5k off of MSRP) but if there are buyers out there that read this forum, this type of info may help them take advantage of the current market and get an amazing deal. And it is these amazing deals that can reduce the true cost to own of a Mazda6 to be among the best in this class. But that assumes that they would want a Mazda6 in the first place... but for those who want a fun to drive car that has an expressive personality and is priced very competitively, it may be worth considering.  When you buy a used vehicle, you never know what someone really paid for the car. The price is the price. The car is a value based object, if it is worth the price, with the miles, in the condition it is in, with the options it came with, if the dealer gave the car away for $1 it will not effect the resale price. The individual buyer might try to second guess the seller, but in the end the price is the price. Haggling is always a good strategy for the buyer. Buy low and sell high is a good strategy for the seller.   I\\'m not saying that everyone will be able to get the same type of deal that I did (a bit more than 6.5k off of MSRP) but if there are buyers out there that read this forum, this type of info may help them take advantage of the current market and get an amazing deal. Can \"average Joe\" of the street get 6.5k off MSRP on a Mazda6?  I don\\'t remember the numbers right now, anyone can check them, but the price shown on TCO and TMV were different. Other variable costs in TCO were auite questionable also.  An Accord or Camry with 100,000 miles should be priced similarly to a lesser (comparably equipped and sized) vehicle with 50,000 miles. Logic being Honda\\'s last over 200K while other cars are just happy to go 100K. I think that is the main driving factor behind resale value. Miles mean little to Honda/Toyota midsize cars.Andres! Where do you come up with these blanket statements? I\\'ve owned a Cam and a Cord and have an Odyssey and a TL in my garage tonight, so I obviously love Honda, but I don\\'t subscribe to the thought process that Hondas are twice as good as the others out there. I think most people buy Hondas because of their sporty, athletic attributes and their outstanding engineering, not because they feel they\\'re gonna get rewarded with out of this world qualities.  I\\'m not anybody special... I don\\'t know the dealer, salesman, or work for a company that offers special deals for buying mazda\\'s. So, yeah, I geuss any average Joe could get a similar deal as I did. In fact I\\'ve seen advertisements in our local newspaper that were offering to sell mazda6\\'s for less than I bought mine. But what buyers actually get talked into paying vs what dealers advertise is completely different. I think since many buyers are intimidated by the whole car buying process/ experience, many people act irrationally or impatiently and end up paying more than they need to. I knew what the situation was in terms of ad prices and the amount of inventory the dealers had so I leveraged this information to secure my pricing making clear to the dealers I negotiated with that I was in no particular hurry nor was I dead set in getting their car or even their brand. This midsize segment has many good cars and the vast majority of them have proven to be very reliable according to CR and JD Powers so having an open mind allowed me to be comfortable with choices that would let me maximize value and bang for my buck(s). It\\'s a buyers market for most of these cars right now, and people shopping in this category can benefit if they were to consider the many good choices in this segment.  Boy, it\\'s pretty bad when one Honda guy is telling another to tone down his love for the big \"H\"! :P We should all admire andres\\' passion for his car. But that\\'s not to say we should all follow in his and scape2\\'s footsteps. :P  where is scape2 anyways? haven\\'t seen him in a while...i love nissans, however i know they have flaws, as do all vehicles out there. the best way to decide what the best car for you is, is to go out and actually drive them. cars have come a long way, and a lot of the stereotypes are no longer even remotely valid.i have a saab 9-3 sportcombi as a loaner car while my hubby\\'s saab 9-2x is in the shop. i was very impressed! fast, fun, nimble, comfortable...i never would have thought it. im glad i don\\'t let the stereotypes get in the way...-thene   Points well taken, also part of it is that far too many buyers make these decisions based on payment size - something along the lines of walking into a dealer, with that car on their mind, as you say - and after some sticker shock will skip any preliminaries and directly ask the salesman (or this may be his first question) something like \\'what can I get for $500.00/month?\\'. The answer to that question is, of course, almost anything, if you have reasonable credit and let the dealer work its \\'magic\\'. A really big mistake IMO as the real price of anything is what it costs in cash. Giving the dealer the opportunity to \\'play\\' with any multitude of \\'financing\\' arrangements or (even worse) lease plans is nothing more than asking to get screwed. If I run into a salesman at a dealer that does ask me how much I want to pay a month initially, I will simply walk out! Thereafter the buyer\\'s remorse you mention, simply because that buyer has no idea what he really paid for his car, only that he got his 500 buck payment, and a few years later is hit with some sort of refinance (or lease \\'buyout\\') balloon or is paying some outrageous interest rate over a too long term on too high a price etc. etc. Again a hard concept for someone like me to understand - negotiate a cash deal (no trades or \\'special\\' financing), that being the true cost of the car, and then go from there if you must.  I\\'ve heard that from other people as well about the Saab 9-3. I\\'d like to see how they are to drive since most people seem to say it is a performance oriented sedan. So, I wonder how much they sell for? I remember either summer of last year or the year before when GM was having their fire sale, the Saab\\'s were being discounted heavily and I almost got the 9-2x aero (the turbo one) but by the time I got serious, they were sold out in my area. What do you think of the suspension and tranny on the 9-3? regardless, thanks for the insight...  I don\\'t remember the numbers right now, anyone can check them, but the price shown on TCO and TMV were different. Other variable costs in TCO were auite questionable also.The TCO purcahase price includes taxes and fees and \"typical\" options. But besides that, there is a difference in the TMV used in the TCO and the TMV you get when you go through the edmunds pricing function. For example the Accord SE TMV is about $600 lower in the TCO, while the Mazda6 SVE is about $100 higher in the TCO.  that assumes that they would want a Mazda6 in the first place... but for those who want a fun to drive car that has an expressive personality and is priced very competitively, it may be worth considering.Yeah, I did not buy one because it was cheaper, that was just gravy  . Just out of my own curiosity I did my own TCO, assuming I paid invoice price minus rebate (not even considering the much greater discount that I actually got). I used edmunds numbers for repair and maintenance costs. I adjusted fuel costs to reflect the amount I drive. I used edmunds figures for expected value after 5 years. I assumed no significant difference in insurance cost, because I know in my case there would not be a significant difference. As I am a cash buyer, I estimated what I would earn (after tax) on the amount saved by purchasing a 6. For me this adjusted TCO came up with the Mazda6 being cheaper than the Accord by about 3 cents per mile. This shows how much things can vary when you look at your own individual circumstances, since the generic figues had the Accord at 3 cents per mile less than the Mazda6.Now, since 3 cents per mile one way or the other amounts to about $20 per month for me, this would not be enough of a difference to push me one way or the other anyway.  Okay okay, so Honda doesn\\'t have the market cornered with excellent vehicles. But when you compare an Accord to some of the worst stuff a company like say (Chrysler) is making, then it is very easy to start saying the Honda is twice as good and doubly superior.  Would you become passionate about Honda if I offered to pay for all of your \"unexpected maintenance/repair\" costs on any Honda you purchase for the first 100,000 miles for 50% of what the Honda dealer will do it for? (the Honda care extended warranty program; usually around 1.4K after negotiating)?I\\'m giving you half off!!!  Would you become passionate about Honda if I offered to pay for all of your \"unexpected maintenance/repair\" costs on any Honda you purchase for the first 100,000 miles for 50% of what the Honda dealer will do it for? (the Honda care extended warranty program; usually around 1.4K after negotiating)?Considering that my wife\\'s Neon is over 107K miles, and I haven\\'t even come close to sinking $1400 in it for repairs, then I would\\'ve been at least $1K for NO reason. So no, I wouldn\\'t become passionate. In fact, I\\'d think they\\'re scam artists (since most \"extended\" warranties turn out to be a scam anyway).  I hear ya. There hasn\\'t been $1,400 spent on my old Accord either, and it got 174k miles. Lots of people from all makes likely have stories like ours.Have I spent money on some repairs? Sure, but at 100k miles, the only repairs were done under an extended emissions warranty (due to a recall in 1996 Accords). It needed a new Oxygen sensor.  Trust me, I wasn\\'t planning on making a penny less than $700 profit off of my \"offer.\"Heck, I\\'ll offer 60% off!:P   Those TCO figures can be so far from reality. For our \\'07 Sonata SE purchased in February: TCO says purchase price (before DMV fees, etc) is $20,855, we paid $16651. TCO says 1st year financing (with 10%) down = $1343, our 13.7% down shows our HMFC financing at $851 (the extra $700 down is NOT saving us $500 interest in the first year). The insurance, with 300K liability & UM, 5,000 medical, and $200 deductible comprehensive & $500 collision deductible is $400 less than TCO projects. TCO says the expected resale of this car after one year will be $15,195. If this is accurate, the 1st year deprecication would be $1,456, not the $6272 shown in TCO.Take the TCO with a grain of salt. As jeffyscott said, your actual purchase price will greatly affect your TCO.  Whoa - my friend. Our last 6 Chryslers lasted longer than our last 3 Hondas did. My old boss used to brag about the reliability of his high mileage Accord (Had about 200K on it) until it caught fire and burned on the interstate one morning. Guess it was equipped with the Viking funeral option package.Regards;OldCEM  Would you become passionate about Honda if I offered to pay for all of your \"unexpected maintenance/repair\" costs on any Honda you purchase for the first 100,000 miles for 50% of what the Honda dealer will do it for? (the Honda care extended warranty program; usually around 1.4K after negotiating)? How about you just reimburse me for the repairs to our \\'96 Civic and we\\'ll call it even? :shades: That would be somewhere in the range of $500-$700 that you owe me. Probalby closer to $500. We sold it with just over 40k miles on the odo and I can find the second owner if you want to reimburse him for his repair costs too. Seriously though, my answer is no. I tried to like Honda\\'s vehicles but just can\\'t. I found that I just can\\'t become passionate about a vehicle that has no passion to me. I\\'m very passionate about my Mustang but it is an American icon so not many people wouldn\\'t be. I was passionate about my Mazda6 too because it was, simply put, an amazing car. Our Explorer? Well, I\\'m not so passionate about it because it is very much like a Honda in that it is an appliance which is how I see them. Also, that Civic was the highest mileage vehicle we\\'ve ever owned. We usually lease or trade up after 2 or 3 years. Yeah, it\\'s stupid financially but I like cars a lot and it\\'s my money. :P So you\\'d never sell me on that reimbursement plan anyway.  I was bored and decided to play with the EPA\\'s new mileage estimates. I compared a 2008 FWD Taurus with a 2007 Accord V6 ATX and a 2007 Camry V6 ATX. Engines are 3.5L V6, 3.0L V6, and 3.5L V6 respectively. Trannies are 6sp, 5sp, and 6sp respectively. The Taurus and Camry have nearly equal HP while the Accord is short about 20 horses. EPA estimates for the three are 18/28, 18/26, and 19/28 respectively. The Taurus is the heaviest and the Accord is the lightest IIRC. For reference I threw in an Acura TL 3.5L V6 5sp ATX to see how the Honda 3.5L favored because it is supposedly similar to the new V6 for the Accord as we\\'ve talked about. It has roughly 20 more horses than the Taurus and Camry in terms of power and its weight falls somewhere in between the two. EPA estimates are 17/26. So I\\'m guessing we\\'re not to expect great things fromt he Accord V6 when it comes to gas mileage? Cylinder deactivation should help a little I\\'m sure. But from what I understand based on other mfrs who have implemented it, including Honda in the Odyssey, it\\'s only useful on long straight highways where you can just cruise along. I don\\'t live anywhere near those types of roads so I surely wouldn\\'t pay extra for that technology.  So I\\'m guessing we\\'re not to expect great things fromt the Accord V6 when it comes to gas mileage? a spot where we will differ, any car that logically should run in the low 6s (high 5s?) 0-60 and still return something like 30 mpg on the highway and well into the 20s all around, gets my vote for \\'great\\' gas mileage. We do after all have those 4 bangers for those willing to trade that extra performance for a mpg or two or three, don\\'t we?Chrysler (and GM) both claim a 10% increase in overall FE with the \\'variable displacement\\' systems they put on their gas hog V8s and I have observed the same thing you talk about, the inability of the cars to even hold anything close to current highway speeds on 4 cylinders. Would imagine it would be even less effective trying to get a 3400 lb. sedan to do the same given the lesser displacements (and torque) of the V6s. Think the real answers are right in front of us, OHC engines with intelligent control systems that maximize engine efficiency in almost all conditions and I wouldn\\'t bet that Honda won\\'t be able to take it to a next level above what Toyota has already done.  I wonder why the FWD Lincoln MKZ with the 3.5L V6 is rated at 17/25...1 city and 3 highway less than the Taurus :confuse: .  I can think of a few reasons. The MKZ still uses the Aisin 6 speed tranny instead of the new 6F joint venture tranny that the Taurus, Edge and MKX use. The 6F is supposed to be more fuel efficient. Not sure if the MKZ gets the 6F for 08 - I hope so. I also think they\\'ve had longer to tune the 3.5L in the Taurus for fuel economy now that Bill Ford is no longer in charge and emphasizing emissions over FE. If that\\'s the case I would expect the 08 MKZ to have improved FE.  a possibility that the \\'new\\' 3.5 is really nothing more than a bored/stroked 3.0? The car based MKX and Edge SUVs have been reviewed poorly recently by both CR and MT in comparisons, lack of engine efficiency and refinement both problems apparently. In especially the Lincoln, while noted for the good power you, would think think that Ford would\\'ve \\'tuned out\\' (or isolated) that trademark DT harshness...  Whoa - my friend. Our last 6 Chryslers lasted longer than our last 3 Hondas did.Interesting. Our experience with Chrysler would show that 6 Chryslers might have the combined lifespan of 3 Hondas! I\\'m at 174k miles on the \\'96 Accord, and it hasn\\'t stranded me yet. Has it needed some repairs? Of course. Any car with that many miles will, even so-called \"perfect\" Honda. I\\'ve spent about $1,000 in the last five years on three repairs. Not perfect, but not bad at all in my eyes.We got burned once in 1994, and in an act of stupidity, bought another one in 1996. BOTH proved to be garage-queens, with one vehicle needing a suspension rebuild, and both having transmission issues keeping them in the shop for not multiple days, but instead weeks.And, the lucky for us, the cars were so new, they never got out of their warranty (the \\'94 LeBaron Convertible had less than 20k miles and was traded 8 months after purchase on a 95 Civic. The \\'96 Sebring was sold at 35k miles because my folks knew they couldn\\'t afford the car once in ran out of warranty - they came back to Honda the second and final time). They don\\'t limit their shopping choices to Honda (nor do I), but they do boycott Chrysler, even 10 years later. And, \"Viking Funeral Package\" lol   a possibility that the \\'new\\' 3.5 is really nothing more than a bored/stroked 3.0?There\\'s a good bit more to it than that but I don\\'t know all the details off hand. Some reviews I\\'ve read of the Taurus have praised the low engine noise levels so maybe the D35 has been tweaked over the last year.  a spot where we will differ, any car that logically should run in the low 6s (high 5s?) 0-60 and still return something like 30 mpg on the highway and well into the 20s all around, gets my vote for \\'great\\' gas mileage.I don\\'t differ with you on that but I don\\'t see Honda increasing the mpg numbers over what they are for the competition that\\'s all. Claims have been made in this thread that they will increase those numbers (thus saving the planet :P ) and I\\'m a bit skeptical if you can\\'t tell.   yes, also have read some better opinions of it and not had the chance to \\'experiment\\' with one myself. But almost all reviews I\\'ve read (even the more favorable ones) still put the 3.5 at some level lower than similiar (and older) engines from you know who...  I get the impression that no matter what anyone does to their motor it will always be at least a level lower than you know who. :P One reason for the better refinement is the way Ford changed the engine mounts. They mounted it to a different part of the structure and used different mounts which went a long way. I\\'m wondering if this new discovery will carry over to other products like the Fusion in the coming years.  if Honda is going to save the planet, look for an Accord with a high tech diesel in it. Toyota\\'s 2GR is a remarkable accomplishment (and yes, I drive one of these) but I don\\'t believe even it bumps the limits of these current engines. Honda I would put a lot a faith in to improve on these things that Toyota has already proven possible, the nextstep maybe a mpg or two after correcting for EPA changes. Revolutionary hardly, although that title might be argued for the now \\'ancient\\' Nissan VQ and the Toyota 2GR.  I, too, have not had an opportunity to test drive the 3.5-liter V6 from Ford but, from what I\\'ve read on the Internet, it is a reworked 3.0-liter Duratec, but has already earned a spot as one of the 10 best engines from Wards Automotive.According to an article in Wikipedia, Ford expects the 3.5 to be in 20 percent of all FoMoCo vehicles by the end of the decade.Mileage results for this engine do not seem very impressive to me, sort of run-of-the-mill. Am I missing something here?  no actually I believe the GM 3.6 is a really fine effort, an engine that sounds and feels good in the XR (and the CTS). As for the rest of it, I don\\'t think that it can be argued, that \\'Detroit\\' mfgrs. in general has NEVER produced a smaller engine that \\'led the pack\\' in anything (except possibly gas consumption), those type of engines coming instead from the \\'Japanese\\' and \\'European\\' mfgrs.. Call it bias if you wish, I\\'ll call it fact, at least until GM/Ford/Chrysler can produce a whole lot more than just a single 3.6L \\'high-feature\\' V6.  I, too, have not had an opportunity to test drive the 3.5-liter V6 from Ford but, from what I\\'ve read on the Internet, it is a reworked 3.0-liter Duratec, but has already earned a spot as one of the 10 best engines from Wards Automotive.According to an article in Wikipedia, Ford expects the 3.5 to be in 20 percent of all FoMoCo vehicles by the end of the decade.Mileage results for this engine do not seem very impressive to me, sort of run-of-the-mill. Am I missing something here?  it is a reworked 3.0-liter Duratec, but has already earned a spot as one of the 10 best engines from Wards Automotive. I actually agree with baggs32 on this, think there just must be something more ot it than just a simple displacement increase. Ward\\'s 10 best - whoopee - that honor held for many many years by things like the 50s vintage GM pushrods (as well as the DT3.0) in whatever rendition. \\'Best\\' engines are powerful, economical, smooth and quiet, and if the DT3.5 fails to measure up in 3 of those qualities, it will never find its way under my hoods - or maybe I\\'m just expecting too much?  \\'Best\\' engines are powerful, economical, smooth and quiet, and if the DT3.5 fails to measure up in 3 of those qualities, it will never find its way under my hoods - or maybe I\\'m just expecting too much?At least you added the all-important \"if\" to your statement. I\\'m not saying Wards Automotive is the \"be-all, end-all\" judge of motors but it is a significant accomplishment to be included in the \"Ten Best,\" don\\'t you think?  So he went down in a blaze of glory; not a bad way to go in my book.   Apparently, the mid-size Fusion and Milan will continue to use the 3.0 Duratec as their V6 for the 2008 model year. The MKZ Lincoln, the Edge, the Taurus (Five Hundred) and Sable (Montego) all get the 3.5.  If you like spending \"your\" money on repairs, tow trucks, and unexpected maintenance, have at it. Your repair bill on the Civic sounds quite low. If your experience with your other cars has been similar, then you are a lucky man.I get passionate when I keep driving a Honda day after day, year after year, and I never have to lift the hood. For me, Honda\\'s number 1 attribute is bullet proof dependability. #2 is overall greatness; no weaknesses.  a significant accomplishment to be included in the \"Ten Best,\" don\\'t you think? not really, much in the same way that I don\\'t think that the Camry winning the COTY was a significant accomplishment, an award largely bestowed on that car because so many people buy them - and, incidentally why the GM 3.8/3800 pushrod/cam-in-block (or whatever marketing spin they choose to put on a really outdated design) achieved such recognition - it appeared in about every GM product known to mankind for many many years. And furthermore, I believe it to be true that \\'Ward\\'s\\' awards are also \\'sponsored\\' much in the same way as JDP\\'s - if \\'Wards\\' (in this case) knows that Ford needs some favorable pub and can get Ford to pay to use their name in some advertising campaigns, those \\'10 best\\' lists might just be predetermined!  If you like spending \"your\" money on repairs, tow trucks, and unexpected maintenance, have at it. Your repair bill on the Civic sounds quite low. If your experience with your other cars has been similar, then you are a lucky man. I get passionate when I keep driving a Honda day after day, year after year, and I never have to lift the hood. I put over $1000 in repairs into that Civic. The only other money I\\'ve ever spent on a premature or unexpected repair, and I\\'m not kidding or lying here, was $300 or so for a new A/C compressor in my \\'98 ZX2. Other vehicles I\\'ve owned, and see if you can spot the trend here now, were the \\'98 ZX2, \\'04 Mazda6 S, \\'02 and \\'05 Escape, \\'06 Explorer, and \\'06 Mustang GT.Your blanket statements of Honda\\'s perfection just don\\'t fly with me andres. I\\'m sorry to disappoint you but there are others who agree with me. Even other Honda boys and girls can\\'t believe your loyalty anymore! :P  I\\'m not Honda loyal or Honda fanatical at all. Contrary to what you\\'d like to believe.I\\'m just objective and report the truth. The truth is my family and friends have had no issues with Toyota\\'s and Honda\\'s throughout my lifetime.The truth is other cars have given Many MANY costly problems. The truth is I was the only one during my teenage years with my car in the shop all of the time (just ask all my friends). It\\'s not like I bragged about my car being a junker, but they soon caught onto the fact that Dodge sucks!  It\\'s not like I bragged about my car being a junker, but they soon caught onto the fact that Dodge sucks!What Dodge products did you have trouble with? Any mid-size variations?  It is my stern opinion that if a manufacturer can\\'t do a simple compact car correctly, then they obviously don\\'t have the qualications to do a midsize car correctly.Dodge\\'s biggest failure of all-time, the Dodge Neon. You can argue that it isn\\'t their biggest failure, but then again, Chrysler is full of failures. The Honda Accord and Civic are virtually identicle and interchangeable when it comes to build quality and long term dependability. The only difference is one is compact and one is mid-size.  Apparently, the mid-size Fusion and Milan will continue to use the 3.0 Duratec as their V6 I thimk I read in this forum, that Ford was developing a \\'new\\' 3.0 for the Fulans at about 240hp for 09/10 models. Possibly an improvement, but as is typical for Ford - too little too late, and I think it is quite obvious that they don\\'t have the money to do what they really need to in this regard.  I\\'m not Honda loyal or Honda fanatical at all.Now that\\'s funny right there, I don\\'t care who you are!  Isn\\'t it amazing how everything that gives a positive review to a Ford product is either wrong or the result of bribery? If you folks would put aside your Ford hatred long enough to look at the facts you\\'d find that Ford is doing a lot of things right nowadays and it\\'s only getting better (slowly but surely).It\\'s obvious the DT3.5L has a lot more potential in both refinement, power and fuel economy than what we saw in the 07 models as evidenced by the 08 Taurus.  I\\'m just objective and report the truth. The truth is my family and friends have had no issues with Toyota\\'s and Honda\\'s throughout my lifetime.The truth is that quality is pretty much a wash now between mfrs especially in this class of cars. What someone buys now only depends on personal preference. There is no more Honda or Toyota safety net if there ever really was one. Not long ago you could say that Honda and Toyota ruled the quality/reliability roost and back it up with different ratings and such. That time has past and it\\'s people like you that the past losers need to convince otherwise. I hope they know how hard that is going to be. :surprise:  Given that Chrysler and Dodge\\'s ad campaign is the same \"stuff\" your spewing in your forum posts, I\\'ll say they will have a tough time convincing indeed.CR doesn\\'t agree with you that the gap has closed. Until CR agrees, I don\\'t agree. Dodge claimed they weren\\'t the \"old\" Dodge back in 1994. They were the NEW Dodge in 1994. Who\\'s to say that Chrysler is now \"new\" again in 2007? How many times can you become \"new and improved?\" Reminds me of the lousy taco shop in my neighborhood. I think they\\'ve changed their name yearly in the 5 years I\\'ve been in San Diego. They have poor food quality and taste, but I went to try them again the 2nd time because they changed their name. It was terrible (and quite similar) the second time. I didn\\'t fall for the trick the 3rd and 4th time, but its a good marketing ploy.The domestics can always change names and models but the \"heart\" of the matter will never change.Like I said, one way to do it is to back it up with a warranty that has a graduated penalty assessment for warranty visits.10 year/100K mile bumper to bumper/drivetrain included warranty, with payment penalties of $50 for the second warranty vist, $100 for the third, $200 for the fourth, and so on, furthermore with rental car coverage for all of those visits.  CR doesn\\'t agree with you that the gap has closed. Until CR agrees, I don\\'t agree. CR said the Fusion is more reliable than the Camry and Accord. Do you agree?  That is ONE model for ONE year. Some consistency and long term quality please! Thank you.Also, I don\\'t know they said it was MORE reliable, just that it was very reliable it\\'s first year.I have a feeling the engineer\\'s at Ford have figured out how to make something extremely reliable for the 3 years it is under warranty, and then BOOM, the makeup washes off and you have a junker on your hands.  All I have to say is :surprise: :surprise: :surprise:  Ford was developing a \\'new\\' 3.0 for the Fulans at about 240hp for 09/10 models.That is the rumor. Supposedly it delivers a modest power boost but much better fuel mileage. The 4 cylinder will be a new 2.4L unit (again with better FE) while the performance option will be a 2.5L Twin Turbo gasoline direct injection engine producing 260 hp but delivering 30% better FE than the comparable output 3.5L duratec.The issue with the 3.5 is supply. They need all they can make right now for the Taurus/Sable/TaurusX/Edge/MKX/MKZ. That\\'s over 300K units right there. The Fulans would add another 100K to that. You can\\'t just tool up an engine factory overnight.  My ideas might seem somewhat extreme, but I for one, pledge to buy a domestic vehicle properly priced if they offer the graduated penalty payment scheme I\\'ve described.It will work, it would work, I\\'d become a customer afterall and I\\'m one of the most diehard \"I\\'ll never buy domestic again!\" pissed off customers I know!I think I might become a millionaire off of the graduated warranty payment plan by buying a domestic, so I\\'ll be first in line! :P   Also, I don\\'t know they said it was MORE reliable, just that it was very reliable it\\'s first year. They specifically said the Fusion was MORE reliable than both Camrys and the Accord V6, and just as reliable as the Accord I4.You obviously haven\\'t experienced a new Ford lately because you have no idea what you\\'re talking about and no facts to back it up.  My ideas might seem somewhat extremeMIGHT?????   That is ONE model for ONE year. Some consistency and long term quality please! Thank you. Also, I don\\'t know they said it was MORE reliable, just that it was very reliable it\\'s first year. I have a feeling the engineer\\'s at Ford have figured out how to make something extremely reliable for the 3 years it is under warranty, and then BOOM, the makeup washes off and you have a junker on your hands. C\\'mon andres, you\\'ve got to give credit where credit is due. Ford Fusion\\'s reliability rating was higher than that of Camry or Accord. That\\'s published fact. Will it continue? Who knows. Will Honda\\'s continue to be high with the \\'08 model year, or will it have issues like the 2003s (V6 tranny, Stereo Display come to mind)...? Who knows. The point is Ford came out with a brand new car and had virtually no teething problems. Honda and Toyota can\\'t say the same for their latest \"new-for 20XX\" midsize models.Do I drive a Fusion? Nope. I really disliked the interior and fuel economy vs. horsepower tradeoff. I\\'m a Honda guy. I drive two different Accords and love them both.The writing is on the wall and can\\'t be ignored (although some are proving that statement wrong), and it says that Ford has built a reliable product in the Fusion.   I really disliked the interior and fuel economy vs. horsepower tradeoff.And that is how decisions to buy one of these mid-sizers should be made now. Can people like andres3, or some that are a little less bitter if you will  , ever be convinced though is what I believe is stopping the flood gates to non Honda and Toyota dealer\\'s doors from opening.  Ford was developing a \\'new\\' 3.0 for the Fulans at about 240hp for 09/10 models. That is the rumor. Ohh, and it would have to be manufactured in Dearborn MI, that way it could be the Fulan Rouge  oh man, I\\'m killin me :blush: Get it, Fulan Rouge...  Ba dum, psssh (drum rim-shot)...That joke was so corny I could shuck it!  My ideas might seem somewhat extreme, but I for one, pledge to buy a domestic vehicle properly priced if they offer the graduated penalty payment scheme I\\'ve described. This is the difference between being a midsize sedan customer and being a Honda customer. Many users of this forum are midsize sedan customers, while a few are Honda customers.No shame in that, just changes the perspective of the discussion.  Many users of this forum are midsize sedan customers, while a few are Honda customers. What does that make me?   Many users of this forum are midsize sedan customers, while a few are Honda customers.What does that make me?Hmm there is an easy test for this. When you were looking for your last car, what vehicles did you consider (*)? If the only vehicles you considered were Japanese and had an H on the grill and trunk, then you are a Honda customer.If you considered vehicles from a number of manufacturers in the category of mid size vehicles, then you are a mid size sedan customer.(*) Making zainy demands on manufacturers of vehicles under the guise of acting like you considered them does not imply they were truly considered.  I looked at Camry (2006 model - it was Nov \\'05), Fusion, Sonata, and Altima. I was already biased to Accord though from our family liking our previous ones (all the way to 1990).I guess I\\'m normal then, huh?  If you folks would put aside your Ford hatred long enough to look at the facts the facts, at least in terms of these multiple reviews and tests by a number of folks that likely know and drive many more cars than I, are exactly what I report along with any personal impressions I get on my own (which are duly noted as such). I don\\'t \\'hate\\' Ford, at all although I firmly believe that they will never be a \\'player\\' in this particular market until they learn how to build a smaller engine.As far as: It\\'s obvious the DT3.5L has a lot more potential in both refinement, power and fuel economy than what we saw in the 07 models  Don\\'t know of many folks that are willing to pay much for \\'potential\\' when they can already have those expectations fulfilled by something else. What are you expecting folks to do, go out and spend $25-30k for \\'potential\\' or just spend it because they happen to like blue ovalled logos?  I guess I\\'m normal then, huh?Ohhh man ... must resist comment...arrggg can\\'t type what thinking... j/k   Geez, tough room. I really was kind of asking for it with a comment like that though, wasn\\'t I?  Or again, the flood gates aren\\'t opening because of many things:One of which is a one year report card does not a reliable car make! I agree, the Fusion is impressive for a domestic, very impressive in it\\'s first year. However, even my domestic lemon was actually more sweet than sour in it\\'s first year. I believe its year 3 through 4 that are most telling in a vehicle; more than any other year. The Fusion however, shows strong signs of doing well, only time will tell however. You canNOT equate one good year with decades of Accord and Camry \"legendary\" reliability.Also, the interior that isn\\'t in the same ballpark and the lower horsepower and gas mileage don\\'t help matters. Some people might be willing to take the plunge after one \"turnaround year,\" but I\\'m not one of them with Ford\\'s weak warranty; I\\'d rather get a GM! :P   Zainy demands ????I think its perfectly legitimate to make your demands, requirements, and requests known, and if the manufacturer denies them, then the manufacturer has failed to consider potentially good customers and it is not the customer who has not legitimately \"considered\" that manufacturer\\'s products. I demand Chrysler deduct the purchase price of my lemon bought in 1994 (95 model) from any future Chrysler purchase. I think this is more than reasonable and fair, since I\\'m not charging interest, tow trucks, nor repair costs; just the purchase price. If the answer is no, then there will be no future purchase for them from me. It\\'s quite simple really.Now all Ford or GM have to do is beef up the warranty and offer a payment plan when I have to use that warranty too much and too often.If they are so great now, why can\\'t they do this?  You canNOT equate one good year with decades of Accord and Camry \"legendary\" reliability. I bet the Camry owners with sludged engines thought the same thing. Same for the 07 Camry and Honda/Acura transmission problems. Face it - Camcords are no longer bulletproof.As for 4-5 yr reliability:90 Ranger - 5 years95 Ranger - 5 years00 Lincoln LS - 6 years99 Expedition - 5 yearsAll 4 Vehicles were kept 2 years beyond the factory warranty. I never spent a single dime on repairs outside of regular maintenance. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. I guess now you\\'ll say that they start falling apart in year 7. I will agree that the current Fusion interior is not as nice as the Camcords, especially the center stack but that is being addressed for the 09 model. And Fuel Economy is way behind the competition. We\\'ll see if that gets addressed for 09.   Don\\'t know of many folks that are willing to pay much for \\'potential\\' when they can already have those expectations fulfilled by something else. What are you expecting folks to do, go out and spend $25-30k for \\'potential\\' or just spend it because they happen to like blue ovalled logos?The differences you\\'re referring to are only important to a small handful of enthusiasts, most of whom wouldn\\'t buy a Fusion anyway. The Fusion isn\\'t getting the 3.5L anyway so it\\'s a moot point here.  Times change, as do fortunes. The Taurus was the best-selling car in the U.S. for nearly a decade but Ford squandered away its legacy and the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord climbed to the top of the mid-size heap where they comfortably remain.My wife and I decided on a Ford Fusion last December because of its style and handling; its creature features; its high ratings in Consumer Reports, J.D. Power and Associates and other respected publications.We also had enjoyed relatively good performance from two other Ford products, a 1997 Thunderbird with 85,000 miles on the clock and a 2000 Focus station wagon with 92,000 miles on the odometer.We also have a super Ford, Lincoln, Mercury dealer in town and got a fair -- but not sensational -- deal on a 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion.Except for poor in-city gas mileage -- a constant 14.8 mpg -- the Fusion has been perfect for seven months and 3,700 miles. The longest journey begins with a single step.Despite all that, the legions of passionate Honda owners on this forum make me wonder if we made a mistake. I don\\'t think so at this juncture but the thought has entered my mind.I would never buy a Toyota because of the oil sludge debacle, a much worse scenario than the Ford Explorer\\'s Firestone tires fiasco. Honda, on the other hand, has not been smitten by any major malfunctions and I know for certain that a 2007 Accord is going to be worth significantly more than our 2007 Fusion in three years.As good as the Fusion might be, I just don\\'t see Ford, GM, Chrysler, Subaru, Nissan or anyone else dethroning Camry and Accord. It just ain\\'t gonna happen. Camry and Honda owners are just too loyal (except for the sludge owners maybe).  As for 4-5 yr reliability: 90 Ranger - 5 years 95 Ranger - 5 years 00 Lincoln LS - 6 years 99 Expedition - 5 years I noticed you didn\\'t mention mileage; you drive 3K a year?  That puts you squarely in the 15K mile range, impressive! ahahah. please state your mileage with each please.  As good as the Fusion might be, I just don\\'t see Ford, GM, Chrysler, Subaru, Nissan or anyone else dethroning Camry and Accord. It just ain\\'t gonna happen.I think the biggest threat to Honda and Toyota is likely themselves. I think many people would back me up on that. Honda and Toyota owners are loyal, and until those companies do something to betray that trust, many will stay loyal to that.  Um, let\\'s don\\'t go any deeper into SUVs here, okay?  Ford clearly abandoned its Taurus base by not improving the car. Honda and Toyota seem to be smarter than that. Still, Toyota stonewalled on the sludge issue and it finally took a class-action lawsuit to solve the problem. I, for one, would never buy a Toyota because of that issue.  :P who\\'s experience was good enough that not only would I get another Honda, but I\\'d recommend them instantly.However, due to the small amount of issues with my \\'03 Accord, I was unhappy with some of the service dept. employees and having to deal with them with my US built Accord. I was dissatisfied at having to visit the dealer more than zero times, let alone the half dozen or so times I had to go; mainly due to window moldings that they never had parts for, and then the big one being the tranny recall fix then failure soon thereafter.Honda dealt with me superbly and honored the vehicle by paying for everything, even after warranty. They even paid for the rental car with the embarrassing tranny debacle. Even with all that.... I currently most recently purchased a 2006 Audi A3 DSG Sport 2.0!  FANTASTIC CAR! Did I switch brands because Honda\\'s lack of bulletproof (US Built cars) turned me off? Or did I simply switch because Honda refuses to currently make a hatchback/sportback type car thats bigger than a Mini?Probably a little of both, and the fact I wanted something new and the redesign wasn\\'t ready yet. Now some say that Audi is the German Subaru, or is it Subaru is the Japanese Audi :P .Next time I go car shopping I\\'ll include many considerations; especially Subaru with their stellar reliability; although in 20K miles the A3 has been mechanically and electrically flawless.When I chose the A3 I considered the Altima, A4, Camry, RAV4, 3 Series, Mazda 3, Mazda 6, Accord, Civic SI, GTI, GLI, TSX, TL (sort of; a bit out of my price range). I actually test drove the RAV4, Mazda3. I looked in and touched and studied in person the 3 Series, GTI, TSX, and TL. (Test drove 3 year old 325 BMW too if that counts; not impressed with the 2.5 gutless inline 6).  How many people were involved/affected by sludge with Toyotas?  Exactly, no reason to betray the trust until you yourself, are betrayed.Why fix what ain\\'t broke!!??I\\'d rather put my money where I know I\\'ll consistently win and I\\'m going to win for sure, then gamble big-time and lose more then once and look like a fool twice! :sick:  It was an extensive problem that involved many, many thousands of cars.  Please stick to MIDSIZE SEDANS here.  are being and will continue to be removed.Please compare the features and attributes of the actual vehicles in this class and please stop trying to beat others over the head with your own personal preferences/choices in this category.Many of you seem to forget that the bottom line purpose of this discussion is to help those who are trying to make a purchase decision in this class.

Take your favorite car in this segment and tell us one thing you think has been done very well and then tell us one thing where you think an improvement is needed. Honda AccordPros-Excellent power/fuel economy ratio (especially 4-cyl)-Sporty but not jarring handling-Uptown interior appointmentsCons-Exterior styling (2003-2005 was worse than 06-07, but its still no beauty queen today)-Road noise-You can\\'t drive two blocks without seeing oneSorry, I couldn\\'t stop at just one.And yes, I have Accords, and love them.  Kia OptimaFavorite thing: Honyota-like quality for a bargain price.Needs improvement: Offer ABS and ESC as standard equipment, or at least as easily-available, low-cost options.  I drive a Mazda6Pros..HandlingStyleTidier dimensions (for me, anyway)BrakingInterior comfort.Nifty split folding seats.Cons... Low power/MPG ratio turning radius some weird HVAC/radio control Is Mazda the LAST manufacturer to not illuminate the door switches?  Favorite thing:Thoroughly modern, comfortable midsize sedan with appealing, distinctive styling.Needs improvement:AWD V6 gets atrocious in-city mileage, a constant 14.8 mpg.  With reading that you had to take your bullet proof Honda back to the dealer a half dozen or so times within 3 model years, I can\\'t understand the blinders you are wearing. Heck, you even bought a different make car. (My \\'05 Sonata, btw, has had to go to the dealer exactly ZERO times. I have taken it to the dealer for oil changes but no repair of anything has needed to be addressed by anyone.) Did you know that the 3 Series you considered does not have an oil dipstick? You cannot check your oil...you have to rely upon an idiot light.  Hey another mazda6 driver! Welcome, it\\'s always good to have another person w/ great taste on this board! pros of the Mazda6- it\\'s dual nature: can be quiet and composed but can also become extroverted and engaging when you want. the 6 can be extremely practical (especially in the hatch and wagon versions) while also being very indulgent. - thoughtful and unique engineering: things like having the volume of the stereo adjust itself automatically as the car goes faster or slower and the levers in the trunk that with a simple pull, the 60/40 seats spring forward when you need to transport some bigger items. cons:lots of brakedust requires frequent cleaning of the wheels to keep them looking decent armrests on the doors are too hardturning radius is a bit largeno mp3/ auxilary input (easily fixed by aftermarket though)gauges and center console display needs a redesign - they don\\'t look bad, but for a car with lots of charisma everwhere else, this area needs some attention.  03 Accord EX V6Likes: Solid, and stable at any speed. Power to spare. Rides, and handles very well. Dislikes: Could use more rear seat space. Stock tires are not very good for anything but high mileage.  Glad you enjoyed my humor. My experience with Honda. First one ( a 79 Accord) when about 112K, and, engine blew. Second one, bought for son, was an 83 Accord with a little over 100K on it. The 5 speed manual destroyed itself shortly after we purchased it, and, had to be replaced. The car made it to about 160K, and, the oil pump drive failed, frying the engine. The next, for other son, was a early 90\\'s civic, bought used. It made it to about 109K, when the engine\\'s valvetrain destroyed itself. Engine was replaced, and, the car made it to about 150K and was sold. I bought a new 91 Accord that, under warranty, lost its AC, both healight assemblies, had brake problems, and absolutely couldn\\'t be aligned so it wouldn\\'t eat tires in less than a few thousand miles. Car was traded in at 20K miles. Last Honda was a late 90\\'s used Civic, bought for Daughter to take to college and work. Had about 40K on it when we bought it. During the 2 years she drove it, the window mechanisms failed, one side mirror fell off, the exhaust manifold/convertor assembly broke ($1000 fix), and the engine developed a huge thirst for oil. At 86K, it needed an engine overhaul, and, I sold it. Do I think Chryslers are that great - not hardly. I buy them for business use because they\\'re cheap, and, I dump them around 95K miles. Regards:OldCEM  Don\\'t know about glory. The last year he owned it, he\\'d spemt a bunch of cash at the dealer keeping it running. He\\'s still in the fold though. Last time I saw him, he\\'s driving a new Honda Accord.Regards:OldCEM  If you\\'ve had such bad experiences with Hondas, why did you keep buying them. :confuse: My first Accord was great, that\\'s why I bought another one. The new one (4 years old) seems to have been cut from the same cloth, so I don\\'t see myself changing brands with the next one either.  Chrysler Sebring:Pros:Comfortable on tripsDecent TrunkDecent power with 2.7V6Great fuel economyCheap to buy even considering horrid depreciation.Makes driving its stablemate even more enjoyable(Its European).I\\'m on a first name basis with the dealer\\'s service manager and the zone rep.Current Sebring has convinced me not to buy another one. Probably go with Fusion or Mazda 6 next go around.Cons:Transmission sounds like an electric can-opener at low speeds.Plan on numerous trips to dealer in first 30K miles to get gremlins out.Depreciates like a brick falling from sky. Must time purchase decision with max rebates and 0% financing.Regards:OldCEM  Take your favorite car in this segment and tell us one thing you think has been done very well: I think the Mazda6 is the best looking of these moderately priced midsize cars. I list that not because stying is the most important factor, but it is one where, imo, this car really stands out.and then tell us one thing where you think an improvement is needed: It should have extendable sun visors to block the sun when it is coming in the side window. The lack of this feature is a minor irritation, what would it have cost to include them an extra $10???  I think the Mazda6 is the best looking of these moderately priced midsize cars. I list that not because stying is the most important factor, but it is one where, imo, this car really stands out.My wife and I felt exactly the same way about the Fusion.  2005 Nissan Altima 2.5SPros:-Love the styling of my 05 (looks better than 02-04s & 07)-V6 like power in a four cylinder engine-All that room insideCons:-Some cheap materials (But WAY better than 02-04 models)-Gruff, unrefined sounding I4 when pushed hard.-MPG not great  Trim Levels are as follows:LX: Top safety and convenience features offered with outstanding LX value and quality LX standard features include: Power windows, doorlocks and door mirrors 6 speaker AM/FM/CD audio now with steering wheel mounted audio controls Cruise Control Front, side and side curtain airbags LX-P: Adds premium comfort and styling features to LX value LX-P features added to LX include: Alloy wheels 8-way power diver&#146;s seat Security System ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EX: Upgraded from the LX trims with sporty and premium features EX features added to LX-P include: Power Moonroof In-dash 6CD changer Premium interior trim Premium cloth seats Upgraded alloy wheels Heated mirrors ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EX-L: The most premium version of the EX trim EX-L features added to EX include: Leather seating surfaces and steering wheel Premium audio system with XM Heated seats Dual zone climate control system Available navigation system with Bluetooth ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Accord 6-Cylinder Sedan EX: Upscale and sophisticated V6 sedan EX V6 features include: Power Moonroof Power windows, doorlocks and door mirrors 6 speaker AM/FM/6CD audio with steering wheel mounted audio controls Cruise Control Front, side and side curtain airbags Upgraded alloy wheels Premium cloth seats 8-way power diver&#146;s seat Security System Premium interior trim Heated mirrors Dual exhaust finishers ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EX-L V6: The most luxurious Accord EX-L V6 features added to EX V6 include: Leather seating surfaces and steering wheel Premium audio system with XM 4-way Power passenger&#146;s seat Heated seats Dual zone climate control system Homelink system Available navigation system with Bluetooth ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Accord 4-Cylinder Coupe LX-S: Sporty features offered with outstanding LX value and quality LX-S standard features include: Power windows, doorlocks and door mirrors Alloy wheels 6 speaker AM/FM/6CD audio with steering wheel mounted audio controls Cruise Control Security System Front, side and side curtain airbags ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EX: Upgraded from the LX-S trims with sporty and premium features EX features added to LX-S include: Power Moonroof Premium audio system Premium interior trim Premium cloth seats Heated mirrors ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EX-L: The most premium version of the EX trim EX-L features added to EX include: Leather seating surfaces and steering wheel XM 8-way power diver&#146;s seat Heated seats Dual zone climate control system Available navigation system with Bluetooth ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Accord 6-Cylinder Coupe EX-L V6: Powerful and upscale sports coupe EX-L V6 features include: Leather seating surfaces and steering wheel Power Moonroof Dual zone climate control system Premium audio system with XM Upgraded alloy wheels 8-way power diver&#146;s seat Power windows, doorlocks and door mirrors Cruise Control Front, side and side curtain airbags Security System Premium interior trim Heated seats and mirrors Homelink system Dual exhaust finishers Available navigation system with Bluetooth  ...the Accord\\'s \"value\" trim level seems to be the LX-P this time around if you don\\'t seek a sunroof. It appears that the very first spy shots of the Accord sedan were indeed a Silver LX-P as many speculated here and on Vtec.netI\\'m disappointed in a lack of features though seeing as the Accord is Honda\\'s flagship sedan. The Camry and even the Altima have some features that this \"flagship\" is missing yet the CamTima aren\\'t flagships.For example, I would have liked bluetooth at least standard on EX-L models but it appears you have to get the Navigation system to get it. Push button start would have been neat as well, to some it\\'s a gimmick but i really like it. I drive a truck now (lol..from college student to car salesman to truck driver) and my truck as push button start...it\\'s kinda neat. What about a rearview Camera with Nav. system? Steering wheel climate controls (Camry and Fusion have those on top level trims) reclining rear seats?Power adjustable pedals? Rear audio controls?It appears that equipment levels really aren\\'t changing and that the LX-P is really nothing more than an SE with a power driver\\'s seat. Wouldn\\'t Honda\\'s whole claim of being the \"most luxurious\" sedan in the class be false, seeing as both the Camry and Altima at current levels seem to offer more than the Accord will? The list is just preliminary, but I would think if some stand out features were coming they\\'d be mentioned. For example, rain-sensing wipers..they don\\'t appear to be there.  A few thoughts - looks pretty much like what people would expect, based on previous Accord generations.A few notes/questions:1) No LX V6? That\\'s a bummer; I think there\\'s definitely room in this lineup for, for example, an LX-P V6 to slot in below the EX V6.2) Why can\\'t we have dual zone auto climate control without having to take leather? I frekin hate leather, especially if the cloth interior is done well. Along the same lines, I wish NAV was available on non leather models as well.3) Keyless start and music hard-drive, anyone? Gosh, even the new Lancer and Sentra have these (not to mention the Versa!!)  ...thank insiders on Vtec.net. I\\'m just a fast messenger.I agree an LX-PV6 should be available seeing as the ole \"SEV6\" was a HOT seller for Honda, or so it seemed, yet they couldn\\'t move an LXV6 before 2006 when it had the same features as the SE sans the alloy wheels. I also agree on some of your other points. Honda is far far to conservative with features it seems. What about some Xenon headlights for the EXLV6? And maybe more color combinations? White can\\'t be had with Gray or black interiors...  I wonder what the \"SE\" models will be like at the end of this new generation\\'s cycle in about 5 years?But even if it lacks some features...I still find it as attractive as the current Altima. And that\\'s a LOT coming from someone who didn\\'t care for the current generation. I still say the Camry will have a slight lead in the features department if this preliminary list is all the Accord will get.  I never knew Accords came in so many flavors. It\\'s a bit mind boggling.  Accord Sedan 08/07 NA/VP LX/LX LX-P/SE EX/EXEXL/EXL NA/SEV6EXV6/LXV6EXLV6/EXLV6So there are actually fewer trim levels for 08 verses 07.Six verses eight. Actually it\\'s really only four when you group certain trims together. The EX/EXV6 are the same except engine and the EXL/EXLv6 are the same as well.They are really no different then say A Fusion SEL and a Fusion SEL with leather and other options or a Camry XLE and a Camry XLE with leather. Instead of the typical option choices of the Camry, Altima and Fusion, Honda simply has different trim levels. Seems a bit much when first looking at them, but those trim levels are easier to deal with then say 3 trims with multiple avaiable options (especially true for the Altima, Camry and Fusion)Fusion: Has FiveSSE/SEV6SEL/SELV6 But the options make things hecticCamry: Has 8!!!!CELE/LEV6SE/SEV6XLE/XLEV6HybridThings get real crazy with the Camry...especially if you won\\'t certain options that appear on paper but are far from reality.Altima: Has six2.52.5S2.5S with SL pkg.3.5SE3.5SLHybridFrom experience. Nissan is the worst. Either basic transportation or fully loaded Infiniti-like prices. Choose your poision. I only wonder if Honda will undercut the Camry in price. The Camry LE is cheaper MSRP/Invoice wise than even the current Accord... :surprise:  In my opinion, that is one of the reasons why Accords have high resale value. It is easy to price a certain trim level as there are no options. It is OK to have options bundles like the Altima does, they don\\'t add too much confusion. However, when your options list is a mile long, the used vehicle becomes harder to value, and the price of many of those options when the vehicle was purchased new may not get reflected in the book value.  EX-L V6: The most luxurious Accord EX-L V6 features added to EX V6 include: Leather seating surfaces and steering wheel Premium audio system with XM 4-way Power passenger&#146;s seat Heated seats Dual zone climate control system Homelink system Available navigation system with Bluetooth This can\\'t be the whole story. The only thing on this list that was not available on the 03 EX V6 is Bluetooth. That can\\'t be the only thing new here, can it? No mention of ESC? This list should be much much longer.I want adjustable pedals, for one thing. They could wait until the next generation to add them for me though. I won\\'t be buying a new Accord for another 5 years at least.  I agree, I think the Mazda6 is a great-looking car even though the design is five years old. It would be my top choice in this field were it not for questions about safety (no IIHS side impact tests run with the side airbags) and mediocre fuel economy. It\\'s also one of the few cars in this class available as a hatchback and/or wagon--and the only one available as both.  Max - the Camry option list is much shorter than in former generations. In fact, the only model with a moderately long option list is the SE.For the others, here are the major factory options available:CE - VSCLE - JBL/Bluetooth, Alloys, VSC, MoonroofXLE - VSC, Intelligent Key (V6), Heated Seats, NAV, Leather (4 cyl.)Hybrid - NAV, Moonroof, Leather, Heated SeatsToyota has a ton of port-installed accessories, but that\\'s pretty much the factory list.Not sure how thats \"real crazy\"?  It\\'s crazy in that in the SE, a lot of \"options\" that are available in the brochure will never be found on the lots. Maybe I should have been more specific seeing as it\\'s my region and the distribution center and not just Toyota as a Company. Yet even with the options that are available on the Camry, it\\'s not as easy to find say a Camry LE with Alloys, Sunroof and JBL verses say an Accord EX.It gets that much more complicated with the SE model where certain packages are only available with the automatic transmission and even then in certain regions Toyota (the Company) doesn\\'t allow certain model configurations. That\\'s CRAZY in that the brochure says you can get them, but in reality you can\\'t. Example try finding say a Camry XLEI4 with just the VSC option without leather.So while the list may be shorter, many of the options aren\\'t available to every and those that are get combined most of the time and aren\\'t really a la carte.Honda makes is simpler by just making trim levels optionless.CE for example is pretty easy to equipt.LE models get a bit more difficult in the SE region..and XLE models come either no option XLE or loaded  I thought the 79 Accord was OK - that\\'s why I bought the new one in 91. The others belonged to my kids. They insisted that the Hondas were what they wanted, and, I did my best to keep them running. The new ones now, I\\'m sure, are fine. However, I\\'ll never buy another used one that I\\'m not familiar with how it was cared for. The last one, the Civic I bought my daughter, was purchased off a big Ford dealer\\'s lot. It was clean, and, I got a good deal on it. However, I\\'ll willing to bet the first owner skrimped on oil changes.Regards:OldCEM  However, I\\'ll never buy another used one that I\\'m not familiar with how it was cared for. Would that not be true of any make of car?  If you\\'re going to classify the number of trim levels like that then add 2 more to the Fusion\\'s list for SEV6 AWD and SELV6 AWD. For 2008 there is a sport trim now too.  I\\'m disappointed in a lack of features though seeing as the Accord is Honda\\'s flagship sedan.The Accord can\\'t push into the TL\\'s back yard too much considering they share a platform.  sure It can. just improve the TL even more when its redesigned. Kind of like what Nissan is doing with the altima, maxima and G. the G has been redesigned to stay ahead of the altima. currently, not much difference between a fully loaded altima 3.5se and a max. When the max gets its redesign in 09 or 10, It will have to be bumed up to separate itself from the altima. I\\'m betting the diesel option that will be available is part of that plan.  sure It can. just improve the TL even more when its redesigned. Kind of like what Nissan is doing with the altima, maxima and G. the G has been redesigned to stay ahead of the altima.I understand your point somewhat - but the Altima and Maxima are so much alike now, and the G35 is RWD and a totally different animal the the others, even tho they share the VQ engine.I think Honda knows what got them where they are and a loaded up Accord is just too much. Rain sensing wipers? C\\'mon. How about slippers, a pipe and a newspaper every morning?  I think though, the risk is not offering enough new toys and gadgets. a lot of people are holding off on a car purchase to see what the 08 accord is like. It could hurt honda if a lot of them just view it as the same old same old. not that anybody really knows for sure that it is. I mean, they certainly arn\\'t doing anything darring with the styling, I wouldn\\'t even say exciting. Its going to be hard to improve much on the handling and fit/finish of the previous gen, so more options would seem the logical way to go. Unless of course, they\\'re doing it on purpose to go out and undercut the camry and altima price wise.  I totally forgot about the AWD models. LOL  agreeing 100 percent.As I said earlier, if Toyota can have a Camry, Lexus ES350, Avalon and IS350 all co-exist in similar price ranges, Honda should be able to pull off the TL/TSX/Accord scenerio.The Accord is the flagship for Honda so it needs to be packin the most features, even if some of those features step on the toes of the current TL because within a year the TL will get a redesign the following year.I think it\\'s just an excuse, Honda no one is asking Honda to make memory seats standard or be equipped with some of the luxuries of the TL, but I do feel like the Accord should be packin features that the main competition from Toyota and Nissan are offering, even if that means ever so slightly stepping on the toes of the TL.  Well, I think too many gadgets raises the price unnecessarily, for thinks I don\\'t really want. XM radio, don\\'t need it. I-Pod connection, don\\'t need it. Nav., I don\\'t need that either. I am perfectly happy listening to my favorite FM radio station, and I have always made it to my destination without Navigation. They have all those signs cluttering up the highway, so I may as well use them. I do want things like Air-Bags, ABS, and ESC. I would rather not have to pay for all those gadgets, to get what\\'s really important (to me).  3) Keyless start and music hard-drive, anyone? Gosh, even the new Lancer and Sentra have these (not to mention the Versa!!)Eh this really doesn\\'t bother me. I have an iPod. I don\\'t need the same music in 16 places. I have it on CDs, my computer, and my iPod. I like that most vehicles are supporting an iPod connection either via USB or the iPod connector.It seems like this is the trend anyway, with all the after-market navigation and cell phone content provided.  thats your age showing :P  I like the leather seats, but I could also do without the \"power\". I think the non-power seats are quicker, and easier to move. I have to stand outside the car, and move the seat back before getting in. With the power seat, I have to stand there for quite a while, waiting for the seat to move. The manual seat would be quicker for me. I don\\'t think there are leather seats, that are not also power seats. That\\'s life, I guess.  XM radio, don\\'t need it.I wouldn\\'t buy another car without it. Check out the channel lineup one day and you\\'ll see at least 10 stations you can\\'t live without. National coverage. Live sports events from the PGA Tour to NASCAR and all in between. Mega news and weather for any city/region, anytime. No morning BS talk \"shows\". Etc. Etc. About $12 a month.Once you go XM, you\\'ll never go back. Kinda like cable vs. rabbit ears, only no commercials.  I have to agree with elroy5. All these gadgets rob power from getting to the wheels and create a windfall for someone to fix when they go south.Granted the advanced technology wasn\\'t there in the 50s and 60s BUT..............There is no better feeling on this planet than smoking the rear wheels on a hemi-cuda, 442, or big block GM.   But I thought Honda had the whole reliability thing on lock?So chances are the gadgets won\\'t go south.No matter how you guys feel about it, the Accord is in the most competitive class of vehicles sold in this country. It has got to pack the features of the competition b/c folks will notice.I think what we have seen is simply a short list of what will be avaialble..everything isn\\'t being shown yet...hopefully.   No morning BS talk \"shows\". Etc. Etc. That\\'s one of the things I like about my favorite FM station (Walton & Johnson in the morning), and it doesn\\'t cost a dime. Nope, no XM needed here.  Your post reminded me that the Honda press release didn\\'t say anything about the availability of ESC on the 2008 Accord I4s. I wonder if that will change for 2008, or if it will still be only on the V6s?  My wife\\'s finalists were the Optima and the Fusion/Milan. I do agree with you that the four cylinder in the Optima seemed quite a bit more sophisticated, funny because we found the same basic engine in the Sebring to be a lot rougher. The other kicker was interior quality, she got the LX with appearance group and add-on leather for $16,100. The best thing about the appearance group is the electroluminescent lighting, some of the other features are strangely crippled-- only car I\\'ve ever seen without a MPG indicator on its DIC-- hopefully they\\'ll correct that for 08. Our enthusiasm for the Optima would have applied only to the four, the six doesn\\'t give you much more in power plus you have a timing belt to fool with. With the optional 17 inch Michelins, the Optima is close in handling to the Fusion/Milan. The better NVH and nicer interior plus lower price trump any advantage in that department.  Honda does have reliability on lock, I have heard the accord referred to as \" bulletproof\". But when something does go south, it costs a fortune to fix. I had a 5 year old pickup and the plastic fan in front of the condenser broke and it cost $500 to fix it. We bought an Accord a month later. Our 2nd car is a 14 year old Integra RS, only A/C and an AM-FM radio. Except for normal maintenance, only two issues. New brakes and a Main Relay.  The I4 engines in the Sebring and Optima/Sonata really aren\\'t the same. They have some common design elements, but each manufacturer in the Hyundai/DCX/Mitsubishi alliance builds its own variant of the basic design. That could account for why the engine sounds different in the Sebring than the Optima. Or maybe the Optima\\'s engine bay is better insulated?  I thouht honda fixed everything for free?  Nope, no XM needed here.Do you even have cable TV?  Ask me eight years from now.  Your post reminded me that the Honda press release didn\\'t say anything about the availability of ESC on the 2008 Accord I4s. I wonder if that will change for 2008, or if it will still be only on the V6s? They will all have ESC by the time I buy a new car again. My 03 should not need replacing before 2012, when it will be mandated. I will probably get either the diesel or V6 again anyway.Do you even have cable TV? Yes, but just the basic channels. The NFL and NCAA FB are on cable. Go Saints, Go Tigers.  I wouldn\\'t buy another car without it. Check out the channel lineup one day and you\\'ll see at least 10 stations you can\\'t live without. National coverage. Live sports events from the PGA Tour to NASCAR and all in between. Mega news and weather for any city/region, anytime. No morning BS talk \"shows\". Etc. Etc.About $12 a month.Once you go XM, you\\'ll never go back. Kinda like cable vs. rabbit ears, only no commercials.I actually dislike XM radio. I enjoy local content, I like listening to non-ClearChannel stations where the DJs are actially from the town where the station originates. If I wanted to listen to the same 10 songs all the way across the country I can just find the appropriately categorized ClearChannel station.Supposedly the HDFM has similar sound quality to XM or Sirus and is free. It also opens up \"sideband\" on the FM dial giving listeners much more access to programming.For my needs, I would much much rather have an integrated iPod controller than XM or a hard drive system in the car.  Last week I posted a video and a description of the techniques I am using for city driving to try and test the maximum city MPG the car can obtain (07 LX manual). Now half of the tank of fuel is gone, and the results are impressive enough that I\\'m going to continue for the second half tank to get the full results.240+ miles on half a tank, mostly city... When the gauge is on \"E\" I\\'m usually around 360-400 miles and it takes 13-14 gallons to fill. I could see over 34 MPG for this tank. Not that I\\'m a fuel ecomonomy freak, that was just another limit I wanted to test (after acceleration and handling, lol).  I actually dislike XM radio. I enjoy local content XM doesn\\'t replace FM, just adds to it. FM sucks anyway. How many more times do we gotta hear Golden Earring or BTO before we slit our wrists?Supposedly the HDFM has similar sound quality to XM or Sirus and is free.You get free commercials too. You don\\'t get XM for the sound quality. Its for the content which blows away AM/FM.I would much much rather have an integrated iPod controller than XM or a hard drive system in the carYou can have both. Once you listen to a song on your IPod, how many more times do you want to hear it that hour, or day, or week etc? Again, XM, with its HUGE content, is unbeatable. You can get an XM kit for $35.Can you tell I love mine?  The differences you\\'re referring to are only important to a small handful of enthusiasts, most of whom wouldn\\'t buy a Fusion anywaySee, we finally agree on something. The only problem I have with this statement, is WHY? Why can\\'t somebody who buys a Fusion also be part of your \\'handful of enthusiasts\\'? Would suggest to you, that even the 6, hampered by similiar drivetrain limitations, caters almost specifically to the enthusiast. Almost all the cars in this group have something to \\'hang its hat on\\'. Examples: Honda a silky smooth 4 and V6, gas mileage, resale values, probable reliablility, along with a ride that is a good compromise between sporting and soft, the Camry pretty much the same except with a generally \\'softer\\' ride, the Sonata, price and a really decent V6 for cheaper than most other 4s, the Altima a legendary V6, spunky 4, high resales and the CVT, the 6, handling and price etc. At which point we come to the Fusion and I guess all we can talk about is how cheap (or subjectively pretty) they are and the gas consumption qualities of silly AWD?And yes the Fusion should remain less of a car, unless Ford can figure out a way to get some improved version of the 3.5 in it. By the time Ford gets around to its rumored 240hp 3.0, it will likely still be at least 40-50hp (and a few mpgs) short of what the big boys are doing by then.  You can have both. Once you listen to a song on your IPod, how many more times do you want to hear it that hour, or day, or week etc? Again, XM, with its HUGE content, is unbeatable. You can get an XM kit for $35.Yeah, I think I just have things I would rather do with the money. I\\'m glad you like it, but it doesn\\'t add any value for me.  I have a n 03 Accord with 50000. Under warranty honda replaced the catalytic converter (it smelled) the back brakes and the radio. I have no fault to find with them. The stupid oxygen sensor had to replaced after warranty and that was a pain in the wallet. Overall with new tires YOKOHAMA) the car is a dream to drive 29mpg on expressway Moral don\\'t buy the first year model if there are some major changes  No car is perfect. Even the top manufacturers somehow have a few lemons coming off the line.The rear brakes eh? Those should last a LONG time. Is yours a 4cyl or a 6?  Once again, I thought honda didn\\'t charge for after warranty repairs?  After 25 years of owning nothing but Accords (78, 86, 98) I bought an Aura XR last month and I love it. I tested Camry, Accord, Mazda 6, Fusion, and Aura. The Aura was head and shoulders above all the other choices. It was tough to disabuse myself of my anti-American car bias, but it wasn\\'t a tough decision once I compared all the cars. I love the power, comfort, ride, quiet interior, styling (interior and exterior) and the value. Terrific buying experience and $2250 in incentives. If you had told me that I would buy a Saturn a week before I did, I would have laughed. I set out to buy a Camry or another Accord, but forced myself to look at more than those cars and I\\'m glad I did. Camry and Accord are great cars. No brainer purchases. I found the Aura to be a better car and a better value. Time will tell if that was a good decision. If it weren\\'t for having to replace the catalytic converter at 95k miles and the transmission at 142k miles on my 98 Accord, I probably wouldn\\'t have looked at other cars.  What I meant was the number of enthusiasts who care whether the V6 has 221 hp or 260 and who would consider buying a Fusion is relatively small and wouldn\\'t make a big difference in overall sales. What the Fusion needs is a nicer interior and better fuel mileage and more features. The Camry doesn\\'t sell 400k units a year to enthusiasts.In addition to the rumored 240 hp 3.0 there is a twin turbo 2.5L putting out 260 hp but hopefully getting better fuel mileage than comparable V6s. Of course if that happens you\\'ll just find some other excuse to not like the Fusion.  Sarcasm noted (multiple times now). We get it, jd.  To a certain extent, I\\'m sure. However I think the low tech engines tolerate skimpy maintenance better. Over the years I\\'ve purchased other used vehicles that didn\\'t die prematurely, but, they were all domestics - run of the mill Fords, Chevys, and Chryslers.Regards:OldCEM  The Brilliance BS6 sounds like anything but. Well, Brilliance, no, but BS yes. Didn\\'t someone on this forum say the Chinese were going to be formidable? Looks like even Chrysler could compete with these cars.http://www.caranddriver.com/previews/13310/first-drive-2007-brilliance-bs6-driving-impressions-and-issues-page2.html  I won\\'t do it anymore, just couldn\\'t resist though. :P  what did you like most about it? Or better yet, what ways did you find it superior to other cars you shopped for. what surprissed you the most?  If it weren\\'t for having to replace the catalytic converter at 95k miles and the transmission at 142k miles on my 98 Accord, I probably wouldn\\'t have looked at other cars.Man tough crowd. In CA, the Cat is covered to over 100k by the emissions warranty, but a trans at 142k...man I don\\'t know if you can get mad at the car for that, especially since it was an auto.  I can think of only one word to describe the executives who decided to bring this \"BS\" car to Germany: idiots. (Also an apt word for anyone in Germany who would buy one.)If this is the best China can do, not even Chrysler has anything to fear.  Speaking of rear brakes, I see that the rear disc pads are half the size of the front ones ( 07 SE 4 cyl ).  Allen,Do you have any info on the \\'08 sport package for the Fusion? More specifically, the media guide states that it includes some suspension upgrades but doesn\\'t say what they are and I can\\'t find info anywhere.  you\\'ll just find some other excuse to not like the Fusionwell that excuse might just be the styling, but that is, of course, subjective. I\\'m sure there are a number of folks that like the razor blades and the high rump. If Ford chooses to use Mazda\\'s artificially aspirated 4 banger that obviously solves the HP deficiencies likely sacrificing some of that reliability that Ford is actually doing pretty well at right now. The \\'older\\' Mazda6 is reporting reliabilities several notches below the Fusion - don\\'t know if this is because of the turbo model, the fact that the 6 is made here, or a forecast of things to come for the Fusion. And you are right, there aren\\'t many \\'enthusiasts\\' that consider the Camry (except possibly the SE), that softer \\'Americanized\\' ride in the LE/XLE one of the reasons why the Camry is so absurdly successful although the SE V6 is something the enthusiast could drive with a smile on his face. While none of these cars could ever be a \\'sports\\' sedan, Mazdaspeed and the SE/SE-R trims of the Altima do their best imitations, \\'hiding\\' the inherent problems associated with FWD layouts.  I tested Camry, Accord, Mazda 6, Fusion, and Aura. The Aura was head and shoulders above all the other choices.Really? How? The Aura is a slow seller. What did you see to convince you to buy when others have punted, besides the huge incentives? Why does a car that\\'s \"head and shoulders above all the others\" need huge incentives to get it sold?  Do you have any info on the \\'08 sport package for the Fusion?It just says Sport Tuned Suspension which I take to mean slightly stiffer shocks/struts/springs to go along with the 18\" wheels.  Really? How? The Aura is a slow seller. What did you see to convince you to buy when others have punted, besides the huge incentives? Why does a car that\\'s \"head and shoulders above all the others\" need huge incentives to get it sold?I don\\'t think the sales data had much do with the other poster\\'s choice and coming to the decision the Aura was going to be the driver. FWIW, the Aura is a formidable family sedan, it has hurt by the non-availablity of I4 but otherwise a fine sedan. If the other poster thought the Aura was above others, then that\\'s his/her opinion, and there is no point to instigate it further.  Why do you have to question other people\\'s subjective preferences for a specific vehicle just because you don\\'t share that opinion?  It just says Sport Tuned Suspension which I take to mean slightly stiffer shocks/struts/springs to go along with the 18\" wheels.In the Contour SE it was stiffer springs and re-valved shocks and maybe a stiffer rear sway bar, so that sounds reasonable.  Did those changes make a big difference over non-SE Contours?  Did those changes make a big difference over non-SE Contours?For \\'95-97 they did. The \\'96 SE had a lower, more aggressive suspension than the \\'98 SVT. For the \\'98 model year, the great decontenting had begun and it was on its way to rental car-land. I was actually very impressed with the increase in handling and feel of the \\'96 SE over the LX and base, even the LX V6. I also think the package included 15\" alloys instead of 14\" in a more performance oriented size.  We have been using a 2007 Fusion \"S\" rental for two weeks tomorrow. It is a 4 cylinder 5 speed automatic. After a driving it a little over 1K miles this past 2 weeks I believe I will update my observations and since the transmission repair on our 95 Stratus should be finished today or tomorrow it will likely be my last.1. My initial observation of a noisy (induction noise) engine remains. we have become \"used\" to it but it there...constantly.2. The initial dislike of a high trunk and rear package shelf has become more intense. I cannot see adequately out the back when reversing into a parking stall and any car or obstacle behind is hard to see/judge the distance to.3. The ride and handling remains one of my favorite parts of this vehicle. The ride is taunt (on the firm but not harsh side) and handling is good with the Continental tires supplied. I did not push it beyond high normal type cornering however.4. The interior space is fairly large and the seats (the driver seat anyhow)is comfortable or was for me during a 300 mile drive on Saturday.5. The amount of standard features are sparse as compared to both a lower end 2006.5 Kia Optima and a 2006 Hyundai Sonata I recently rented.6. Engine performance is OK (adequate) and again comparing it to the Kia and Sonata (both 4 cylinders) feels slower with both Korean cars fairly jumping off the line and reving freely to the upper RPM ranges. Maybe it is the engine noise that makes the engine feel more strained than it is? 7. Fuel economy: I used this car as work car driving it back and forth to work which is a 12 mile one way drive for me. I have two traffic lights..#1 (almost always red coming from a secondary road onto US Rt. 30) and another on the military facility where I work. I have a total of two stop signs with usually NO or minimum wait for any amount of time at either. All roads traveled are 2 lane rural with the exception of a short (2 mile stretch of Rt 30). Speeds probably average 45-50 mph. All in all a much more free of \"hassles\" commute than most. So in addition to that we used it to putter around our small city (town really) after work. Typical stop and go with little or no gridlock...mostly \"no\". Drive to Wal Mart..drive to Circuit City..drive to a local resturant and eat supper kind of thing. we probably drove it a total of 35 to 40 mile a day including my 24 mile round trip to work. After a week and a bit over 1/2 of gas of that type of use I added 9.573 gallons and traveled 242.6 miles yielding 25.35 mpg.This past Saturday we drove it on a 300 mile road trip. I used the Pa Turnpike...I-81 and some \"secondary\" or rural 4 lane limited access highways. I kept the speed on the first part of the trip ( mostly because I had my 85 year old mother in the car)to less than 70 mph..about 68. Once we dropped her off at relatives the return trip was a bit faster @ 72-73 mph. All in all I was \"good\" with no abrupt increases of speed (A.K.A. road rage)no mountains this time and no luggage on the return. There were 3 of us on the first part and 2 on the return trip. I think that unless you slowed to 60 or 65 the car couldn\\'t be expected to get better mileage...in other words it was optimal for fuel economy. I refilled it with between 1/4 and 1/2 tank remaining used 10.003 gallons and drove 306.4 miles for an average of 30.64 mpgSummary: I probably wouldn\\'t buy one because of the above perceived (by me) faults. Handling and ride was good. Standard features were slim. Fuel economy was good/average for the size/engine. I guess here is where the Accord folks will say low because they get 34..whatever. It had no squeaks or rattles and quality was good from what I could see (paint seems good and fit and finish also good). Interior plastics were of the rubbery type in many places and I liked that. Ergonomics were less than good with the headlight switch low and to the far left on the dash and the radio was a \"park first to adjust\" type. Even after two weeks I still didn\\'t trust myself to adjust it while driving and always asked my wife to find a station etc. Steering wheel audio controls appreciated. I appreciated having a car these two weeks but in the end it was just that...a car.P.S. almost forgot safety (and that is important to me). If you are one who considers ABS, traction control, and ESC safety pluses this car doesn\\'t have them...any of them. One CAN get ABS as an option on all models and traction control as an option on V-6 models but not ESC. Not available yet on any model.  Nice review. Regarding the rear visibility - it took me about 6 weeks to get used to it. After that it\\'s not a problem. But it was a little disconcerting at first. Lack of some features is understandable since it\\'s a base S model. Lack of ESC and only average fuel economy are fair complaints.  A reverse sensing system is an option for 2008 Fusions in case you never get used to that high rear deck.   Lack of ESC and only average fuel economy are fair complaints.Like you Allen, I own one, a 2007 SEL AWD V6, and agree with your observation.  Except you\\'d be HAPPY with AVERAGE fuel economy. Right, Boz?    ESC safety pluses this car doesn\\'t have them...any of them.there is a reason for this - lack of a sophisticated enough braking system in the first place. Shooting juice (brake fluid) to individual brakes (as ESC will do) requires not only a yaw sensor to make a determination of when your car needs \\'help\\', the computer to make that decision for you (and administer the \\'fix\\'), but also an extra circuit in the brake system itself - neither of which the Fusion has even available. Given that the government is forcing these systems on us anyway, expect that Ford will have to \\'upgrade\\' their braking systems in the next model year or two. It is not that they can\\'t do it, ESC is available on other models - it may be more a function of not having the money to do it for the Fusion right now.  The rumor is they made a conscious marketing decision to go with AWD instead of ESC early on (when the competition wasn\\'t yet offering ESC) and couldn\\'t change it at the last minute. It should be fixed with the 09 refresh.  Why do you have to question other people\\'s subjective preferences for a specific vehicle just because you don\\'t share that opinion?Because I wonder what makes the Aura \"head and shoulders above\" the competition in their eyes. That\\'s what I already posted.I liked the Aura when I sat in it at the dealer but didn\\'t get the same superior vibe. Their opinion is backed by zero reasons why its better.Let\\'s hear why.  They do charge and how $263. I caught on to the brakes by checking the customer observations on I think MSN autos. A huge percentage of Honda owners reported brake problems on the 03. They made it right though.  Some people might be willing to take the plunge after one \"turnaround year,\" but I\\'m not one of them with Ford\\'s weak warranty; I\\'d rather get a GM! The only difference between Ford\\'s Fusion and GM\\'s Malibu or Aura warranties is that GM will give you more miles to use in those 5 years on the Malibu and Aura.Since the average is 12k miles per year for any of these cars it\\'s kind of useless and really only sounds good on paper when you really think about it. The number of people who can actually use those miles is pretty darn small. Ford also included \\'06 Fusions purchased after a certain date. It was a nice gesture by them and shows their confidence in current products. IIRC GM did not roll their warranty back for the Malibu, Aura or anything else.  what did you like most about it? Or better yet, what ways did you find it superior to other cars you shopped for. what surprissed you the most?First some background because I think it\\'s important to know where an opinion is coming from. I\\'m not a car guy. I\\'m 52 years old. I spend a lot of time stuck in Southern CA traffic. I buy a car, keep it for years, and pay little attention to the industry until it\\'s time to buy again. My last two purchases were new Accords, 1986 and 1998. I looked at no other cars.I went shopping with the following criteria in order of importance:Less than $25kQuiet ridesix cylinder engineexterior/interior stylevalue for the moneyI paid $22,845 plus tax/license for the Aura. For that I got a 252hp V6 engine, six speed auto transmission, 18 inch alloy wheels that look great, 4-wheel ABS disk brakes, stability control, front, side, and rear-side passenger airbags, a 200-something watt stereo with 8 speakers that sounds very nice, iPod integration with an aux input, OnStar, and a beautifully styled exterior and interior car. Just as important, I was able to get what I wanted without having to get other stuff I didn\\'t want like XM radio, faux wood interior trim, leather seats and a sunroof. Aura has a five star safety rating.The Aura\\'s ride was the quietest and most refined of all the cars I tested. It\\'s not like a Buick, but it doesn\\'t ride as hard/loudly as the Mazda or the Accord. It\\'s a perfect combination (for me) of road feel and quiet comfortable ride. When I set out on this trek, I was sure I wanted a Camry because of its well deserved reputation for reliability and quiet ride, even though I never did warm to the new (or older) design. I will say though, that the current exterior design is better looking than the previous generation.I prefer the Aura\\'s exterior styling to the Camry\\'s styling and I was immediately turned off by Camry\\'s center dashboard. It looked cheap (especially that plastic door that hides the Aux port for the iPod) and I didn\\'t like the style/coloring of the radio and climate control stuff. 100% subjective opinion. Others may disagree. Different strokes for different folks. Camry had a nice quiet ride, but I couldn\\'t get past that ugly dash. A comparably equipped Camry would have cost thousands more than the Aura. The current generation Accord is at the end of its life which was one of the reasons why I never seriously considered it. When the 08 model comes out I may regret that decision, but I doubt it. The spy photos I\\'ve seen on the internet haven\\'t caused buyer\\'s remorse. Honda just doesn\\'t build quiet rides in the Accord. The Mazda had the same problem: too hard/loud and it\\'s style-challenged to my eye. But I loved the wagon\\'s styling. That\\'s a very cool looking car, but it\\'s not a sedan.I liked the Fusion but it just lacks the panache that the Aura has. I really like the exterior design, but the interior left me uninterested and the model I drove didn\\'t have an aux connector or the salesman couldn\\'t find it. Having drooled at the Fusion\\'s I\\'ve seen in traffic, this was second on my list of cars to test. They have an eye-catching design.What surprised me most about the Aura was how great a value it is. It\\'s a great package. It does a lot of things well for a very good price. The other thing that surprised me was that I could be won over to an American car on its merits alone. The $2,250 in incentives played no part in my decision to buy. I would have gladly paid MSRP (no haggle pricing still in effect at Saturn). Before seeing/driving the Aura XR, I never dreamed I would buy it. I had to force myself to even consider it so great was my bias against American nameplates. Things have changed. GM is building some great cars now. Based on my experience, I\\'m convinced that there is a gap between the quality of these new models and buyers\\' perceptions which presents an opportunity to get a great car at a value price.GM is certainly aiming at the Japanese buyer with the Aura, but the car is more aligned with European imports. It is in fact, an Opel Vectra, a German car made in Kansas City. The Saab 9-3 shares the same platform as well. The interior design more closely resembles my friend\\'s Audi than any of the Japanese imports I considered and it\\'s ride is more like a Euro sports sedan. All the cars I tested are fine automobiles. You can\\'t go wrong purchasing any of them. It\\'s hard to make a bad decision in the mid-sized category any more because the cars are so good. The Aura met my objective and subjective requirements. It was a no-brainer.If you\\'re considering a Japanese import with a six cylinder engine, I would encourage you to consider the Aura. It\\'s an incredible value and a fine car. My wife drives a 2007 Nissan Maxima for work. She has always owned Japanese imports. She thinks the Aura is superior in every way to her Maxima with the exception of power which she thinks is a tie.Ultimately, deciding on a particular car is an emotional experience dependent on many factors which differ for all of us. The Aura and I just connected. Your mileage/criteria may vary. And that\\'s OK.  zzzoom6 - sorry for the late reply - was out of town for the weekend!drove a little more in the 9-3 sportcombi today. plenty of power - maybe a little more body lean than i\\'d like - but i bet the Aero would be better in that regards. its a slushbox, and i much prefer to row my own gears...so i dont really like the transmission - but im not being subjective on that :Pall in all - its a really nice car for what it is. we own a 9-2x Aero (2005) and we love that too (though its really a WRX wagon - we call it the saabaru!)-thene   But you don\\'t need reasons to have an opinion. That\\'s why they\\'re so handy....  Great review - spot on! I ended up with the Accord SE, which is much like the Aura XR package. They gave me a better trade-in and about the same or better discount off sticker when compared to Saturn deal. I slightly prefer the cornering and ride of the Accord, though the Aura does handle well. As for power, the Aura is like a rocket. Accord is good too, but Aura is great and the 6 sp. transmission with the paddles works well. The Aura seems a little smaller inside though. Seems like my knee hit the center column easier - just tighter feel overall. Do NOT like emergency brakes on the floor. Do like the DOHC 3.6 engine - lovely engine indeed. Steering is good - still prefer the slightly heavier Accord steering. The door window sills could be a tad lower on the Aura. I bet the New Accord for 2008 will have the too tall door syndrome as well. Overall though, the Aura is a pleasing car. I also like the Cadillac CTS and would not pass on a Corvette if someone gave me one. Can\\'t think off hand of other offering from GM at the moment which seem like winners in the car World, but perhaps another one will come to mind by tomorrow. The New Malibu will be a possible sucess and suck some sales from Aura. Currently the good, but not great XE Aura, I think takes away some luster from the New Saturn - New Aura image. But, as always, IMHO. The XE is NOT A BAD car, it is just something I think was not the thing to do, as it takes away from the more upscale image of Aura vs. the G6, vs. the New Malibu. The New Malibu, BTW will have the sexiest interior. :shades: Loren  Great post!! Exchanging this kind of information is what makes this discussion helpful to those in the midst of making a purchasing decision. Thanks for your contribution. Enjoy your new ride!   I, for one, am surprised that the Saturn/Opel Aura doesn\\'t get more ink in this forum. Also impressed with all aspects of the car (the XR) and particularly the 3.6, although I felt the interior fit and finish and egronomics a smidge below some of the \\'Japanese\\' competitors. Would be interested in your continuing observations on the car (FE?) as I look to replace a 4 year old Altima 3.5 I own. Like you perhaps, my biases definitely runs towards the \\'Japanese\\' side of things if only because of the great service I get out of them and some of those great V6s available, but this particular GM car is one that just might lead me to break a long tradition. Saturn, BTW, will also be \\'importing\\' another Opel design shortly to replace the Ion although FWIU it will be saddled with the \\'Ecotec\\' 4 banger.What I find difficult to understand is that we have 3 large mfgrs based in this country, all of which are in supposed financial difficulties, and only one of them seemingly can produce a car truly competitive in this segment. More and better choices especially from a car built in this country by a US based mfgr. would be a good thing! Don\\'t know if the Aura is quite strong enough to get me off the last 3 Altimas I\\'ve bought, but a serious contender. Enjoyed your \\'evenhanded\\' review, don\\'t be a stranger here   and only one of them seemingly can produce a car truly competitive in this segment.Just because YOU don\\'t like the Fusion doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not competitive.  A reporter would like to speak to owners who purchased a Honda or Toyota but didn&#146;t consider purchasing a domestic vehicle (specifically Ford or GM vehicle). Please respond to [email\\xa0protected] no later than July 24, 2007 with your daytime contact information.  I agree the Aura looks great. 18\" wheels tho? Check out the prices of replacing those. MPGs could be an issue, as it seems to be with GM. I\\'d like GM to do well in this sector. My apprehension with GM tho is how their cars will perform after 4+ years and 80,000+ miles on them. Lucky for me, folks like you will provide that answer to me down the road with your purchase today.  akirby - have said several times that I don\\'t believe the Fusion is competitive simply because of what\\'s under the hoods - something I also believe is easily confirmed by just reading the engine/FE specifications (and a test drive). Obviously an opinion nonetheless, that you Ford folks must take personally for some reason - you\\'ll note that I purposely didn\\'t mention the Fusion in this post because that is not what the post is about, it was about what appears to be a really good effort by a different \\'Detroit\\' mfgr.. If it was Ford that had the 3.6 instead of the Saturn, I would be talking about it in the same sort of terms as the Aura, believe it or not. Go out and drive the XR, other than some untamed torque steer (kinda like my wife\\'s Altima) you will find a wonderfully powerful car that also manages to be smooth and quiet - the way it should be.I think that it will be the 08 Malibu (because it should be a marginally cheaper and higher volume model) that will establish a \\'Detroit\\' benchmark in this class, and it is better for all of us, the autoworkers, and this country in general that both it, the Aura and even the Fusion do well.  My point is the Fusion is very competitive from an overall standpoint. The fact that it doesn\\'t meet your requirements doesn\\'t make it uncompetitive.I could just as easily say the Accord, Camry, Aura and Sonata are not competitive because they don\\'t offer AWD but that would be silly.Why can\\'t we use phrases like \"I don\\'t like\" or \"doesn\\'t meet my needs\" instead of \"not competitive\" or \"not as good\"?  I could just as easily say the Accord, Camry, Aura and Sonata are not competitive because they don\\'t offer AWD but that would be sillyyes, you could, and not be \\'silly\\'  at all and probably generate a more meaningful discussion on whether the benefits of AWD are worth what you pay for it at the gas pumps.  It would be silly because not everyone wants or needs AWD, just like not everyone wants or needs a 260 hp V6 or stability control or navigation or a hybrid or Sync - etc. etc. etc.What\\'s good or not good or competitive or not competitive is an individual, subjective decision based on personal preferences and is only meaningful based on a specific set of requirements.Everything else is just arguing that accomplishes nothing.  \"just like not everyone wants or needs a 260 hp V6\"Yes, but if it comes with equal or better fuel economy why wouldn\\'t you want it?  As I could say the Aura is not competitive in this class because it comes only with a V6, and not a more fuel-efficient and lower-cost I4. But that would be silly. It\\'s clearly competitive in the subclass of mid-sized V6 cars. And the Fusion/Milan are fully competitive in this class. Tops in class? Highly debatable. But competitive? Certainly.  Well it competes - it just can\\'t win. The Fusion is a good car, but not as good as the best.Loren  Apparently it wins 12K-15K times every month.  Yes, but if it comes with equal or better fuel economy why wouldn\\'t you want it? exactly, but maybe we should add \\'sound and feel good doing it\\'? My wife pulls 25-26 mpg overall out of her 03 Altima 3.5, I pull a bit better than that out of my slightly heavier, bigger, and more powerful 05 Avalon - if we can have our cake, let\\'s enjoy eating it as well! It all boils down to engine efficiencies and sophistication - those cars that have those kind of things are \\'competitive\\' those that don\\'t aren\\'t. And I personally can\\'t understand anybody that somehow wouldn\\'t \\'care\\' or FTM would take less when more is certainly available for about the same (net) costs.   And I personally can\\'t understand anybody that somehow wouldn\\'t \\'care\\' or FTM would take less when more is certainly available for about the same (net) costs. For \"looks\", AWD, and brand loyalty. That\\'s the only reasons I can think of.  What are the retail sales & discounts given on the Fusion?  75-80% retail, $500-$1000 rebates. It\\'s had a $500 rebate since day one even when supplies were short so I have to believe Ford simply built that into the pricing because some domestic buyers just won\\'t buy without some type of rebate.  The Fusion is a good car, but not as good as the best. unless reliability is the most important factor for a customer and they read that the fusion is the best in that category. or maybe they like the styling the best. or perhaps they feel better that it has AWD... I could go on and on, but who is any one of us to say what would be best for everyone else or to judge which car or drivetrain is \"competitive\" or not? as biased as I am toward Honda, Mazda, and Subaru, I could not, in good conscience, say that any of the cars listed above are not good cars. if a friend drove up in an Aura, Fusion, or Jetta, I would not say that they were dumb and tell them how much better my car was ...I\\'d ask them what they liked about it and congratulate them on making a choice that made them happy.  OK, let me ask you this, would you buy a Fusion for less than a $3,000 off the sticker? What do you consider a good buy price on the Fusion V6. Would it be a value at the same cost of a discounted Accord SE or an Aura XR at say around $22,500 ? Are you at all worried about Ford\\'s future as a company?As for looks, yeap, the Fusion or even better the Milan look pretty sharp, with a bit of tall butt. Did a brief drive test and the steering feels pretty darn good, with good engine and transmission performance. Overall, it was an OK car. The interior is good, but there is better. I would not pass it up if someone gave me one. :shades: I pretty much looked at all the cars in this class. Most impressive, IMHO, was the Aura XR and the Accord SE, especially the V6. The Altima, with CVT wasn\\'t my cup o\\' tea, and I really disliked the emergency brake location. Push button start is something different. The Sonata is OK, but when pushed, like on a rough road, the suspension seemed like it was bottoming or making sounds of such. Steering was good, but not great. Seemed like an 85% car compared to the best or best tested. If you weight things like handling the most, I liked the Honda, then Aura, and Fusion. The Altima seemed a bit more noisey, with good cornering, but too light a steering feel about it. Accord and Fusion have better feel. I know, opinions, as some will prefer heavier feel.Loren  Well I would too. Would say, let\\'s go for a spin in the new car. This being a car forum, people are going to have to come to some conclusions on cars they have tested, and will have opinions on those cars. If a car is a best car if it does one or two tricks well, that\\'s fine - no problem. It is your money, so if a car is a Yugo and ya like, once again that is fine. I should have qualified the first statement. The sum of all the cars design, looks, seats, drive train, abilities, resale, value, warranty, interior, exterior, safety equipment, standard features, you know from the hood prop to the gas cap = all inclusive, IMHO it is not the best of best. If you add only what is important to you and can live with the total cost to own, then fine, what the hey, it is number one.Loren  I noticed that some feel that the Fusion isn\\'t competitive. I have driven one and feel that it is a very nice driving vehicle and has a nice interior with a lot of front seat room for a midsize. However, where it falls short as many others have noted is the engine. Its all been said before but IMO that is what kills the car.  In terms of MSRP a loaded V6 Fusion isn\\'t that much off from the V6 Cam/Cord/Alt. So if Ford didn\\'t offer rebates and deep disounts at the dealer the Fusion wouldn\\'t be competitive at all because it would be the same price as the rest with less power, FE, safety features, and creature comforts.  Update:We went out again last evening. At this point, my wife is dead-set to get a manual, whether or not it\\'s AWD. After test-driving a slushbox or two, she just can\\'t give up the manual (which makes me VERY proud, BTW!)\\'07 Mercury Milan Premier (4-cylinder, 5-speed manual): Yes, it\\'s rare to have a Premier model with the 4-cylinder and 5-speed, but they\\'re out there. Same initial impressions as before, but the 4-cylinder is a little more coarse than both the DT3.0 and the 2.5 4-cyl from the Altima. The 5-speed is pretty smooth to operate, but the car should either have a 6th gear or the gearing revised, because it revs higher than the 2.5S 6-speed at highway velocities, and I\\'m sure it affects both the NVH and fuel economy. The loaded Premier for the same price as the mid-grade 2.5S (without leather) was enticing though...After discussion over dinner, and reviewing the online offers from a couple different Nissan dealers, we decided to get the 2.5S. Why? That\\'s easy: 1. Great gas mileage (26 city, 35 hwy, which matches the current 2000 Neon 5-speed that she drives now)2. Very nice interior (IMO about five levels higher than the embarrasing interior that my mother has in her \\'03, with richer materials and excellent fit-and-finish)3. The 6-speed manual (which is smooth and easy to operate, isn\\'t notchy, and feels better than my 5-speed in my Mazda6)4. Firm but nice ride, and excellent handling (better than everything else save my Mazda6, IMO)After comparing the local dealer offers, we ended up at the closest dealer to us, which is a small, family-run business that\\'s been around for over 30 years selling Datsun/Nissan. My wife and I placed a deposit on an \\'07 Altima. It\\'s the 2.5S, 6-speed manual, Majestic Blue with the Charcoal cloth interior, with the Convenience Plus package (leather wheel and shifter, power drivers seat, moonroof, 16\" alloy rims, etc.) and floor mats. Despite the fact that it has to come from Connecticut (I\\'m in upstate NY), it\\'s EXACTLY what my wife wants (yes, both she and I both currently drive and love a three-pedal car).It\\'ll be shipped by early next week, and ready for pick-up by the 28th.We are VERY happy both with the car itself and the purchase experience, and hope to have excellent luck with it in the future.  would you buy a Fusion for less than a $3,000 off the sticker?Price never entered into the equation. I don\\'t shop on price - I buy whatever I like and try to get the best price on that. I\\'m too picky about styling and features. Before the Fusion debuted I had decided to get an Accord. But the Fusion had the looks and features I wanted and it had a unique Piano Black interior trim and unique Tungsten grey paint that I still think looks fantastic. Would I have bought it if it was the same price as the Accord? Sorry to disprove your theory but the answer is yes.If you think that people only buy Fusions and Milans because they are cheaper you\\'re mistaken. People who want cheap would be buying Kias.  In terms of MSRP a loaded V6 Fusion isn\\'t that much off from the V6 Cam/Cord/Alt.True, but it is a good bit cheaper to buy than a loaded Camry or Accord V6 which would give us an apples to apples comparison then.   \"good bit cheaper to buy\"That is exactly my point. If it wasn\\'t cheaper to buy it wouldn\\'t be doing nearly as well, because of it\\'s shortcomings.  Why can\\'t we just be not so particular, or fussy about who, how, or what is said?  It\\'s had a $500 rebate since day one even when supplies were short so I have to believe Ford simply built that into the pricing because some domestic buyers just won\\'t buy without some type of rebate. a condition that the \\'American\\' manufacturers have \\'taught\\' the American carbuyer - if they are going to shop those brands, they EXPECT larger rebates (and other incentives) as you say - something that Buick, for example, specializes in - overpricing a car with those \\'built-in\\' rebates. The Camcord shopper, OTH, is doing well to get close to invoice (except possibly on EOY model changes). And then we wonder why those \\'Detroit\\' brands don\\'t hold their resale values that well, so much so that even the steep discounts can\\'t make them cheaper to own than those Camcords they \\'compete\\' with. And part of the reason why Ford/GM/Chrysler are losing money faster than it can be printed? Wouldn\\'t it be nice for those same mfgrs. if they made a car that was good enough and/or in demand (the two kinda go together) enough that MSRP and invoice meant something?  Small rebates ($1K or less) don\\'t really hurt, especially if they\\'re consistent. What hurts is adding $2K-$3K in rebates later. That reduces the resale values across the board and that is what has happened in the past. It will take years to get the buying public off the rebate wagon. Interestingly Honda and Toyota are increasing rebates on some models (Odyssey and Tundra, not Camcords) and given the reliability records of the 06/07 models so far it sounds like the tables may be slowly turning.  Why can\\'t we just refrain from saying things that are misleading or incorrect or stating opinions as facts?  The Camcord shopper, OTH, is doing well to get close to invoice (except possibly on EOY model changes).

Wouldn\\'t it be nice for those same mfgrs. if they made a car that was good enough and/or in demand (the two kinda go together) enough that MSRP and invoice meant something?Actually my fleet safety weekly email had a blurb about how the costs in the rental car industry are skyrocketing because there is no longer the dumping vehicles to fleet sales there has been in the past. Other than a cost increase for rentals, I don\\'t see this adversely affecting the overall market so much.They also had a blurb about how GM and Ford residuals percentages increased by double digits in the last year, crediting the Fulan/Edge.  Good post - congrats! Let us know how delivery goes.  Congratulations! Awesome choice with the 6-speed. I didn\\'t even look at these when I bought my Accord in February, because I knew I\\'d want one! The Accord was also on my short list and since they were all marked $300 under invoice at the local dealer, and the Altimas were brand new and selling for MSRP, the deal made the final choice for me.RE: the Milan... you stated: \"The 5-speed is pretty smooth to operate, but the car should either have a 6th gear or the gearing revised, because it revs higher than the 2.5S 6-speed at highway velocities, and I\\'m sure it affects both the NVH and fuel economy.\" When I drove the Fusion 5-speed I never got to highway speeds, what RPM was it running?At 80 MPH my Accord is spinning 3,000. I\\'t doesn\\'t bother me because NVH isn\\'t an issue, and my old 626 V6 used to spin 4,000 at the same speed (7k redline).What RPM does the Nissan 2.5 6-speed turn in 6th?  When I drove the Fusion 5-speed I never got to highway speeds, what RPM was it running? Crap, you had to ask me that... I don\\'t remember exactly (since my wife was driving at the time), but IIRC, I THINK it was 3500 RPM at 75 MPH (give or take).What RPM does the Nissan 2.5 6-speed turn in 6th?I don\\'t recall this one, but it was quieter than the Milan (in terms of engine noise) at speed. Between that, the 35 MPG rating for highway (compared to 31 for the Milan), and the extra cog, I\\'ll assume that it\\'s lower than the Milan. I could be wrong, but I\\'ll find out for sure when I get the car.  and why I guy like me is just not going to want to buy one at this point, is long term reliability. When you\\'ve owned GM cars for a while, you start to learn that at first, everything seems great. At the time, my Intrigue was sort of the equivalent of what the Aura is today. It beat Camry in a CD comparo back in the day. It was Detroit\\'s great hope. But what gradually drove people away was long term reliability. After a couple of years, things just starting going wrong. And wrong. And wrong. And so on. And now the same thing has started happening to our \\'04 Malibu Maxx. And the same thing happened to my wife\\'s \\'00 Alero a few years ago.Is the \\'08 Aura a better car than those were? Well, generationally speaking, I don\\'t know that you can say that. Its hardly groundbreaking considering its competition. But sure, its appealing. At this point, though, I want PROOF that it will hold up for a good 7-8 years. And obviously we won\\'t get that proof for a while.So I\\'d really hesitate to buy it.  I want PROOF that it will hold up for a good 7-8 years. And obviously we won\\'t get that proof for a while.So I\\'d really hesitate to buy it.There\\'s no way any mid-size car manufacturer can meet that standard, since the 2007 or 2008 or 2009 model is going to be considerably different than a 2000, 2001 or 2002 model.Assuming the Honda Accord to be the best 2000, there is no guarantee that the much-altered 2007 will equal its reliability, endurance, etc. because so many changes will have been made in the interim.Cars are like stocks: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Buying any new mid-size is a crap shoot. Some makes and models are going to be better than others, no matter what.The 2007 Aura might be the best mid-size sedan GM has ever built and it may be trouble-free into 2014 but that doesn\\'t necessarily mean that the 2014 model will fare as well.  I don\\'t agree, and neither does Consumer Reports (I know! I uttered the dreaded CR!)If a manufactuer--say, Honda--consistenly builds reliable cars, every year, than there is a much, much greater chance--both statistically and rhetorically--that they will continue to do so. CR is generally willing to give reliability recommendations on new models when the previous model performed very well for the life of the car for that reason, and past performance is a very reliable indicator of (no pun intended) reliability.And really, this goes beyond mid-size cars. General Motors, for instance, has consistent long term reliability issues across all models--many of them are shared-component problems (ie, brakes). That could well change, but it will be a while before we know. It doesn\\'t take 7-8 years (though I did mention that), I think we\\'ll probably have a good idea in 3-4 or so. But what I speak of is an overall problem. According to many CSR\\'s at GM dealers I\\'ve spoken with (and, unfortunately, I\\'ve gotten to know them very well), the problems we\\'ve experienced with our Malibu also show up on G6, Trailblazer, the minivans, etc. They\\'re more systematic than anything else.The other issue which I didn\\'t bring up is how a manufacturer treats these issues when they do come up. GM\\'s got a ways to do here, also.  One thing with Honda is they excel at everything they build. Be it cars, motorcycles, marine engines, lawn equipment, jet skis, etc.Several of Honda\\'s outboard marine engines use basically what is in their cars. THe civic 4cyl is used in Honda\\'s medium HP outboards and the Odyssey 3.5L v6 is the basis for the 225hp Honda outboard. If an engine can hold up to marine use and can pretty much withstand anything. Honda is always one of the tops in reliability in the marine category too. Amazingly, a HOnda 225hp outboard engine costs more than a whole civic.  Didn\\'t something similiar happen with the Saturn L-series? Winning awards, receiving praise in road tests, etc... until the problems started surfacing. I think it took a couple of years before the major ones came out.Of course, as mentioned above, this is no gaurantee of how the Aura or any other GM built today will fare into the future. But past performance is really all we have to go by as far as estimating long-term reliability. How well can we estimate that? Probably not too well.An interesting note: during my short stint as a car salesman, I sold a Mustang GT automatic to a middle-aged man who used to calibrate the machines used to build engines at Ford. He was very specific on getting the 4.6L V8 instead of any other Ford engine for \"durability purposes.\" He had no interest in the performance potential, and his wife was going to be the main driver. On the test drive, she didn\\'t even rev it past 2,500 RPM. He stated, and I can\\'t remember his source, that when domestic companies engineered car parts, they set certain ranges for the various parameters the engineers had to work with: what materials may be used, how much the finished part would cost to make, and how long it would last.The funny thing was, he told me, that if the part was designed outside of the ranges either way... too expensive OR too cheap, wears out too fast in testing OR lasts too long... it was rejected. They didn\\'t want their cars to last too long or their parts sell too cheap.Is this true? I certainly don\\'t know, and I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever. But after my experience with my 2004 Ford, it certainly wouldn\\'t surprise me.  If a manufactuer--say, Honda--consistenly builds reliable cars, every year, than there is a much, much greater chance--both statistically and rhetorically--that they will continue to do so.Only makes sense to me as well - and it works in both directions. CR, for whatever fault or differences we all might have with their particular priorities, is the only organization I know of that does things like reliability studies/comparison tests/satisfaction surveys and is not beholden to anybody for whatever results they come up with. As such it should be taken seriously by those consumers valuing an \\'intelligent\\' purchase decision. I have noticed that CR does have a tendency to \\'recommend\\' a car earlier than they might otherwise if it happens to be from a mfgr. that has a superior track record as opposed to one that doesn\\'t. I have no problem with this, but we probably also need to understand that sooner or later all things change and that as all cars are improving from a reliability standpoint,that this (reliability) may eventually become a non-factor especially for those of us that usually buy our cars new. It wasn\\'t all that long ago that a car was deemed junk at 50 or 60k (and generally was), nowadays that\\'s barely broken in...  Let\\'s be sure to keep the focus on the cars themselves, please...  It\\'s not all that hard to understand at all. Having to take a car back to the dealer for warranty service a half dozen or so times is easily accomplished when your dealing with a service department that leaves a little to be desired. Also, they never stock any parts, even for the Accord.So thats 2 visits for one thing, and if that one thing goes wrong twice, that\\'s 4 visits already!!! You can reach 6 to 8 visits easy. The reason I still consider HOnda\\'s to be bulletproof are many:1) It was a first year model and not built in Japan2) The japanese built/assembled Civics we\\'ve had have been bulletproof and required no return visits, thats is 0 visits.3) It was for things like window moldings rippling and wrinkling and a powerseat that functioned but \"bumped\" a tad bit at the end of its \"track.\" I\\'m picky.4) It had two rattle sources to deal with.These are forgiveable offenses; what isn\\'t forgiveable are things that leave you stranded because the car won\\'t start (never happened with any Honda) or things that cost you money you shouldn\\'t have to spend (Honda steps up if something does go wrong, even after warranty).So Hip hip hooray for Honda!  But, alas... I did go with a German car, and I might not have if the Accord had been perfect rather than near perfect.  After discussion over dinner, and reviewing the online offers from a couple different Nissan dealers, we decided to get the 2.5SExcellent choice. I checked it out at the dealer too when buying my weekend beater, an 06 Frontier, a few months ago. The interior is much nicer and I love the looks of the car. Nissan got it right again. They build a great product.  I think I posted the same kind of comments about Saturn the other day. 2008 will be a big year for GM - the new CTS,Malibu etc. Let\\'s review these cars in 2012 and see what we come up with, but GM\\'s track record for so many years has been above average, which doesn\\'t seem to cut it when there are so many excellents out there.  Yes, but if it comes with equal or better fuel economy why wouldn\\'t you want it? My sentiments exactly!!!Why would I pay X amount of dollars for 200 HP and 30 MPG when I can get (for about the same amount of money) 250 HP and 31 MPG? It\\'s a tough sell.You have to do a X-$$$ equation to get it to be considered by anyone paying attention.  For me, buying a car is not like buying stocks, but more like a well researched diversified investment.There is traceable accurate history on all makes and models. And history shows certain companies to be quite dependable, reliable, and consistant.This is shown for years and years, and can therefore lead to solid predictions. It is sort of like a batter that hits for a .330+ average 10 years in a row. Do you really think in year 11 he\\'s going to hit under .300?  ...So in your opinion, the resale value of the new Tundra is horrible because they almost immediately went to $3000 rebates or 0% financing due to sub-par sales?  I am torn between these 2 cars and looking for input.They are both approx $24k plus tax, tag and title.2007 Altima 3.5SE manual2007 Mazdaspeed6 Sport manualcomments?can i get better deals on either of these cars?  Wow!.....An Olds Intrigue, Olds Alero, and a Malibu Maxx. That\\'s like, the all time trifecta of bad cars. The only thing that\\'s missing is a 2001 Pontiac Aztec or something. I\\'m not saying all GM cars are crap, but common.  I am torn between these 2 cars and looking for input. They are both approx $24k plus tax, tag and title. 2007 Altima 3.5SE manual 2007 Mazdaspeed6 Sport manual That would be a tough one. The Mazda looks better, but the Altima would probably have more room inside. I would go with the Altima, mainly because it\\'s a V6.  History would have said the Fusion would have first year problems and Camcords would not have transmission problems or sludged engines. Not to mention all the 2005 Toyota recalls.So which history do you go by? Pre-2005 or Post-2005? Don\\'t you think post-2005 is a better predictor for 2008?  History would have said the Fusion would have first year problems and Camcords would not have transmission problems or sludged engines.The Camcord problems affected what? A tenth of a tenth of a percent of their sales? I had multiple, major headaches with my 96 Taurus. I\\'ll go with Honda\\'s legacy all day. Ford\\'s legacy is tainted bigtime in my house. I\\'ll ever buy another one. Any domestic consideration goes to GM.  I bought the MazdaSpeed6 but didn\\'t cross shop the Altima because, to me, they are significantly different cars. I prefer the Mazda\\'s smaller size and AWD was important to me. We did look at the Altima when we bought my wife\\'s A4 Quattro; again the smaller size and AWD won out. I still think that the Altima is a good car, just depends on what features are most important to you.  \" dittos \" go for the Altima. New car too.  Wow!.....An Olds Intrigue, Olds Alero, and a Malibu Maxx. That\\'s like, the all time trifecta of bad cars. The only thing that\\'s missing is a 2001 Pontiac Aztec or something. I\\'m not saying all GM cars are crap, but common. The Olds intrigue was actually a good car. My brother has the 3.5L DOHC engine and its quite smooth unlike the 3800 engine. But the Alero is junk you are correct.  sounds like the perfect car for your wife! thanks for your reviews; knowing you own a 6, it\\'s easier for me to relate when you talk about the Altima\\'s handling. post pics when you get a chance. and if your 6 makes it into the pics too, all the better! your wife probably can\\'t wait to get into it and wave goodbye to the neon... exciting times!  definitely a tough call... both are very fast, have good suspensions for solid handling, good transmissions in both. perhaps AWD might be an issue depending on where you live and how much you push the car when cornering (I\\'m of the view that an AWD car can be pushed harder quicker after the apex than a FWD car could). I\\'ve heard in the recent past that the mazdaspeed6 could be had for 5k+ off msrp, but I don\\'t know if that\\'s still the case... geuss it depends on where you live and the availability of this model in your market. I\\'d say the MS6 would have a tiny bit of a performance edge especially in steering feel, cornering and braking and it looks slightly better (and I think will \"age\" better) but the Altima would probably have more creature comforts since it has more room, push start, quieter, and slightly softer suspension. So I geuss it comes down to how much sportiness do you want in your sporty sedan? btw... have you looked at the legacy gt?  \"...So in your opinion, the resale value of the new Tundra is horrible because they almost immediately went to $3000 rebates or 0% financing due to sub-par sales? \"Look at it logically (and this works for any vehicle):You have a one year old model, and it is totaled, stolen, or you just had to sell/trade... the value of your car as determined by most pricing books, an insurance adjuster, used car manager, appraiser or private buyer, etc. will roughly be:The average selling price of a brand new model, less any incentives currently available, minus a percentage (say, 10-30% based on other factors of depreciation such as current demand and past history).So if the new versions of your one year old model are still selling well at close to MSRP with no incentives, your resale value will be just fine. Alternately, if the new models are selling at invoice or less plus have heavy incentives, than the value of your one year old model has to be adjusted down accordingly. In the case of the Tundra, I\\'d say yes, their resale value won\\'t be great (maybe not horrible, but not great) until Toyota stops the discounting and/or incentives.I\\'ll admit, I think this means that right now, my 2007 Accord with 6k miles is worth slightly less than a 2007 Altima with 6k miles, because an Altima with the same MSRP will cost you more new (less discounts, no factory to dealer incentives that I am aware of). That\\'s OK, because I paid less. However, later this year when the 2008 Accords are out and the deals on the 2007s have dried up, the two 2007 cars should be roughly equal in resale value again.Of course this is all relative... If you bought your car before any discounting/incentives began or just didn\\'t buy right, then you\\'ll be more affected than someone who took advantage of all the discounts/incentives. \"Bigh high / sell low\" versus \"buy low / sell low.\"Cars are not investments, but if you buy the right car sometimes you can \"buy low / sell high.\"  Once again you\\'re using a 10 yr old vehicle for comparison. It\\'s not 1996 anymore and there is no comparison between a 96 Taurus and a 06 Fusion from a reliability standpoint.  I am torn between these 2 cars and looking for input.They are both approx $24k plus tax, tag and title.2007 Altima 3.5SE manual2007 Mazdaspeed6 Sport manualcomments?can i get better deals on either of these cars?Oh mannnn I so want a MazdaSpeed6. But alas, the features and content of the Altima 3.5SE are probably considerably more than that of the \"spartan(?)\" MazdaSpeed sport. After comparing a bit, maybe I take that back, the sunroof, leather, heated seats, etc are optional on both, and the MS6 actually come standard with the HID and Bose, while the Altima makes you kick down for it.  Ha...well, one of the three, yes--the Alero was not a well built or particulary well executed car, though it did look pretty decent.I had an Intrigue with the 3.5L. It WAS a good car--fun to drive, very good powertrain, nice features. It just didn\\'t hold up well. The Maxx is also pretty well designed--there is an amazing amount of room in it, its very useful, fuel efficient and a good value. Again, durability is a problem--particularly the brakes. But we\\'ll be holding on to that car for a while--it only has 26k.My point here though is that you can\\'t have a discussion about these cars without considering the history of their manufacturer. Some have more to prove than others.And btw--overall first year reliability of the Camry has been above average. And I\\'m willing to bet it will be for the Accord too. The Fusion has been a pleasant surprise, but I\\'d still want to see data from the next couple of years before being completely confident. I\\'d be probably be a little more predisposed to like the Fusion if not for those ridiculous, inaccurate, unethical \"challenge\" ads they show in which they compare to a loaded Fusion to a stripped 4 cyl Camry and Accord and then claim that the Fusion \"wins.\" Yeah, no kidding.  Oh no, please not the Fusion Challenge again...I agree it was flawed, but we\\'ve beat it to death already.  \"It\\'s not 1996 anymore and there is no comparison between a 96 Taurus and a 06 Fusion from a reliability standpoint\"It\\'s the same 3.0 V6 isn\\'t it?  No, it\\'s not the same 3.0 V6. The block may be the same but that\\'s about it.  a loaded Fusion to a stripped 4 cyl Camry and Accord and then claim that the Fusion \"wins.\" Yeah, no kidding.I\\'m only going to point out that the test was between fully loaded top of the line V6 models, not stripped 4 cylinders. The Accord and Camry had stability control while the Fusion had AWD for the same price. That was the only difference.  I know its petty but the only difference I know of, is that it now uses VVT to bump up the HP a little. Anyway, I do see your original point. However, (IMO) the reason the Fusion is doing well reliability wise has a lot to do with the kinks being worked out of that powertrain over the last 10 years. Kind of like the GM vehicles using the 3.8  But with VVT comes totally new heads, new intake, new PCM, etc. It\\'s actually an updated version of the 3.0L that debuted on the 2000 Lincoln LS and Jag Stype which is when the VCT was added. And don\\'t forget there was an OHV 3.0L Vulcan engine in the Taurus back in 1996 also.  However, (IMO) the reason the Fusion is doing well reliability wise has a lot to do with the kinks being worked out of that powertrain over the last 10 years.I consider that to be a positive, not a negative.  From Wikipedia:\"Ford Motor Company\\'s modern 2.5 L and 3.0 L V6 automobile engines are evolutions of the same design, first used in the 1994 Ford Mondeo. This line is sold under the brand name \"Duratec\", as are many other engines.The Mondeo V6 is a modern aluminum DOHC V6 with a 60° bank angle. The primary engineering input came from Porsche, who were developing a similar V6 before selling the engineering to Ford, and Cosworth, who helped with cylinder head manufacturing. The Jaguar AJ-V6 engine is similar but adds variable valve timing. Mazda\\'s AJ version also has this feature.\"Duratec 30\"The 3.0 L Duratec 30 or Mazda AJ was introduced in 1996 as a replacement for the 232 in³ (3.8 L) Essex V6 in the Taurus/Sable. It has 2967 cc of displacement and produces between 200 and 240 hp (150 and 180 kW). The same basic engine is used in the Jaguar S-Type, Lincoln LS, Mazda MPV, Mazda6, Mondeo ST220 and many other Ford vehicles. It is essentially a bored-out (to 89 mm) Duratec 25 and is built in Ford Motor Company\\'s Cleveland, OH #2 plant. A slightly modified version for the Ford Five Hundred entered production at the Cleveland, OH #1 plant in 2004.There are two key versions of the Duratec 30:DAMB - The Lincoln LS and Jaguar AJ30 versions have direct-acting mechanical bucket (DAMB) tappets. Output is 232 hp (173 kW) at 6750 RPM with 220 ft·lbf (298 N·m) of torque at 4500 rpm. RFF - The Taurus/Sable/Escape version uses roller finger followers (RFF) instead and produces 201 hp (150 kW) at 5900 RPM with 207 ft·lbf (281 N·m) of torque at 4400 rpm.The 2006 Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan, and Lincoln Zephyr feature a version of the Duratec 30 utilizing variable valve timing. The engine has an output of 221 hp (165 kW) at 6250 rpm, and 205 ft·lbf (278 N·m) of torque at 4800 rpm.A Twin-turbocharged version of this engine is used in the Noble M400, a British supercar. The engine is rebuilt and tuned to a max power of 425 bhp @ 6500 rpm, with a torque figure of 390 ft·lbf @ 5000 rpm. Noble has used forged pistons, an oil cooler, a larger baffled oil sump and extra cooling ducts to maintain its durability.Mazda\\'s MZI version adds variable valve timing, as does Jaguar\\'s AJ30. Note that the MZI name is also used in Europe on Mazda\\'s version of the Ford Sigma I4. The 3.0 L, 226 hp V6 used in the Mondeo ST220 is called Duratec ST. The 3.0 L, 204 hp V6 in the Mondeo Titanium is called Duratec SE.\"  Not to mention all the 2005 Toyota recallsWhat recalls would those be? Don\\'t think they actually recalled even the sludging problem they had on the previous generation of V6s. Recalls, in fact, tend to be related to safety issues. There has been a whole 1 recall on my 05 Avalon TMK (a steering column weld) and a coupla of non-safety related TSBs (Tranny programming and a timing chain cover leak). The car is actually doing better (after over 50k) that I would have anticipated being a completely new car with, at that time, an unproven drivetrain. Broke a cardinal rule (never buy a truly new model its first year), and only something that I would\\'ve even considered with a Toyota/Honda/Nissan product. So far so good. The same thing with a GM/Ford/Chrysler product? No way, I\\'ll continue to trust a long established history!  \"I consider that to be a positive, not a negative\"Depends how you look at it. On one hand you use an old powertrain to make your \"new\" vehicle reliable during its launch. On the other hand you end up with a vehicle that has 50 less HP, less refinement (IMO) and gets the same or worse FE compared to the competition.  Depends how you look at it. On one hand you use an old powertrain to make your \"new\" vehicle reliable during its launch.You are correct, it does depend on how you look at it. I prefer to see this particular glass of water as being half full instead of half empty. The refined 3.0-liter, 221-horsepower V6 Duratec engine in our 2007 Fusion produces plenty of \"git up and go,\" is smooth and quiet while doing so.Gas mileage, however, is not so good when coupled with AWD. It\\'s 14.8 in all-city driving after seven months and 3,700 miles on the car. The revised EPA estimate for this power train is 17 mpg city; 24 mpg highway. Nothing to write home about.Without AWD, 3.0-liter V6 owners typically get 20 mpg in town, according to the forums I visit. I fully expect this 2007 Fusion to last seven or eight years.  I think the comparisson was between an AWD Fusion and 2WD Accord / Camrys. I think the logic was that the Fusion tested would still cost less than the Accord / Camrys tested. Would it be more fair to compare the 2WD Fusion that costs 4 grand less than the competitors? I dont know, but you have to admit, the Fusion is pretty good for what it is.......  ...just dont ever try to trade out of the Mazdaspeed6. Trust me sir, I have experience concerning trading one in, and it aint pretty.  Yes Sir. That\\'s pretty much my point. Rebates dont really have a bad effect unless you didn\\'t get them when you bought yours. If you can avoid the \"buy high / sell low\" situation, you can pretty much take the depreciation factor out of consideration on any vehicle you want to buy. Unless it\\'s just absolutely outrageous depreciation like the Korean cars / Suzukis / Isuzus / Mitsubishis / and certain domestics, namely most Dodges and some unpopular GM and Ford cars.  guess youi must have owned that same Mazda 6 that one poster was claiming was worth more than he paid for it because silly Edmund\\'s said so? It does surprise me thought that the depreciation hit would be as severe with the Mazdaspeed, a niche vehicle if there ever was one.  the prices seem about right for both, and both cars with a manual tranny be ready for a little tugging at the steering wheel. The Altima rates near (or at the top of its class -including Accords) depreciation wise - so if you are not likely to be keeping the car for 7+ years,the Altima should win hands down from a cost to own perspective. The Nissan VQ is still perhaps the most proven and reliable V6 available , while I\\'d be hesitant to buy a turbocharged anything. And yes, I own a 03 3.5SE (auto) 25-26 mpg overall, 75k, and never been back to the dealer for anything - the way it should be. EXCEPT for some collison repairs after my wife got rearended - which is how I found out about the resale values, the darn insurance co. wouldn\\'t total it because THEY thought it was still worth substantially more than the $11k it took to fix it. The wife, of course, had her heart set on a new 07 model at the time and STILL DOES even though they did a good job on the repairs. Somehow, I think I\\'m going to lose this battle - again! I did get a chance to drive the new 08, found that the interior quality/fit & finish had improved tremendously - thought the CVTs behavior was a bit disconcerting, although I know she would love it - it is smoooooth. MTXs, of course, in big city traffic, out of the question for her and me.  Same basic engine is true - it\\'s the same block and maybe bottom end, but as you can see there are multiple versions with very different top end components.  A niche car like no other. About 22 grand at best once it rolls off the lot.  I am torn between these 2 cars and looking for input. They are both approx $24k plus tax, tag and title. 2007 Altima 3.5SE manual 2007 Mazdaspeed6 Sport manual boy, that is a tough one. If its performance you want, I\\'d have to go with the altima. Gotta love that VQ. But, if your primary concern is price, you\\'d almost deffinitly get the 6 either for less, or same with more options.  boy, that is a tough one. If its performance you want, I\\'d have to go with the altima. Gotta love that VQ.I would definitely reverse that. For performance I would go for the AWD/Turbo. It runs like a mild mannered grocery getter until you get into boost, and then you feel yourself getting pressed into the seatback mmm.  I am torn between these 2 cars and looking for input.They are both approx $24k plus tax, tag and title.2007 Altima 3.5SE manual2007 Mazdaspeed6 Sport manual ****You could also look at the Subaru WRX TR. Cars Direct has them for about 22.5K as well, and it\\'s a much better choice than either of those two, IMO. That also leaves enogh room to get a couple of handling and interior goodies thrown in and still be under $24K.#2 of course is my favorite, the RX-8. It\\'s the best car for $24K than you can get aside from *maybe* the WRX. Loads of fun and still pretty decent for commuting - it won\\'t beat you up like a 350Z or Mustang.$24,271 including delivery via cars direct(Pasadena, CA). that is for a base model with the performance package - limited slip, foglights, and stability control. Other options? - maybe get a spoiler thrown in. The car is pretty well equipped as it is.  Plekto - those are hardly midsize sedans. Especially not the RX8 with it\\'s sardine can interior. The Subie is sweet, but small.What about a 2008 CTS with a 6 speed? Could be worth the wait, altho kinda pricey.  Resale value is just part of the car sales game, invented decades ago by GM. (Buy a GM and you\\'ll get top $ on a trade in.) That was before many people knew about how to buy a new car. The GM guy would give a top $ trade-in value against the MSRP (or near MSRP) of a new GM car. Trade-in a Ford, Chrysler or Rambler on a GM and they\\'d hose you on both ends of the deal. Peopel who plan on keeping a new car for 5 or more years shouldn\\'t be concerned with resale or trade-in value. In my state, CT, if a car is totaled the insurance company has to pay retail used car value. A couple months ago I looked at retail value of my \\'05 Sonata and it was only ~ $2,000 less than what I paid in April \\'05. I paid $4 or $5K less than a comparable camcord would have cost. Tell me where I\\'m taking a beating on depreciation.  A couple months ago I looked at retail value of my \\'05 Sonata and it was only ~ $2,000 less than what I paid in April \\'05. Yeah, too bad YOU can\\'t sell it for retail. :surprise:  The RX-8 is fine - really, even in most midsize sedans, is it really useable in the rear for more than two kids or small adults? A 2+2 car the size of an Infinity G35 is just fine, IMO.(and yes, it\\'s actually as large as a Mazda 6 or 350Z/G35). Midsize sport sedan with a silly amount of visual trickery and tweaking going on to make it look like a small coupe.The Subaru is a real driver\\'s car and will do just fine for family use. It\\'s about the same size as an old Volvo 240, which was considered a fine family car back in the day, size-wise.  You do realize that people pay $1,500 to more an $2K less than sticker for Toyotas and Hondas, as well as, finding deals on Hyundais. You may indeed pay less and if you feel the car is as good, then you have made a good deal. When talking dollar value, wait until the car actually sells to determine the difference from buy to sell. The retail value could become meaningless. Or surprise :surprise: you sell the car for a good sum. Let us know.Loren  guess youi must have owned that same Mazda 6 that one poster was claiming was worth more than he paid for it because silly Edmund\\'s said so?captain, I love how you selectively quote what others write so as to misrepresent what they really say... nice try. what I said was that I did an appraisal of my car on Kelly Blue Book and found that the retail value of my mazda6 after owning it for 18 months and having 20k miles on it, it was coming up that the suggested retail price was higher than what I paid for it. The bigger point I was making was that when buying certain cars that were/are being discounted heavily, this can help reduce the impact of depreciation if a buyer was concerned about buying a certain car because of bad resale value. There has been lots of talk in this thread that buying a camcord has the added advantage that resale values are higher thus the true cost to own calculations benefit camcords... but my experience shows that if a buyer is able to buy a car that is heavily discounted, this benefit can be flipped where the advantage is actually with the heavily discounted car, in this case, my mazda6 has an amazing resale value because I was able to buy it at a hugely reduced price. Since you don\\'t know what the advequitguy bought his Mazdaspeed6 for relative to MSRP, you can\\'t possibly have enough info to draw any useful conclusions.... and in the future captain2, I\\'d appreciate if you\\'d make an attempt to characterize what others have written accurately rather than twisting their words to make a point that they weren\\'t.  If its performance you want, I\\'d have to go with the altima. Gotta love that VQ. But, if your primary concern is price, you\\'d almost deffinitly get the 6 either for less, or same with more options.Have you driven the MS6? Trust me, the performance edge in this comparison clearly favors the MS6. A turbo 4-cylinder feeding AWD is my choice compared to a nose-heavy FWD. Don\\'t get me wrong, the VQ is indeed a great engine, but the handling of the Altima leaves a little to be desired compared to a regular Mazda6, and a LOT with the MS6. The previous-gen has terrible torque-steer, which gets a little unnerving in a corner. The \\'07 has toned down the TS, but it still floats more on the highway and rolls more than the 6 in the twisties.For a sedan with good performance, practicality and a broader appeal, the Altima is your choice. For a sedan that handles better than some sports cars, a powerful turbocharged engine with AWD, and still can seat 4 comfortably, pick the MS6.BTW, it isn\\'t difficult to get a MS6 Sport for $1500 less (or more) than the Altima...  what I said was that I did an appraisal of my car on Kelly Blue Book and found that the retail value of my mazda6 after owning it for 18 months and having 20k miles on it,other than KBB instead of Edmund\\'s, is there something wrong with the English language? The situation you claim, a car being worth more \\'retail\\' (according to anybody) after 18 months and 20k just plain doesn\\'t happen, and especially not to Mazda6s and even not to Camcords. Believe your KBB if you wish, they are wrong (as those numbers tend to be when any cars starts selling at big discounts) AND as indicated by that other poster that said that he had a great deal of difficulty getting any kind of reasonable value back on his Speed6.  In my world the backseat of a MiniCooper has more room than an RX8. I guess different strokes for different folks.  The MS6 is not in the same ballpark, size wise, as either the Forester or Legacy. It depends on what you are looking for in a vehicle. For a sedan that combines broad family practicality, with the best AWD system and great handling the Legacy turbo can\\'t be beat.  When you buy a used car you have to understand the market. There is a lot of room for negotiation on cars that are consistently heavily discounted or can easily be had for much less msrp or that take a huge depreciation hit the first year. KBB and ALG can help you understand the market, but it\\'s a crap shoot. Buying a car with the intent to sell it in three years based on what you believe to be the future asking price can lead to some surprises.  The Forester is a crossover, so obviously, it\\'s not in the same ball park as a sedan.The OP also never asked about the Legacy GT, only about the MS6 against the Altima 3.5SE. The LGT is indeed a great-handling sedan, but you\\'re right, it\\'s bigger size-wise than the MS6, and IMO it constantly reminds you of this when you\\'re driving as well.  it\\'s a crap shoot. Buying a car with the intent to sell it in three years based on what you believe to be the future asking price can lead to some surprises. all true, you have to wonder how these leasing cos. can project residual values (and therefore lease payment sizes) reliably when a particular car is just out. I just can\\'t imagine that even Mazda/FoMoCo) would have had any idea a few years back, that the 6, for example, would be having to be sold at $6k+ discounts and thus, the residual values would be in the dumper. Guess it must get to be a function of Mazda/Ford (if they are the lessor) \"taking it on the chin\" much in the same way that they do when they discount it that much to begin with? Buying any brand of vehicle with a \\'suspect\\' past in terms of future values is a helluva gamble but at least we do have a \\'red flag\\' - that being that that it is being sold for any number significantly below invoice.  1) I don\\'t want to sell the car. It\\'s been fantastic.2) Too bad practically no individual can sell their used car for retail, regardless of the make and model. :surprise:  Absolutely, but the Legacy doesn\\'t pretend to be a sporty car. It\\'s a sporty crossover. I was responding to the prior comment about the Subaru, not the OP comment.  Too bad practically no individual can sell their used car for retail, regardless of the make and model. Kbb has \"private party\" sale value, which is closer to what you can get for the car. Retail value is what you can expect at a dealership, and is usually $1k-$2k more. I think the \"condition\" of the car, and how \"in demand\" the car is in your area, has more to do with what you can sell a car for than any number on kbb.  Absolutely, but the Legacy doesn\\'t pretend to be a sporty car. It\\'s a sporty crossover. I was responding to the prior comment about the Subaru, not the OP comment.I think you might be confusing the Legacy with the Outback. I found the Legacy to be more sporting then the Honda, as sporting as the Altima, and less then the MS6 (although about on par with the comparable Mazda6). If you compare the Spec B with the MS6, things might be different but I haven\\'t driven a recent Spec B.  In my world the backseat of a MiniCooper has more room than an RX8. I guess different strokes for different folks. ****Actually, it\\'s about as large as the CTS or other midsize sedans if you ignore the wasted middle seat area. (which most people just use as an armrest by putting down the center console when sitting back there). The RX-8 just made that a full-time armrest/storage area. It\\'s not too bad to actually sit in.Plus, 95% of the time, people are driving alone or at most, with one kid in the rear. Even a Buick LaCrosse is miserable with three people in the rear. Needing a big car to commute in seems a bit of a waste to me. I\\'d rather get something sporty instead.  \"It\\'s not too bad to actually sit in.\"We talked about this. I don\\'t really care what the specs say, (imo) it\\'s absolutely claustrophic to sit in the back of an RX-8. Different strokes for different folks. One man\\'s palace is another man\\'s shack.  I drove the Legacy, it\\'s a very civilized vehicle with a bunch of creature comforts and the ability to pile stuff in the back and on the roof. With a turbo and 250hp it\\'s plenty fast as well.  As my dad owns a Legacy and I have significant experience with it, I think its an often overlooked gem in this segment. Great purchase prices, AWD confidence and enthusiastic handling, good reliability, fantastic interior design and materials, etc. Heck, the Legacy SE is equipped more or less the same as an Accord EX 4, but sells for less, plus you get AWD and better IIHS overall ratings. It just hasn\\'t fuel economy or room....which leads to my next point...I\\'m surprised at the talk about size, Legacy is much closer in interior volume to the Mazda 6 than it is to the Camry-Accord-Altima-Sonata crowd.  You are right, I mixed up my models. I was thinking of the LegBack model. :confuse To me Subaru has the most confusing model designations....don\\'t know why. Somehow 3,5,6,7 seems to work very well, while Legacy Spec B means nothing.  Not a Mazda6, but a real-world, private-party scenario.My 1998 Mazda 626 ES V6 had an original MSRP of $23,240 and an original invoice of $20,933. The car had the standard manual transmission, sunroof, leather, power seats, BOSE CD, ABS brakes, and alloy wheels.In June of 2001, with 50k miles, the original owner attempted to sell it for $12,500 but had no interest. He sold it at his reduced asking price of $10,500. This represents approximately 50% depreciation in 4 years.I drove the car 2 and 1/2 additional years and put another 45k miles on it, selling it in December 2003 for $5,700, or 30% of it\\'s original value. That figure was just below KBB \"excellent\" private party value at that time.  \"The MS6 is not in the same ballpark, size wise, as either the Forester or Legacy\"Not true. The Mazda6 is certainly bigger than the Forester and Legacy, but not by much.Cu ftLegacy 93Forester 95Mazda6 96Legacy wagon (outback) 97Mazda6 wagon 98For perspective the Civic is 91 and the Accord is 103.  I certainly think that a 20 year history and track record is about 20 times more reliable than a 1 year track record and history.When the Fusion\\'s been out as long as the Accord, then it will have legendary status similar to the Honda, but only if it can maintain the first year performance longterm!  I perceived the legacy [gt i sat in] to be notably smaller than the mazda 6. Im about 5-11, In the legacy I need to move the seat travel all the way back ... and then I can barely fit in the seat behind me... dont even ask about comfort. I dont understand how subaru can make such a small backseat ... dont they realize people come in much larger sizes than me? lol. Almost all of my friends are taller, some upto 6-5, putting them in an LGT would be worse than guantanamo bay lol.I can easily sit behind myself in a mazda6, comfortable for like 2~3hr car ride easily. After that it gets iffy even in any car in this segment.these are just my observations. If the legacy had a bigger back seat, it would be my #1 choice hands down [im lookin for manual transmission car]. Another problem with the legacy backseat is the C-pillar that forces you to contort your body to get in.  Forget the Legacy, the 6 is not bigger than the Forester in terms of usable area. You cannot a good part of the 96 cubic feet in the Mazda 6, while you can use a 100% of Foresters\\' 95 cubic feet.  whule I certainly agree with your historical perspectives, the Duratechs have been around for well over 10 yrs. if you also include the original 2.5s. Say what you want about the \\'competitiveness\\' of the current 3.0, but reliabilility and durability of it has gotten quite good. It\\'s when Ford decides to (or is able to) replace the engine with something truly new that I\\'m guessing those teething problems would logically appear. The 3.6 in the Saturn is a truly new engine that did fortunately spend some time under CTS hoods much like the Camry V6 had already spent some time under Avalon hoods (and others). As such, the jury must still be considered out on those particular engines especially relative to things like the current Honda V6, the \\'ancient\\' Nissan VQ, and yes, even that \\'ancient\\' DT.  The Mazda6 has more legroom for the backseat than the Forester.  per model year change press release; otherwise, minor changes at best for 2008 Mazda6sThis means the new 6 will arrive as a 09MY (perhaps 08.5MY but likely 09).  April-May 2008 arrival for the 2009 Mazda6 is the consensus opinion.  The Mazda6 wagon is a better comparison to the Forester and it has more space 98 vs 96 and also uses \"100%\" of the space.  Timing sounds about right for the US market. It will have its world debut staged at Frankfurt, and then either LA or Detroit as US debut.  MZ 6 Wagon may not be a better comparison; it and the MZSpeed 6 are cancelled for \\'08.  some new spy pics of the (2009?) new mazda6! I\\'m liking the interior but the outside looks a bit bloated...hard to tell though with all the cladding on it. one things for sure, I can\\'t wait til september to see it when it\\'s supposed to be unveiled at the Frankfurt Auto Show. here\\'s a link for some more pics and rumors about the new mazda6: link title  Forget the Legacy, the 6 is not bigger than the Forester in terms of usable area. You cannot a good part of the 96 cubic feet in the Mazda 6, while you can use a 100% of Foresters\\' 95 cubic feet.which is why it\\'s nice to have an option to buy a hatchback or wagon (until it is discontinued next year) in the midsize sedan class. those who want to be able to have the convenience and comfort of four doors yet have the flexibility to haul some pretty large things can buy a Mazda6 in it\\'s different styles so a buyer can get much more usefulness out of a midsize sedan. I posted this pic before, but I am still very happy with what I can fit in the back of my hatchback. for those who don\\'t recall, that\\'s 3 highback office chairs with arm rests in the back of my Mazda6 hatchback...  Hatchbacks are very useful, I had one myself. Some of the reasons I didn\\'t go with the Accord is I like to haul stuff, lots of stuff. There is a lot of very useable space and the cabin is wide open. There is room for 5 big adults without any issue whatsoever. I also wanted AWD, and wanted the turbo. There are tradeoffs the XT premium doesn\\'t have 5 gears and I like my windows framed. But the sunroof is awesome and the Forester has had a very good track record. That track record is reflected in the extended warranty which I bought which only cost a few hundred dollars extra.  other than KBB instead of Edmund\\'s, is there something wrong with the English language?apparently there is something wrong with the english language for you, cuz you can\\'t seem to quote or paraphrase people correctly...lolThe situation you claim, a car being worth more \\'retail\\' (according to anybody) after 18 months and 20k just plain doesn\\'t happen, and especially not to Mazda6s and even not to Camcords. Believe your KBB if you wish, they are wrong (as those numbers tend to be when any cars starts selling at big discounts) AND as indicated by that other poster that said that he had a great deal of difficulty getting any kind of reasonable value back on his Speed6.Did I ever say that I thought I could sell my car for the suggested retail amount that is listed in Kelly Blue Book. No, I didn\\'t. Once again, you are suggesting I said something that I never have. And if you were to read my original post, I listed the private party value for my Mazda6 which was $2200 off what I paid for it. Not bad for 18 months and 20k miles... but oh yeah, you don\\'t like to paraphrase what other people write correctly, so I\\'ll make it clear to everyone else. Here\\'s where I take issue with your disputing KBB\\'s valuations of cars. On the one hand you bring up the advantages of certain cars by mentioning Edmund\\'s True Cost of Ownership, which uses (among other things) used car values to determine the TCO. So in this situation you accept these used car values to draw conclusions about the cost of owning one of these cars. But in this instance, you are now saying that these used car valuations are junk and should be ignored... well captain2, you can\\'t have it both ways. And as a side note, when I got preapproved to get a loan for a used car, guess what the bank used to determine the maximum amount that they would loan me for a certain car... you guessed it, Kelly Blue Book. Regarding your mentioning that person with the Speed6 and his inability to get what he wanted from a dealer on trade in... First of all, when does a dealer ever give a fair trade in value at first... pretty much never. And how do you know how far into the negotiation he got? And how do you know how good of a negotiator he was anyway? Second, you have no idea what condition his car was in... was it damaged or abused? Third, you don\\'t know what the dealer offered him. Maybe that guy has the idea that he should get all of his money back and anything less is unreasonable... of course to expect this would be absurd, but how do you know if this guys expectations are realistic or not? Fourthly, how do you know what he paid for his car in the first place? If you don\\'t know that, how can you judge what \"reasonable value back\" is? And you have not tried to dispute the point in the three responses you\\'ve written to my first post that brought up the point that the more of a discount you get on a car, the less of a hit you will get when it comes to resale. Since you have not tried to dispute this, you must agree that you have no basis to judge whether the amount offered for his used car was realistic, fair, or reasonable.  Yeah, I love Subies... the car I owned prior to the Mazda6 was a 1996 Legacy GT wagon. I have some very fond memories of driving it in Southern Cal on hwy 1 along the windy roads overlooking the pacific coast... that was a ton of fun (except for all the stuff in the back that was sliding from side to side...a half gallon of water must have sloshed out of my cooler lol). Here in the NW there are tons of subies around and this demand kept me from getting the deal I wanted on a 05 legacy gt. Really an amazing car. A friend of mine just got an Outback (non turbo) and it\\'s really nice. As a side note, my legacy had 160k miles on it, and I sold it for 5.4k and it was advertized for less than a day.  Based on the latest spy shots of the Mazda6, it appears this car will be a real looker in the midsize segment, even in full camo the car looks great. With its larger portions i fully expect great things in the handling department also.   It\\'s kind of hard to tell with the cover-ups, but the lines of the new 6 remind me of the Altima.  I\\'m thinking the spyshots of the next generation Mazda6 shares a lot of the lines along with headlights and taillights, of the lexus IS... which by the way, I don\\'t think would be a bad thing.  My 1998 Mazda 626 ES V6 had an original MSRP of $23,240 and an original invoice of $20,933. The car had the standard manual transmission, sunroof, leather, power seats, BOSE CD, ABS brakes, and alloy wheels. In June of 2001, with 50k miles, the original owner attempted to sell it for $12,500 but had no interest. He sold it at his reduced asking price of $10,500. This represents approximately 50% depreciation in 4 years. What did he actually pay for it when new? If it were discounted like the Mazda6, perhaps he paid $5000 (or more)below MSRP, as a number of Mazda6 buyers have. That would mean he would have paid around $18,000 and depreciation was about 42%. This was also a manual, which makes selling it a lot more difficult.  aah so! OK I take it all back, and I\\'ll be right behind you (and FoMoCo) into the depths of Chapter 7 as we all make (lose?) a fortune buying and selling used (and new) Mazda6s! As I said it just doesn\\'t happen and nor is any car (yes, even those Camcords) ever a good investment from any reasonable strictly financial viewpoint. In terms of believing a Camcords probable resale value projections vs. anything else in this group (other than the Altima, which also ranks very high on the ole used desirability list) - all you really have to do is actually try to sell (or buy) one vs the other - and then you will see how close your treasured KBB retail/private party/tradein numbers really are - in both cases. Let me know when that happens to you, then I will apologize profusely for challenging any of these ridiculous contentions you make! As it is right now a Mazda6 should hold its value about as well as a Sonata - really lofty territory don\\'t you think? Things like $6k discounts on $20k new cars do things like that.  I like the interior shot! Looks at least better than the new Altima\\'s interior.Kinda makes me wonder if Nissan will have to do another \"Interior 2.0\" like they did with the 05 Altima. This time it wouldn\\'t be because of materials, it would be because of the spartan design.I like the new Altima, but the more I see new competitors hit the market, the more I worry that Nissan played it too safe with the Altima\\'s redesign. The front end (which looks like it\\'s smiling) isn\\'t nearly aggresive enough, the styling looks too similar to the previous generation.Even the Sonata is getting a more cohesive inteior next year...I\\'m definitely worried about Nissan.  once again, since you can\\'t seem to respond to what I\\'ve actually written and instead insist on making things up or divert into childish sarcism, I\\'ll just make the point that these are not my resale value #\\'s...they are KBB\\'s. If you have an issue with their valueations, feel free to show me some data that supports your point. Since banks, car dealerships, and magazines use KBB to figure things like TCO, this suggests that many people familiar with this industry feel that KBB is a good guide to car resale values. Until you can come up with more than your own personal hunch as to why KBB should be discredited, you\\'re just flailing around in this argument and not making any contact with the issues at hand. And since you\\'ve taken this position, you do realize that any effort you make to talk about TCO of cars has been invalidated by your own arguments... congrats.  OK, we are getting into sillyland again. This is NOT about individual resale values, and we have already done (to death) the resale value v. new argument. Please move on, so Pat & I don\\'t have to spend our Sundays deleting pedantic, nitpicky posts. Thank you.  Please move on, so Pat & I don\\'t have to spend our Sundays deleting pedantic, Yeah and we don\\'t have time to spend our Sundays looking up multiple syllable words like pedantic. :P j/k  Cool... then you\\'ll just take my word for it   Was/is a longer warranty a significant factor to anyone? When I shopped, it really wasn\\'t. I thought it would be nice to have a 4 or 5 year warranty, but in the end it really did not matter.I probably did give a little more consideration, than I otherwise would have to Sonata due to the warranty. Due to the warranty, I even gave very brief consideration to the Galant, but never did even test drive one...partly because the dealer is in an inconvenient location.Just wonder if anyone bought or is planning to buy model X instead of model Y specifically because of a long warranty. BTW, the only ones in this class that have 5 year full warranty are Sonata, Galant, and Optima, right?  didn\\'t even consider the warranty, have had nothing but good experiences with nissan. It took the finance guy 20 minutes and lowering the price twice to get me to take an extended warranty.  I think if someone was on the fence between this car, and that car, a longer warranty could make the difference. I doubt it would actually change one\\'s decision from the car of choice to another car. Maybe that\\'s why they don\\'t all have long warranties. Because it doesn\\'t change many minds.  I\\'m definitely worried about Nissan.Worried about what? Nissan\\'s ability to keep up with the strong demand for the new Altima?I think it\\'s a sweet ride. No worries.  That seems like a contradiction. You say \"don\\'t even consider the warranty\" and then said you spent 20 minutes dickering over the price of an extended warranty before you bought it.Sounds to me like you wanted a warranty that was better than what Nissan included as standard.Hyundai\\'s unmatched warranty was important to me. Four months before I bought my Sonata in April \\'05, I started researching cars. One of the things that attracted me to test drive a Sonata was the warranty. The more I researched, the more it became apparent that Hyundai was a \"player.\"My car has been fantastic. Not one thing has had to be adjusted or corrected in 27 months and ~15,300 miles. My brother now has an \\'07 Sonata, a friend has an \\'07 Azera (& 2 months after ownership bought his college age son an \\'02 Sonata w/ 15K miles) and he referred a co-worker who bought an \\'07 Tuscon.The warranty is meaningful to some people. I know that I won\\'t be looking at any major expenses for 5/60K and 10/100K for power train (the really major expenses) if something goes wrong. But, so far so good, on the 4 cars I mentioned.  Not one thing has had to be adjusted or corrected in 27 months and ~15,300 miles. Jeez - I hope not. I put 15,300 miles on a car in 9 months easy, and would expect zero issues in that time frame also, be it a Honda or a Ford.  I paid for an extended warranty once, back in 91. All that $600 got me was a new temperature control knob. If I think the car is unreliable, I don\\'t want. I bought a Nissan, a Toyota, and a Honda since then, and the only one that needed a repair (that would have fallen under extended warranty) was the Nissan. And that one didn\\'t amount to $600, so I came out ahead on that one too.  The Altima is in strong demand now...but there are some seriously new competitors that will be there.*New Malibu*New Mazda6 (that already is sportier than the Altima, and probably will be bigger and still probably handle better)*New Accord (that\\'s a given PERIOD)Nissan did a good job redesigning the Altima..but the styling is too evolutionary (I Love my 05, just wish the 07 was better) The interior has some good materials, but the design is lacking visually...Seems like Nissan is moving away from the \"BOLD\" designs of the previous generation. Things are too evolutionary now..and the Sentra has got to be the worst looking car to come out of Nissan since the current Maxima.  I like the style of the latest Altima. I prefer the transmission, and steering of my Accord. I do not like the strange placement of the emergency brake. Style wise, I would say pretty cool and modern. If buying a stick, I would consider one. Is the emergency brake still a foot one though, and placed about where the clutch should be?Loren  The warranty is meaningful to some people. I know that I won\\'t be looking at any major expenses for 5/60K and 10/100K for power train (the really major expenses) if something goes wrong.I was thinking about this because my 20 yr old kid totaled the hand-me-down Contour he was driving and will need to replace it. He seems to just want to buy another junker, which I think is the best choice for him. But I have been letting him know his other options. One of which would be buy a car with a 5 year warranty and pay for it over 5 years. The extra expense of interest and the need for collision insurance is partly offset by having no repair costs.I think for someone with a limited budget the 5 year warranty makes going with a 5 year loan safer. That is assuming they do not drive so many miles that the 5 years become 3 or something.  The Altima is in strong demand now...but there are some seriously new competitors that will be there. *New MalibuI doubt the new Malibu will have much of an impact on Altima sales. The Accord won\\'t either - there are built in sales Honda will always get, and for good reason. Shoot, even the Sonata hasn\\'t made much of a dent in the Accord\\'s armor, let alone the Altima\\'s.  That seems like a contradiction. You say \"don\\'t even consider the warranty\" and then said you spent 20 minutes dickering over the price of an extended warranty before you bought it. no, It\\'s not a contradiction. I went in to buy my car with no intention of purchasing a warranty. I\\'ve owned 2 other nissan vehicles, and never used the extended warranty. not even once. so this time, I figured why waste the money? However, the dealership had different plans. when they gave me the final price, I told them it was high, to drop the warranty. they spent 20 minutes trying to talk me into buying one. we weren\\'t dickering over price. they just kept lowering it because my intial reason for decling it was that it was a waste of money, which, for the most part, i thought it was. But for some reason, the dealership was hell bent on me getting an extended warranty. so, after 20 minutes of them twisting my arm, lowering the price of the warranty, and lowering other charges in order to get the car priced the same with the warranty as it would have been without it.............I gave in and took it.  Jeffyscott- I think you are very wise for considering insurance costs in that budget. Another thing to consider is how handy or willing to work on the car himself is he? Older vehicles have a \"nickel and dime\" tendency, but most of those things are reasonably easy to repair DIY. If the Accord (which is old) had to go in for service every time something broke, there is no way I could afford that car and the monthly maintenance cost would be more than a car payment (and perhaps the insurance cost would be offset by not having to spend time repairing it).At this point, unfortunately my time is becoming more valuable, keeping up with the vehicle repair is getting too much, and that monthly cost is approaching a car payment, so that is putting me in the market for something newer.  Another thing to consider is how handy or willing to work on the car himself is he?I think he is handy, but unwilling  . He does have a part-time job, though. He earns ~$150 per week and does not spend much, so he can afford the occassional repair. So the trade-off is $500-1000 per year in repairs vs. higher insurance costs and car payments. OTOH, if he has collision coverage he will limit his losses should he have another accident. OTOOH, if he has another accident insurance costs may explode...in fact, that may already be in the works, since it was officially a single vehicle accident. A least nothing was lost but a car, lucky considering he was forced off the freeway and then ended up spinning out of control accross all 3 lanes. I do wonder if ESC might have helped, though  ...  if he has another accident insurance costs may explode...in fact, that may already be in the works, since it was officially a single vehicle accident.You can count on it. Anyone know if mid-size sedans cost less to insure?  I do wonder if ESC might have helped, though Yup, it would\\'ve kept him going head first straight into the k-barrier :P (I\\'m just kidding, although that is a reasonable possibility)It sounds like his experience is typical of where the vehicle off road crashes happen. When the car leaves the roadway and tries to get back on, a bunch of bad stuff starts happening. This is also one of the easiest ways to roll an SUV, as joining the roadway from a low shoulder may be enough to provide the \"trip\" to roll it. Its very scary stuff. One of the things they told us at the HPDEs is \"if you go off, stay off,\" which was basically saying if you exist the course (or roadway or whatever) to get the vehicle completely under control (and slowed) before rejoining the roadway; there have been a number of times I have seen a vehicle go spinning off on the inside of a course (with an open field and no obstacles) only to fight its way back onto the course while the driver didn\\'t have enough directional control of the vehicle and would hit the inside wall sideways.  That may be so.The new Malibu has all of the goodness of the Aura, plus more, I wouldn\\'t doubt the Malibu too much, considering the Impala outsells the Altima.If the Impala, with all of it\\'s old technology, can beat the Altima, who\\'s to say a new Malibu couldn\\'t?Same with the Accord. The Impala is getting close to Accord sales, probably do to fleets. But the Altima is sold in high numbers to fleets as well.  Yes, he probably should have just stayed off on the right shoulder, taken his foot off the gas and let the car slow down. I will mention that to him for future reference. Thanks for pointing this out, it\\'s what I think I have done in somewhat similar situations but had not thought of it.I am not sure exactly what he did do, I don\\'t think he is either.  Anyone know if mid-size sedans cost less to insure? It does seem to. Allstate has a \"ballpark estimate\" feature on Focus was about 10% more than Fusion. With liability only the difference was about 20%. That is odd, you would think liability would be less, the smaller the car is. They do include uninsured motorist in that estimate, but I can\\'t imagine that costs enough to account for the difference.  One of which would be buy a car with a 5 year warranty and pay for it over 5 years. The extra expense of interest and the need for collision insurance is partly offset by having no repair costs. The truth, though, is that you can get a \"beater\" that\\'s a perfectly fine car for less than $6000 that\\'s only a few years old. Of course, it will be a Ford or GM midsize sedan, but they are safe and get reasonably well mileage as well.Say he gets a $9995 Chevy Aveo(5 year drivetrain) - about as cheap as it gets new. It\\'s going to kill him in payments and not be either as safe or as nice as say, an 7-8 year old LeSabre or a 5-6 year old Grand Marquis.Grand Marquis GS($6,000)Manufacturer Rebates:Net Cost: $17,879That\\'s new. Used:http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?car_id=221055456Yes, 6.5 years old and $5995. New makes no sense at all for someone on such a limited budget. I boubt if he\\'s going to abuse it even half as bad a a taxi driver or police officer.Fuel cost is minimal as well, so mpg is moot. - what he needs at 20 years old is sometihng to get to school and work. He\\'s not putting on 20,000 miles a year(at least I hope he\\'s not - lol)Actually, I\\'d go OLD. Classic and dirt cheap to work on. Pre-smog, and pre-computers. Like an old Volvo 140. Engine is bulletproof, rest of the car can be worked on for almost nothing. Get one of the 1976 or older models as there isn\\'t any computers or smog equipment to really speak of. It\\'s virtually the same as a Volvo 240, just with carbs and stuff you can fix yourself.Or you can always find an older 1970s domestic. Something that loks retro and he can fix and modify a bit - without losing too much value. There\\'s a reason college students tend to drive old heaps like this. Because there isn\\'t anything that gets you areound for less money.  Those new found sales for the Impala are mostly rental fleet. 53.9% for the first half of 2007 were fleet sales of one sort or another. The Honda Accord was 4.9%, so there you have it, you decide. Altima 16.4% fleet - big deal ! The Impala found some new retail customers when it change the look inside and out. The freshen up was a good one. More advertising and a longer warranty also helped. It however is no match for the foreign competition. The car is what it is. A bit larger, good for a company car or renting for a vacation.The New Malibu is going to do better than the Aura, no doubt. It has all the Chevy dealerships and a more interesting looking interior, with possibly better pricing off-the-bat. So Malibu does well, Aura is just sort of hanging around and the G6 is due to die off.Loren  As I said, if the Impala (regardless of fleet sales) can be sold in great numbers, who\\'s to say a Malibu which is significantly better than the Impala, and better than the Aura can\\'t do the same thing? Each year those fleets sales have went down for the Impala, so it\\'s a sign that retail sales for the Impala are actually improving.I never mentioned anything about the Accord\\'s fleet sales, which I knew would be low. But I do believe that the new Malibu will be a true competitor, more so of a competitor than the Fusion, Aura or Sonata mainly because of Chevy\\'s big dealer network and the fact that the car is soooo much better than the current model. I also feel that the Malibu\\'s styling is going to attract some people to and that it\\'s interior (with it\\'s elements of cheapness) is unique because it offers so many color schemes. Some features of the Malibu are missing (Nav, Bluetooth, etc) but I feel the car is going to be competitive otherwise, just like the Aura is...but it will be a MUCH better seller than the Aura because it has a bigger network of dealers, a competitive V6, I4/6spd auto combo on the LTZ, and more competitive pricing than the Aura has.We\\'ll have to wait it out and see...but in the meantime, as an owner of the previous generation Altima, I\\'m still worried about the car.Has anyone seen this pic of the new \\'Bu? I\\'m feeling it.Either way I can\\'t wait until all these new cars get here! A new Accord in Sept, around the same time we get to see the new Mazda6 in Geneva. By Jan, the new Malibu will be here.Can\\'t wait to see some comparison tests.  Nope, fleet sales are rising for the Impala  Say he gets a $9995 Chevy Aveo(5 year drivetrain) - about as cheap as it gets new. It\\'s going to kill him in payments... After estimating the insurance cost, that alone kills him. So another beater it is...maybe it\\'ll be a midsize  .  You can count on it. Anyone know if mid-size sedans cost less to insure?My insurance went up $48 per year when I traded my Mazda6 S in for the Mustang GT. Howver, I\\'m not 20 years old like jeffyscott\\'s son either.   The New Malibu is the most promising of all the cars built off that chassis. What GM needs though is more NEW - UNIQUE cars again. Move ahead of the bunch of other stuff in the market place and get that old we are Body by Fisher top notch in style thing going again. I am thinking a good platform for this is the Aussie cars coming to Pontiac, then Chevy. The New Malibu is a good enough entry, but a bit like an \" oh yeah, we can do that too \" car. The Aura XE was a mistake, they all should have been the upscale XR and price at $21,999 in the beginning.Malibu should be the price leader with the i4, then have the 3.6 V6 for say that $21,999 price tag, at the very most.Loren  I thought it would be interesting to post a video of my Accord accelerating from 5 to 80 MPH. This way everyone can hear what it sounds like when it sings its song, sort of share in the experience. We\\'ve certainly done enough talking about acceleration, engine noise, etc... now watch the video.This was filmed at a rest stop. I started rolling at 5 MPH in the truck lane which merges with the car lane that becomes the onramp. You can see a white Expedition pass by in the car lane a few seconds before I begin my run. Before even reaching the end of the ramp, I\\'ve caught the Expedition and have to merge all the way over into the fast lane on the freeway, coming up on a car which is going 80 MPH. There was plenty of lane left. It certainly was fun.LINK TO VIDEO ON CARSPACEThe car feels much faster than the spec sheet suggests. For all the people who say you need a V6 to make merging/passing \"safe\" or that 4-cylinders can\\'t perform, you\\'ve got to try a Honda!Anybody else want to post a video of what their car sounds like at full throttle? Mazda6, Altima, Aura... what is the merging experience like?  There are two V6s available in the Aura. One is a new design, I believe, and one is an older engine. Which is which?  Just wonder if anyone bought or is planning to buy model X instead of model Y specifically because of a long warranty.No. I can\\'t drive a warranty.  But if multiple cars met my needs in every other respect, then I\\'d use factors like warranty along with price, dealer convenience etc. to make the final choice. Besides, one can always buy an extended warranty if it\\'s important. So in a way the warranty question becomes a price question.Besides the Galant, Optima, and Sonata with long warranties, the Verona has a 7-year, 100k transferrable powertrain warranty. And the Elantra (and I think the Spectra also?) has mid-sized room and the long warranty also.  Easy to remember: the cheapest Aura model has the older design engine.  ...http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070624/BUSINESS01/706240593/10- 14  Sales IN TOTAL up 41% and the RETAIL sales are up 27%, so the rest is made up of additional sales to fleet. Trust me, 53.9% or almost 54% going to fleet explains a good portion of the increase and how the overall sales numbers look good when compared to other cars. That is way high, not a good portion for fleet. They gotta do what they gotta do, but I hope the resale values maintain or go up so they do not effect the RWD Aussie Impala when it is up for sale.Loren  XE has the 3.5 OHV and a four speed transmission.XR has the 3.6 DOHC and a six speed transmission. Aluminum alloy 18\" wheels, stability control, and let\\'s just say at the end of the day, a better buy than is the XE with the plastic hub caps and cheaper wheels, and old tranny and well, just plain cheaper version of the XR. The XE is not bad, it just is not a great deal. The XR, if found for that $1,750 off discount and if they give you a good trade-in, is not so bad a deal when compared to all the competition. Every car has one or two things better or worse than the next when you start doing all the research and test drives. As a whole the Aura is good - the Accord is good IMHO. The Fusion / Milan is pretty good. Your values may vary.I would expect resale on the Aura to be lower than an Accord. And while they thought the hot seller to be the XE, more people seem to like the XR than GM had planned. Considering the components in total and performance as a whole, the XR beats out the XE. Not sure why they have this car, since a less expensive New Malibu with an i4 is on the way.Loren  I\\'m definitely worried about NissanNissan has purportedly the PROFITABLE car lines of all the manufactuerers (they do a real good job with platform/drivetrain sharing), the Altima is a solid no. 3 in this class in terms of sales (almost matching the Accord), and also rates very very well in terms of residual values, besting the Accord. And they have perhaps the guy running the outfit available. CR has the Altima as its top rated midsize (tied with the Accord) What\\'s to worry?While I\\'ll agree that earlier Altimas did not have interiors up to the same quality as Camcords, the new model is much much better. I believe they may have some difficulty however with public acceptance of the fuel efficient CVT - it should either be a big hit or a big flop.  I find it puzzling to be \" definitely worried about Nissan\" based on the new Altima. Although I can\\'t think of a truly scientific way to judge the success or appeal of a vehicle based on knowledge that is available in the public arena, here\\'s my best attempt:-CYTD sales of the Altima are up 18.4%-Fleet sales (most recent available, 6 mo. 09/06 - 02/07) of the NEW Altima are 16.5%-According to the July 9 Auto News, Factory to Dealer and Factory to Consumer incentives were minimal, and much lower than those for the &#146;06 Altima at this time last yearSo, even assuming that every single one of the 2006 went to a consumer and not fleet (obviously not the case), sales are STILL up vs. the \\'06, and consumers are paying HIGHER prices. Now consider:-CYTD through June, Accord sales are up-CYID through June, Camry sales are upThis shows that while these models still dominate, it&#146;s not like &#150; in particular re: the Accord &#150; this is a momentary spike in Altima sales due to the lack of appeal from other models. If anything, the fact that the Altima can grow share while the Honda piles on factory to dealer Accord incentives to move inventory, is a sign of strength, in my opinion.Finally:- Consumer Reports recently put the Altima (4 and V6) at or near the top of their class. While *I know* that everyone on this board is a far better consumer (so spare me the flaming) and considers a million and one things before purchase, other, less enthusiast-like consumers will see that report, and that&#146;s all they need to know.- The Altima has introduced a coupe for 2008, broadening the appeal to consumers by offering more model variations- The Altima now offers a hybrid, vs. last generation- For those who care about safety, ABS is now standard, which I think was one of the most detrimental aspects of the more basic Altimas.So, based on all of this, where does the \"worry\" come from? Certainly while I&#146;m not against the continual improving of product, I simply think that the new Altima, to date, is quite successful, and shrewdly positioned for the future &#150; including the new Accord, Malibu, 6, et al.[If any model launch should give Nissan pause, it&#146;s the Sentra, and potentially the Versa&#146;s role in that dramatic sales plummet]  less enthusiast-like consumers will see that report, and that&#146;s all they need to know. right on the mark here - CR likely the single most influential opinion on any car - whether it deserves to be, or whether we \\'enthusiasts\\' happen to agree with their particular priorities is not the point, it remains a Bible of sorts for many. The strange part of this - CR was not all that excited about the new Camry except for the Hybrid (of course) but it hasn\\'t seemed to hurt sales - the majority of which are 4 banger LEs.  I don\\'t see this as strange at all. Toyota produces a reliable sedan that appeals to the masses, they understand their target market very well. I applaud them for that.  Jeez - I hope not. I put 15,300 miles on a car in 9 months easy, and would expect zero issues in that time frame also, be it a Honda or a Ford. Unfortunately, I\\'ve owned a Chrysler conceived Dodge vehicle built in 1994 (95 model) and it required serveral visits in the first 15,000 miles for warranty issues.I\\'d expect zero to one issues as well, but we can\\'t always get what we expect (unless your buying Toyota\\'s and Honda\\'s  )  kd- the question was why - if CRs opinion means so much to the \\'average Joe\\' carbuyer - are more buyers not looking past the Camry? Half a million Camrys is a bunch of cars even relative to Honda and Nissan volumes, never mind all the \\'also rans\\'. Not denying Camry\\'s well justified reputation and/or the position it has developed in the midsize sedan market at all.  FWIW, the Camry still finishes VERY highly in CR\\'s rating scheme. It\\'s just that the Altima is at the TOP.  And we all know that absolutely nothing has changed in the american automotive industry since 1994. :confuse:  As does, of course, the Accord, despite being 4 years young. But it does seem that the American carbuyer seems to value that Toyota trademark smooth/quiet/soft ride more than what CR does.  \"And we all know that absolutely nothing has changed in the american automotive industry since 1994. :confuse: \"Yeah, in 2004 it was my Ford...  If the Ford Fusion -- or any other mid-size sedan for that matter -- received the highest awards for all categories from all testers and went from 0-60 in 6 seconds flat, delivered 40 mpg in city driving, etc., etc. it still wouldn\\'t create much of a dent in Toyota Camry and Honda Accord sales, IMHO.Why? Because Camry and Accord have such a fine track record that they get an enormous amount of repeat business from satisfied owners.At this point, FoMoCo, GM, Chrysler would have to build the best mid-size sedan for 10 years running before pulling even with the Camry and Accord. Their lead is almost insurmountable. Of course, Toyota and Honda know this and continue to improve their products as well.I believe our 2007 SEL AWD Fusion is every bit as good as a Camry or Accord (better in some respects) but obviously the car-buying public sees things differently.  Well, if you call declining sales volume a change, then yes, the American Automotive industry has changed since 1994. Far less market share. :P  If the Ford Fusion -- or any other mid-size sedan for that matter -- received the highest awards for all categories from all testers and went from 0-60 in 6 seconds flat, delivered 40 mpg in city driving, etc., etc. it still wouldn\\'t create much of a dent in Toyota Camry and Honda Accord sales, IMHO. However, it would make a dent, or more than a dent, more like a 360, if they backed the new \"improved and better car\" with a superb warranty, but not only that, a graduated penalty payment plan for when your car does (if it does) break down. See..... people buy Camry\\'s and Accord\\'s because they know they won\\'t break down. Reliability is one of the main selling points of the Camcords. If you put in a warranty for 10 years and 100K, plus you say we\\'ll pay you if you need to use it, and even more if you have to use it a lot, then you\\'ll steal sales away from Toyota and Honda immediately.In fact, you\\'ll take an insurmountable lead against their seemingly insurmountable lead. Of course, this requires you to put out a better car, at the same or less cost, will all the warranty and penalty payment plan perks.  Actually, the Passat tops CR\\'s family car ratings for 4 cylinder cars and the Accord, Passat, and Altima are tied for 1st for V6s. Interestingly, for the 4s the Camry Hybrid, at $30,667 the most expensive 4 cylinder car on CR\\'s list, is ranked 3rd, but the Optima tied the non-hybrid Camry. And on both lists, the five-year-old Accord topped the non-hybrid Camry. So it\\'ll be interesting to see how the new Accord rates.  No, people buy Camcords because they have a history of satisfied ownership which includes much better than average reliability. Boz is right - a satisfied Camcord owner isn\\'t likely to look elsewhere unless they have a bad experience. It will take years, maybe decades to win over any significant percentage of those buyers unless the Camcords continue to have problems like the engine sludge and transmission problems or the styling, features or pricing get way out of line.Ford\\'s best hope is to continue to keep quality high and to continue to make improvements every 3-4 years so that a Fusion owner looking for something new has a new model to consider. If the 2010 model looks just like the 2006 model then current customers will look elsewhere for something new. This is where the Camcords have succeeded the last 20 years. And that\\'s why the 2009 Fusion refresh is so critical.  The answer is simple, most buyers use CR as reference rather than gospel. At least it\\'s that way for me. You also can never really assume you know how the average \"JOE\" thinks. If the \"Average Joe\" thought CR was gospel, than sales in this category would be relative to CRs ranking, which we know it\\'s not.  Passat tops the rankings for 4 cylinders by one point, indeed, but IMO is out of contention because of its abysmal reliability rating (reference the black dot). Pending a strong showing by the Altima (and it has never in its history fallen below \\'Average\\' by CR), it will be the highest rated 4 cyl. recommended model..... until the likes of the new Accord, Malibu, et al. are tested. And even if the Altima V6 is TIED at the top (which it is), it is still at the TOP....FWIW, the Camry Hybrid is now also available for $25,800, if you can forgo alloys, JBL/6CD, electrochromatic rearview, and the leather, moonroof, and NAV options of the CR test vehicle.  This is where the Camcords have succeeded the last 20 years. And that\\'s why the 2009 Fusion refresh is so critical.I couldn\\'t agree more Allen. The Fusion is a terrific mid-size car but it must continue to be just that in order for Ford to make any headway in this market segment.Even if someone other than Toyota or Honda could build the \"perfect\" car it would probably require a decade or more to overcome the lead now held by Camry and Accord.It took years for the Toyota engine sludge problem to surface and even longer for it to be resolved. To be sure, those owners who suffered through this ordeal would never buy another Toyota product. Toyota\\'s reluctance to acknowledge the problem is one reason why I would not buy one of this company\\'s cars.  Weird how the 4-cylinder Passat has an \"abysmal\" reliability score from CR but the V6 is fine and is Recommended by CR.I have a feeling CR will test and report on the new Accord ASAP, since it is so popular, maybe the Malibu also. So the Altima\\'s position as \"top-ranked Recommended 4 cylinder family car\" could be very short.Nearly all (or maybe all?) of the family cars CR tested are available for less than the tested price--almost all for thousands less than the Camry Hybrid\\'s starting price. But an Altima costing $8000 less than the Camry Hybrid out-pointed it. In the V6 group, the Accord was over $4000 less than each of the other two top-ranked cars.  Well I had heard of VW\\'s with oil consumption problems, so before considering a Rabbit or Jetta, I thought to ask the salesman what they considered oil consumption under warranty issues. He referred me to the service dept, which confirmed what I had heard that the 8/10 qt. per 1,ooo miles is the limit acceptable. And you break in a VW engine, as in a rather slow break in period, as in these must be old technology engines, IMHO. Too each his own, but I am not interested in these four banger or now five banger engines if they may start consuming oil. Now it is very well possible that broken in correctly, few if any will consume oil. Anyone out there which owned several of these VW\\'s over the years care to chime in? I am going by what you hear off the chat rooms, complaints issued listed on the Net, and just what the warranty considers as excessive. Japan engines use less than a quarter per 5,ooo miles. Not 8/10 qt. every 1,ooo miles.Loren  I\\'d expect zero to one issues as well, but we can\\'t always get what we expect (unless your buying Toyota\\'s and Honda\\'s ) Eh, not true for me. Before my first tank of gas was gone, I had to have my rear-view mirror (the interior one) replaced in my brand new Accord because the mirror glass wasn\\'t attached to the plastic housing properly (causing a very bad vibration in the mirror). Also, the gas flap fit so tightly, it wouldn\\'t always open on the first push of the lever when it was new, and required adjustment. All within 1,000 miles. Brand new Honda. Two (very minor) issues. Honda and Toyota are businesses, not heavenly bodies.By the way, I absolutely love my 2006 Accord 4 cylinder. I\\'ve got 22,800 miles on it now.   In the V6 group, the Accord was over $4000 less than each of the other two top-ranked cars. It\\'s reassuring to know the car I bought 4 years ago, is still at the top of the heap. I\\'m so proud.  What are the chances my next car will be an Accord also? Pretty high, so far.  Those minor issues you had at purchase with your Accord are caused by the Ohioans..... I\\'m assuming. Was your Accord assembled in Ohio, I\\'d bet 3 to 1 it was; judging from the assembly issues you describe. But even the Ohioans can\\'t screw up superior engineering and parts quality all that much; so the major issues are still rare.  VW also noted for sludging issues as well as consumption, and it should be noted that Nissan also had an oil consumption issue (on its 4 banger) that led to a recall, something I believe Nissan handled properly. The VW V6 is every bit as high tech and almost as efficient as the Toyota 2GR IMO, don\\'t have any idea why the \\'old fashioned\\' break-in period requirements or FTM why the 4 banger should be showing a poor track record unless, of course, its related to the turbocharged versions. The Passat V6 is one sweet driving car (great power/reasonable FE) combined with some \\'tight\\' handling - high relative price and lower relative resale seem to hurt it. Perhaps it should be included in this group.  Those minor issues you had at purchase with your Accord are caused by the Ohioans..... I\\'m assuming. Was your Accord assembled in Ohio, I\\'d bet 3 to 1 it was; judging from the assembly issues you describe. Those same Ohioans assembled my 03, and it has \"NO\" issues in 4 years and 47k miles. So give the Ohioans credit for this one too.  that\\'s been my point backy...Altima is highly rated now but with a new Accord and more competition I worry.  WRONG...sales overall are UP 27 PERCENT..Retails sales are UP 41 PERCENT.High fleet sales or not, the article still makes the point clear..and makes mine clear too. If the Impala can OUTSELL the Altima (regardless of how high it\\'s fleet sales and rerbates are) what makes one think an Improved Malibu that is much better than the Impala, offers the high volume I4 engine and has a bigger dealer network than Nissan, can\\'t fundalmentally catch up with the Altima?Go back and re-read the article. :P \"Sales of the midsize sedan were up 27% to 144,541 in the first five months of the year, compared with 114,014 a year ago. And while the roomy sedan long has been a staple of commercial, government and rental fleets -- analysts say fleet sales generate about half its sales -- GM said retail sales have provided the largest bump this year, with a 41% increase in year-over-year sales\"More sales go to fleet overall, but those sales are going down as sales retail sales overall increase.  No need to worry. The Altima won\\'t get worse because other cars get better. More competition will force Nissan to make continuous improvements on the Altima, e.g. for 2008 ABS is becoming standard. And maybe more competition will result in a bit lower prices for the Altima.   > I am going by what you hear off the chat rooms, complaints issued listed on the Net, You know you can\\'t go by what\\'s on the discussion groups. People here say the problems get overemphasized by a few disgruntled posters.  Actually, my Ohio built \\'06 was much less problematic than my dad\\'s Japanese-built Accord (that car had to have the whole headliner replaced to get to an awful rattle).My Ohio-made 1996 Accord has less rattles NOW (174k mi) than his Japanese made Accord was.  I think you hit the nail on the head with this comment: \"(insert your manufacturer) reluctance to acknowledge the problem is one reason why I would not buy one of this company\\'s cars\".I can\\'t speak for anyone else, but I wholeheartedly agree. This is why two of the manufacturers who manufacture cars in this segment are off my list. Not Toyota and not Honda. I would think when you have a bad experience with a manufacturer you might shy away. Toyota IMO has more satisfied customers than any other manufacturer in this segment, even with the sludge problem. Satisified customers, lead to repeat sales.  OK, I may indeed have gotten the figures backwards. I stand corrected.Here are the figures for the first half of this year to compare to Impala:RETAIL SALES:Impala 68,565 Accord 155,556Camry 177,431Altima 106,705In this period they sold 80,134 Impalas to fleet. While it is very good that sale to retail is up, due to more aggressive advertising, a make over of the look and new interior, as well as perhaps some sweet deals at the dealerships, the car is not as big a retail player as the rest of its smaller playmates in the field. Impala retail sales will be strong if the new RWD is introduced, and they get everything right at launch time.Loren  If, or when the New Malibu should outsell the Altima, then what? Actually, it doesn\\'t matter how many GM sell, if it is not for a profit. Seems to me that they are still competing against themselves when offering the G6, then the Aura, and now the New Malibu. I take it the G6 ends once the Pontiac go all RWD drive series. Isn\\'t the Saab 9-3 another car based on this platform of the G6, or visa-versa? Anyway, a lot of cars the same width, which makes the interior a skosh smaller than say the Accord or Camry. I don\\'t care for those darn floor pedal emergency brakes. And support rods for engine hoods are old hat. All in all, the new series is good though, with so far the Aura XR being the value leader when discounted some $1,500 or $1750 during sales. The New Malibu should successfully kill off the Aura XE, and G6 sedans; not sure about the Aura XR.The New Malibu should be a good car. Now they need to build an awesome car which looks like an American icon quality again. The shape of the Malibu will be pleasing. Lots of that on the road however from every make in the World. Heck the Koreans have some pleasing looking cars. Loren  Aura, Malibu, G6 (Saab 93). A prime example of spreading yourself too thin. All these different designs, different ad campaigns, and different dealer networks for ONE segment. Not smart, IMO.  I don\\'t know. None of them seem to be faring badly because of platform sharing. If they are faring badly, it would be for other reason (el-cheapo interior in the current Malibu, for one).  I think if GM concentrated all these separate efforts into making 1 midsize sedan, they could end up with a better car. Sure, they are selling a lot of cars if you add them all up, but they are also spending a lot to make and sell all of them separately.  I get your point on the Aura, Malibu and G6, but the Saab 9-3 is in different segment from those other three.Thankfully within the next few years, GM will make the G6 rear wheel drive, which will essentially leave the Aura and Malibu as the main bread and better sedans. That way Aura=Euro sportyMalibu=Mainstream  Agreeing with you on that point. So many sedans could be the very reason we don\\'t see bluetooth, navigation and other options on the current (and future) crop of GM\\'s midsize sedans. GM is making progress though and I expect the company will do a \"Nissan\" in a few years.  Then how would GM pay all of its Auto workers? I saw on the evening news that on average, the Big Three pay $72 an hour to employees in salary, healthcare, and benefits.The Japanese three (Toyota, Honda, Nissan) pay $48 in America, by comparison. That means Detroiters are paying time and a half compared to the Japanese, but aren\\'t getting any extra effort for their money.Sorry for the sidebar, but I thought those numbers were very interesting.  Then how would GM pay all of its Auto workers? I saw on the evening news that on average, the Big Three pay $72 an hour to employees in salary, healthcare, and benefits. That\\'s part of what I\\'m saying. GM is paying $72 an hour to build 3 (at least) different cars that compete against each other for the same buyer. Honda pays to design 1 car, build 1 car, and sell 1 car for this segment. Sounds like the most efficient way to do it.  $72 vs. $48. That\\'s bad decisions from the past still haunting GM today. Do they have to keep making them?  My take on this:Aura should have been the same as the Opel, sold as such by Saturn, while building the cars here and overseas. There is no real Saturn, as in those funny little plastic cars (no ding doors-neat idea), which were very unique. Those are gone and the new cars are all metal, and versions of other cars.Malibu should have been RWD if the new Impala is going RWD and a tad wider inside, sold in three versions, a base i4 for price, a V6 with goodies, and a sport version for enthusiasts. The car should be in a coupe and sedan version, selling from $18,500 to $25,500 range with sport package and goodies. IF the New Malibu is FWD, why then the RWD Impala? Considering the lower end, and it being smaller, perhaps the Malibu is really more of a Nova -- just a thought.G6 could be dropped. The Pontiac goes Aussie cars in RWD.Saab may always have a following, but those are small numbers, unless they tax the engine displacement in USA. Where is the room mate for Saabs? Is it Cadillac, Ponitac or Saturn? Someone, please adopt this pet.CTS should have a coupe model.Loren  Hey folks, do you have dealerships you\\'d like to review, good or bad? You can review a sales experience with them and/or a service experience. Check it out here: Dealer Rater.  I don\\'t see Chevy making the Malibu RWD anytime soon. That would be foolish considering the Malibu is a volume seller (fleets and othewise) Chevy has the highest brand recognition and the biggest dealer network.Chevy is GM\\'s largest brand and GM as a company needs to keep at least one fully mainstream sedan to compete head to head with the likes of the Accord and Camry. Making the Malibu RWD would be a bad idea. That would leave the Aura as the only real FWD midsize offered and Aura sales are disappointing at best. Also, you have to remember that a LOT of folks don\\'t want RWD. Further, from what I\\'ve been reading about the RWD, 2009 (or is it 2010?) Camaro, GM is having a tough time bringing the platform cost down so that a base Camaro V6 can be offered for $25K. That same platform would not be available for a RWD Malibu for about $18.5K. What other RWD platform could they use and remain cost efficient? Offering a RWD Full Size Impala and a FWD Midsize Malibu is probably GM\\'s best bet that way you take care of the biggest market of sedans (FWD Midsize Sedans) which Chevy has GOT to be in to be succesful and the growing, revitalized RWD full size market (300, Charger, soon Aussie Fords)From what I\\'ve read, the G6 isn\\'t going anywhere as far as it\\'s name is concerned. Pontiac is doing the whole \"alphanumeric\" thing so even if the next Midsize Sedan were to go RWD (outside of the new G8) the name will still end up being G6 b/c they can\\'t call it a G5 or G4. G6 name is likely to remain. I\\'d propose the following:Malibu=FWD, offered with I4/6spd combo throughout (Not just LTZ models) and V6/6spd combo as it will be. Malibu should compete completely head to head with the Accord and Camry offering similar options, similar power.Aura=FWD, should compete more along the lines with the Mazda6, Nissan Altima, Suby Legacy. Maybe offer AWD on it (if that\\'s possible) Aura should be the sportier alternative to the Malibu, with Euro handling and a more euro looks (from spy shots of the next Vectra, we may get an Aura like this)G6=Competely RWD, a poor man\\'s BMW.That way no one is stepping on anybody\\'s toes. My question is what happens to the LaCrosse after the Impala get\\'s redesign because aren\\'t they on the same platform?  Edmunds just completely one.http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/Comparos/articleId=121755Seems like the main things keeping the Altima from being the winner are slightly lower fuel comsumption, lack of availability and high pricing. The Aura Hybrid is pitiful...hope GM can hurry up and get the dual-mode system in it.I wonder if Altima sales would be any higher if the Hybrid were more available in other states, especially down in the cities of the SE (Atlanta, Charlotte) and Midwest (Chicago, St. Louis) etc?  That\\'s bad decisions from the past still haunting GM today. Do they have to keep making them?That\\'s the part of Ford\\'s plan that people seem to forget. Ford now has 29,000 fewer workers than it had 12-18 months ago BUT these workers left with a one time buyout and thus they are not eligible for any future pension or health care benefits. Ford has $0 future obligation. That will save the company at least $3B next year in expenses and that\\'s not counting any of the plant shutdowns. And this didn\\'t cause any sales reductions - this was excess capacity that wasn\\'t being used anyway.  I think that Dealer Rater needs some work. I punched in my zip code and preferred make and it listed dealers that were way out of my comfortable range and the one that is actually close to me is now closed and the building has been sold to WalMart. There are 3 dealers for the make I chose that are a lot closer to my house and they weren\\'t on the list. I never heard of a couple of the dealers the system listed actually. :surprise:  I think you will hear from the Help Desk on this, but for any others who might run into these kinds of things, here\\'s how to report it. Go to the Help link at the bottom of the page and then to the Contact Us tab at the top. You can give all the details there and it will be reported to the people who can straighten it out.There is no category for DRR (yet, maybe it\\'s coming), so be sure to specify DRR, or Dealer Rater or something in the body of your report to be clear where the issue is.  In San Diego there is a Cadillac/Saab/Hummer Dealer....  Well then, make the Impala FWD. Pontiac could then be the all RWD and Performance division. Personally, I think while the New Malibu may do well in the market, they are wasting so much time, money and energy taking on Honda and Toyota say, one on one. Just make a cool looking car like the CTS for the masses. People buy for various reasons, but the style is important, if you are not going to extremes to outdo the competition on the track. If they really make those Holden Pontiac imports drop dead gorgeous, then perhaps they will sell like hotcakes. I am afraid other cars like the Aura and New Malibu, while being OK for content have no major look appeal to separate them from all the rest. First GM did the head butt routine with VW, then Japan, and now must have a major sized headache from doing so. Leave the head butts for the animals in the wild and do the cool little side step, and dance around the competition while they are left standing in place.Loren  They seem to think of Saab as more worthy of a companion on the lot than would be the Buicks?Comments:Loren  $15,000 dollars for an XR fully loaded....   You sure are a generous sort. LOL  Keeping the Impala FWD would also be a mistake because Chevy is GM\\'s biggest, most recognized brand in the US with the biggest dealer network so it\\'s cars have to be able to reach every market. So whereever the competition goes, so must Chevy go. Chevy has to be the \"all around brand\" for GM with a mix of crossover SUVs, Full size SUVs, midsize FWD sedans (since there are no real affordable RWD midsize family sedans today), RWD full size sedans, Trucks, and of course the RWD Camaro. They also need more competitive compacts, and subcompacts. Just out of curiosity, if Chevy were to make a CTS for the masses, what exactly would happen to Cadillac & Buick?Truth is exterior styling is not all that important to most buyers. If style was important the Mazda6 & Aura would be better sellers, probably allowing the Altima (which is already a graet seller) to outsell the Camcords. If GM can design a soild, nicely styled Malibu, soon offer a two-mode hybrid, the I4/6spd auto combo on all models (not just the LTZ) and keep the 3.6 competitive, eventually offer bluetooh, nav and dual-zone climate control and I think the car will be successful.Pontiac should go RWD competely, but focus mainly on SportBuick should continue to appeal to the older crowd. Cadillac go RWD/AWD competely (which they plan to do) and focus on Luxury and performance.Saturn should continue to be the \"Euro\" brand, somewhere between mainstream Chevy and Sporty Pontiac.That way GM can focus it\\'s money on marketing and improving cars like the Malibu, Aura, G6 and Lacrosse, while keeping them from competiting with each other head to head.  Chevy / GM should start building a car slightly smaller than a CTS, in RWD for the masses. No, not a CTS look alike, but another very modern, very uniquely styled car, which could be sold for under $24K for the masses. It would not effect the CTS or Buick lines all that much. Well not as much as the New Malibu being the demise of the G6 sedan and the Aura XE base, plastic hubcap models. The next Nova should be stylish, RWD and handle well. For those not interested in these qualities, you have all the rest to choose from. And that is ultimately the problem. Aura is a good car? Well yeah, but there is all the rest. If it had a different look and RWD, it would be kickin\\' some butt as I type this. So who should Saab team up with? Is it Pontiac, Saturn or the current parring with Cadillac?Loren  Have you driven the Aura XR yet? I would value it around $21,999 as a pretty fair value. Sure, a large hit is taken come resale time, but what can you do. I guess if you could get it for say $20K, that would be an equalizer of sort. A fear one may have of owning the XR is that the New Malibu does become wildly popular in the 3.6 model and it sells a thousand or two below the price of the XR Aura. That would hurt. Anyway, Saturn may sell you an Astra for $15,ooo, or maybe not. Anyone know the pricing of the little guy yet?Loren   Aura is a good car? Well yeah, but there is all the rest. If it had a different look and RWD, it would be kickin\\' some butt as I type this. Chrysler has some RWD models, that aren\\'t doing very well. To make a RWD car move, you need V8 power, and with that, you get low mileage. The RWD models with V6 engines are just plain slow. I don\\'t think a RWD car can compete in this segment. Sure, they would sell a few (to people like you) but most people are not hung up on RWD. What is so great about RWD anyway? I don\\'t see the benefit.  The RWD models with V6 engines are just plain slow.IIRC, the last test of a Chrysler 300 Touring (with the 3.5L V6) ran 0-60 in 7.3 seconds (in a Car and Driver 6-way comparo of full-size sedans - the 300 placed 3rd of 6). That\\'s not plain slow to me. In fact, it\\'s faster than my Accord, which is plenty peppy.What is so great about RWD anyway? I don\\'t see the benefit. Bury your right foot in a 2006 Altima 3.5 and you\\'ll suddenly see why FWD has its limits, and RWD has its pluses in the handling department (which is why most sport-sedans are RWD).  Well the Chrysler took off well, but I suppose all those in need of the chop top look, with slab sides have already bought this car. Oh wait, the new Camaro has much the same properties. A V6 with a RWD is not going to be slow. Where did you get that notion from? The Ultimate Driving Machines are all RWD with those inline 6 engines. There are many benifits to RWD. There are some drawbacks too. If New Malibu is to be a FWD on the same platform, then what is the need for yet another car as the Aura? It is the very same car. And it is close to being say a Japan make car. Guess it is hard to explain, but I see a need for some NEW cars if GM is going to get an edge. I applaude Chrysler over the years for trying new ideas on designs. Of course they have to be practical at the same time. I think the new 300 and Charger have too smallish of windows, and perhaps a bit too much bulk look to satisfy enough customers. It did well, but now it may not in the end be well enough. Actually, shape wise, those previous 300M cars were hot looking to me. I little funny in the snout, but mostly a wonderful sporty line. Where is the sporty lines on the new stuff from GM, other than the Solstice and Sky?And there may come a day when ANY design without that chop top and high belt line, flat sided car would be welcomed. My goodness, even the old Nova would be more easy to live with. Nowadays one may dislocate an arm simply trying to hand an elbow out the window. And who loves this claustrophobic feel anyway. Raise the roof and lower the doors, please!As for how many people prefer the RWD to FWD, it is hard to say. I do think the knowledge about driving, the love of driving and cars, seems to be on the wane. Perhaps a plain old boxy SUV is more than enough style, and FWD vs RWD means nothing. Many can not drive RWD vehicles, which would explain many roll over accidents in my area. These are said to be rare, yet in my area I can listen to the scanner or read off the Net all the accidents as they occur in my CHP area. A LOT of roll over accidents. And on those rare days of rain, a lot of accidents. Maybe to nanny the new generation of drivers, they do need to say with FWD or should I say make more cars FWD or put all the electronic devices on all those RWD cars to keep them upright. Trust me, RWD drives well when the driver drives well. Loren about RWD L I N K and L I N K 2  As I stated earlier, it won\\'t happen because Chevy does not need a RWD Midsize family car for the \"masses\" in it\\'s lineup...it needs a FWD family sedan like everyone else is offering. What if Chevy were to produce the particular vehicle that you speak of in VOLUME and it just happened to be a poor seller?GM ends up back at Square One.In a perfect world, perhaps we\\'d still have RWD Nova\\'s, BelAir\\'s etc...but the world ain\\'t perfect. And by way of sales, it seems pretty clear that in the midsize sedan world, the majority prefer FWD, especially up north where the notion is that FWD and AWD are better for wintry traction (Whether true or not)GM simply cannot afford to take big risks with the Malibu. The Impala is diffentl the 300/Magnum/Charger revived a market that saw a need for RWD Big family sedans. Yet after all this time, no company so far has offerd a midsize RWD family sedan in this country? Why? Probably because the perception of the Accord and Camry have pushed people away from that idea. Many of today\\'s buyers have a lack of trust for GM\\'s products, what makes you think buidling a RWD Sporty Nova would make them more inclined to buy it over say the FWD, already established Chevy Malibu? Sure GM would be the only car in that market, but let\\'s face it, GM hasn\\'t built up enough new recognition to be reviving market segments (exception the Camaro) I don\\'t see it happening. You want a RWD family sedan? Go to Aussie or wait on the G8 or next G6.And as far as the Malibu hurting G6 and Aura sales, the G6 should be up for redesign a year or so after the Malibu is released, making it RWD (since all Pontiacs will be) and the Aura is hurting mainly because GM didn\\'t have the guts to give the car a 4 cylinder engine and allow it to be the true Opel that it should have been. The Aura is obviously \"competive\" seeing as it has beaten the Camry in two comparison tests and came close behind the Altima in one as wellThe Malibu will be that much better.GM can have two capable FWD midsize sedans (maybe a third one in the LaCrosse) if they design and market them right. One can be mainstream, one Euro-sporty and one Ultra-Luxury.And for what it\\'s worth few \"Uniquely styled\" cars are sold in high numbers to the masses...exception Civic. Flops include the Maxima, Quest, Aztec, etc. etc.Saab shouldn\\'t team up with anybody, the cars should stick to their fundalmental quirky roots and stay true to their heritage. Plain and simple.Bottomline..the FWD Malibu ain\\'t going nowhere...but it would be a much better car if GM would outfit it with optional bluetooth, navigation, dual-zone climate control and more options.  What is so great about RWD anyway?advantages with some disadvatages - the 2 main advantages have to do with vehicle weight distribution which can get close to 50-50 on a well thought out (see BMW) RWD sedan (the reason why none of the cars in this group can ever be a true sports sedan is because 60% (or more) of the weight is over the front wheels), the elimination of torque steer (the inevitable consequence of alot of torque channeled thru the same wheels that are doing the steering). On the other side of the coin is the benefits (traction) of having that extra wieght over the drive wheels in a FWD car, and generally better FE simply becsuse FWD cars tend to weigh less overall. It has been so long that RWD sedans have been available to us in the \\'mass market\\' classes that I really think that the consumer would have a tough time readjusting to them particulary those drivers that do have to drive on bad roads. Can you say \\'sandbags in the trunk\\'? And, since FE is becoming such an influence on buying decisions these days, I can\\'t imagine the FWD is going anywhere despite the better natural balance (and corresponding handling benefits) of RWD, although in those areas that aren\\'t afflicted too much with snow covered roads (most of the country) buying a RWD car, if available, seems like a good decision to me.IMO, Detroit\\'s future is in \\'traditional\\' V8/RWD layouts much like the 300C and gas prices will largely determine how successful they are. Also IMO, Ford/GM/Chrysler\\'s inabilities to build truly competitive and efficient smaller engines (going all the way back to the \\'K\\' cars and the GM \\'X\\' cars) will doom them to second tier status in this particular vehicle type if for no other reason than FE (with power) sells.  So basically the G6 as RWD is OK, but not for the New Malibu. Now we have the best offerings under $25K coming from Pontiac. So this may be the decade for Pontiac? New Malibu, while a good car, is head to head with some stiff competition. Aura, so far is a low selling car.I do see your points, however.For those in need or prefering FWD in the larger car will have to move up to Buick. Wonder if that is going to work out OK?As for uniquely styled, I did not mean ugly. Loren  Bury your right foot in a 2006 Altima 3.5 and you\\'ll suddenly see why FWD has its limits...Yes, but the problem is not FWD it is putting these excessively powerful V6 engines in these type of cars.But, HP numbers sell so overpowered FWD sedans are built and then most who buy them never even get the engine to 3000 RPM.Perhaps the solution is to bury your right foot in the 2.5 and realize that this will accelerate fast enought to meet your needs or, if not, buy something else with RWD or AWD.  Yes, but the problem is not FWD it is putting these excessively powerful V6 engines in these type of cars. Excessive being a judgement call? I\\'ll contend to you that a V6 Altima is \\'safer\\' than the same car with a 175hp 4 banger, the Accord V6 safer, the torque steering XR vs. the XE etc. etc. by simply having that extra power to cope with a multitude of real life traffic situations. A number of FWD V8s (Impala SS for example) have the same \\'problem\\' or maybe these cars have too much power (in your judgement), as well?  I\\'ll contend to you that a V6 Altima is \\'safer\\' than the same car with a 175hp 4 banger, the Accord V6 safer, the torque steering XR vs. the XE etc. etc. by simply having that extra power to cope with a multitude of real life traffic situations.That\\'s got to be \"Stop the presses!\" front page news: V6s are safer than I4s. I seriously doubt it.  In the case of the Accord, it may well be true. The V6 has ESC standard, and it\\'s not available on the I4s.  V6s are safer than I4s. I seriously doubt it. Perhaps you are thinking about safety in a passive sense, things like #of airbags, crash test results, electronic safety \\'control\\' systems etc. AS OPPOSED to safety in an active sense - the ability of any car to avoid difficult situations. That extra HP let\\'s say to pass that semi on a 2 lane highway comfortably or merging onto an interstate off a short on ramp. In short there is more to a safe car than how well it crashes or how much a computer will alow you to do before IT takes \\'control\\'., and those \\'active\\' safety features (things that the driver does control) and the resources with which he/she has to work with I am talking about. Those things that can help you avoid an accident(acceleration, braking, and handling) are what in my mind make a truly \\'safe\\' car. If we are going to accept the contention that the Mazda6 is the best handling car of this group than it is also likely the safest car in this group - at least in that regard. And conversely if we know that the Fusion V6 (or 4) is the least powerful, it therefore must be considered the least safe in that regard as well. I am not labelling the 4 cylinder versions of these cars necessarily unsafe, heaven knows that even that 4 banger Fusion is much much safer in almost all respects than even cars made a short 10-15 years ago or so - the early to mid 90s - some really bad examples of \\'wheezmobiles\\' - and we certainly all lived through it, didn\\'t we?  I guess by that measure, those 500 hp luxury sedans that can go 0-60 in under 5 seconds are really safe.Let\\'s get real. The powerful I4s in today\\'s mid-sized cars--more powerful in some cases than the V8s of not long ago-- have more than enough power for safe driving. OTOH, the power waiting in those V6s can be an enticement to drive faster, for less safety for the driver and those around him/her.  while most medical experts might tell you that a glass of wine a day is good for you - they will most assuredly tell you that a whole bottle/day is not! I would also be willing to bet you that, as you drive home tonight, and witness anybody driving in an unsafe manner that there is likely little correleration between what he/she is doing and how much HP their car has, meaning you will certainly find as many \\'bad\\' drivers \\'squeezing\\' their 4 bangers, as you will other drivers \\'enjoying\\' their V8 300C SRT8s....  IMO, Detroit\\'s future is in \\'traditional\\' V8/RWD layouts much like the 300C and gas prices will largely determine how successful they are. I don\\'t think gas prices will ever get low enough (in the near future) to make V8/RWD cars big sellers. The \"Big 3\" will have to develop competitive small engines/cars, or they will simply cease to exist, IMO. I don\\'t think these companies can survive selling only trucks.  actually I believe that GM/Ford/Chrysler CAN survive selling things like only trucks, SUVs and minivans. Total F150/Silverado sales make Camcord sales look minor league and Chrysler has owned the minivan market since they invented the thing. The problem as I see it, is the \\'fat\\' infrastructure that those particular mfgrs. have cultivated that makes it impossible for them to do just that! \\'Detroit\\' does make some nice (and class defining) trucks, much as \\'Japan\\' does the same thing in the car markets.  But accidents and unsafe driving are not caused by speed, or excessive speed, but by inattention and unskilled driving. Mainly inattention.  Inattention at 90 mph is more likely to bite you than inattention at 60 mph. That\\'s why we have speed limits.You could use your viewpoint, though, to show how there is no benefit to having an I4 vs. a V6, because accidents are not caused by lack of speed, or acceleration, but by inattention and unskilled driving.  on October 15th. I spoke with Chad in their customer service center and he informed me that once production begins on October 15th we can expect to see the new Malibu in showrooms within the next 4 to 8 weeks (I guess it depends on how far you are from the plant in Kansas). That\\'s not really the news I was looking for, as I was hoping the car would be in showrooms by September or so. I am thinking of the Malibu or the Saturn Aura but I like the styling of the Malibu a bit better, not to mention I\\'m thinking it will be better equipped in the LTZ model (as compared to the Aura XR model) but I don\\'t know that for sure. How do others feel about not being able to test drive this car until November or December of this year?  The \"best offerings\" is purely subjective, especially if the G6 going RWD equals \"better\" also, I hope you aren\\'t equating the succcess of the Aura with the new Malibu because if that is the case you are ignoring some MAJOR differences between the position of the new \\'Bu and new Aura.-Aura has no I4=Malibu will have the class leading I4/V6 on LTZ.-Chevy\\'s dealer network is HUGE compared to Saturn-The Malibu is a more established name than the Aura and Chevy has played in this market more heavily than Saturn.The Aura is a slow seller b/c it doesn\\'t have a I4 and it\\'s saddled with No Haggle Pricing. Mailbu without a doubt will sell better.  Captain2,You hypothesized that the Mazda6 might be the best-handling mid-size car and that the Fusion, both the V6 and I4, having the least powerful engine, might therefore be the least safe in the mid-size segment.That logic totally ignores the fact that Mazdas and Fusions have exactly the same engines and the Fusions (Milans, MKZs) are based on a slightly modified Mazda chassis.When it comes to safety, it is helpful to examine some raw data. From the Internet:Nationally, in 2005, there were 43,443 fatalities. Of these, 25,347 were a result of road departure, 9,188 intersection-related, and 4,881 were pedestrians.Does a more powerful engine prevent a driver from running off of the road? I doubt it.Will a powerful engine (who decides the definition of powerful?) help a driver get out of a tight bind? Sure, sometimes. But avoiding the bind in the first place is a better remedy. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.Our 221-horsepower 3.0-liter V6 Ford engine is quite adequate for our AWD Fusion, thank you. At no time during our seven months of ownership have I said to myself, \"Gee, I wish this car had 270 horsepower.\"As a safety matter, I just don\\'t see horsepower to be a significant factor. I once totaled a 1958 VW Beetle (32 horsepower). But the reason was driver error: I fell asleep at the wheel and took out a guardrail.  the reason was driver error: I fell asleep at the wheel and took out a guardrail.Yikes, glad you didn\\'t take yourself out in the process! :surprise:A \\'58 Beetle? Cool!!!  Thegraduate (me) said: Bury your right foot in a 2006 Altima 3.5 and you\\'ll suddenly see why FWD has its limits... jeffyscott said: Yes, but the problem is not FWD it is putting these excessively powerful V6 engines in these type of cars. But, then we\\'re returning to elroy\\'s statement that said the Chrysler RWD V6 cars were slow (which isn\\'t true if you consider sub-8 second 60 MPH runs very slow - it\\'s similar to a Fusion V6).Heck, the V6 RWD sedans (Charger/300) from Chrysler are faster than the V8 RWD sedans from Ford (Crown Victoria, Grand Marquis, Town Car), which make the 0-60 run in something like 7.9 seconds (according to C&D).  \"As a safety matter, I just don\\'t see horsepower to be a significant factor. I once totaled a 1958 VW Beetle (32 horsepower). But the reason was driver error: I fell asleep at the wheel and took out a guardrail. \"Good statistics on the road departures. I think the whole \"more powerful = safer\" argument has little merit.Plus one for driver error. I totaled my first car, road departure / driver error. It had 110 horsepower, in a midsize sedan.While I admit I\\'ve been in situations before where I want more power, I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever needed more power.  That logic totally ignores the fact that Mazdas and Fusions have exactly the same engines and the Fusions (Milans, MKZs) are based on a slightly modified Mazda chassis. urnws- I think you are missing my point. In the sentences before I am contending that vehicle dynamics (power, handling, braking) are largely what makes a car safe and given that contention that a beeter handling car (the 6 in this case) is a safer car than the others in this group simply by accepting the generally held view that the 6 handles better. And likewise, if any car is down on power (like the Fusion (or the 6), for example) the opposite must also be true. Of your quoted 25347 road departure accidents, would be willing to bet that many of those were just like the one you had in your VW, not necessarily falling asleep at the wheel but probably inattention, cell phones, and/or \\'playing\\' with the stereo - all the kind of things that are very unrelated to the task and responsibilities at hand. I never said anything like that 221hp (or even the 150-175hp in the 4 bangers) wasn\\'t enough in any particular car (although you can go back in any number of my posts and find a number of times that I have said it just isn\\'t competitive these days) - HP and relative FE numbers don\\'t lie. What I did say though, is that I think the 270 is safer than the 221, not because it is anything that any of us that have it use even occassionally, but because it is there, in reserve, on those very rare occassions that we HAVE to use it - having that extra 50hp gives you the option of \\'aggressively\\' (bad choice of words, perhaps) avoid a number of real life traffic situations similar to those I specifically mentioned. Not a whole lot different than having a car with a great set of brakes, the same sort of very rare times that a 10 or 15 feet shorter stopping distance can make a helluva difference. When was the last time that any of us can remember \\'locking them up\\' (or getting the the ABS to engage)? If anybody out there can honestly answer \\'it happens even semi-regularly\\' - well, then they are driving too \\'aggressively\\' (good choice of words), their ABS is malfunctioning, and their insurance rates are justifably stratospheric.  Sorry. I love having more power from a V6 than a 4-cylinder, but a V6 being \"safer\" due to it\\'s power reserve is simply ludicrous! For all the power \"in reserve\" that a V6 has, a 4-cylinder car, in general, handles better than a nose-heavy V6, due to it\\'s lower front-end weight and better weight distribution. Great acceleration can help you avoid an accident, but so can an emergency lane change.Do I think a 4-cylinder model is safer than a similar V6 model? No way. Having both passive and active elements help to avoid/survive an accident, as well as defensive driving, paying FULL attention to the road ahead, around, and behind you, driving appropriately for road and weather conditions, and properly maintaining your vehicle.  I think BMW has it right with their 230 hp, RWD, perfectly balanced chassis. 230 hp isn\\'t big these days, but in a 328, its sublime.  a 4-cylinder car, in general, handles better than a nose-heavy V6absolutely - and therefore are \\'safer\\' -in that respect, than the V6 - and effectively a tradeoff from a safety perspective - what you gain in handling abilities vs. what you are sacrificing in power.a true story - recently \\'stuck\\' behind a little Korean subcompact, both of us attempting to merge off a short entrance ramp onto a busy highway that happens to be move at about 75 all the time. By the time he actually got to the end of the on ramp, he was huffing and puffing all the way up to maybe 45 or 50! The ensuing screeching of \\'locked up\\' brakes and \\'panic\\' lane changes , of course followed as he then \\'forced\\' his merge, all from those 75 mph \\'victims\\' of this certainly underpowered car cutting in front of them. Me, being relatively far behind him (maybe 100 yds.), understanding what he was attempting to do (and what he was attempting to do it in), and anticipating his probable inability to do it, bailed to the road shoulder but I thought I was about to be \\'taken out\\'. What would expect this guy to do? Stop at the end of the ramp! That may be even worse than what he actually did do. And then you tell me, that having some extra power is ludricious and not safety related? Now that would be ludricruous! Granted an extreme example and I\\'ll even admit that even a 4 banger from this particular group could at least approach a condition safe merging speed. BTW, I drive this ramp every day and left to my own means (and my own 268hp) I can easily hit that 75mph to merge. The Avalon, I drive, a safer car if only because of that \\'surplus\\' of HP! Or maybe we should all drive around in (90hp?) Kias and then blame situations like this on the fact that many drivers largely ignore speed limits or tend to drive at speeds that \\'keep up with the flow\\'? Oops can\\'t do that either, give it enough time and even those Kias can (and do) move well above posted speeds as well!  For those of you who think buying a Fusion is a bad bet because Ford is going out of business, you might want to take note: Ford just announced a 2nd quarter profit of $258M NOT including the proceeds from the sale of Aston Martin. That\\'s right - profit, not loss. Revenue was up 6% from last year. And they did it while cutting rental fleet sales. And that doesn\\'t really include the new Taurus/Sable or Focus sales and only a few Escape sales which are setting a record pace.It\\'s amazing what can happen when you cut unnecessary costs, build high quality desirable vehicles at sustainable volumes.  Definitely good news for Ford. This news maynot help dealing with the Union, but regardless, maybe they are on teh right path to profitability. They certainly aren\\'t out of the woods yet.  Ford just announced a 2nd quarter profit of $258M NOT including the proceeds from the sale of Aston Martin. That\\'s right - profit, not loss.That\\'s great news. Thanks for posting it, Allen.  Yes, amazing, shock & awe news. Time will tell, with foot notes and post scripts to come.I would not take the time to read the small print and instead just wait and see how this all plays out. I don\\'t see the stock price doubling today, and big inverstors now have the data at hand.  The 2.5L I4 is said to be an option in the 2009 Fusion so this might interest some of you.TwinForce  I would not take the time to read the small print and instead just wait and see how this all plays out. I don\\'t see the stock price doubling today, and big inverstors now have the data at hand.Seeing that Mulally was quoted as saying that they won\\'t be profitable for the year and still expect that won\\'t happen until 2009, I\\'d say you\\'re right. It\\'s still good news no matter how you spin it and shows that they are doing something right. BTW, Ford\\'s NA market share increased a few tenths too. Being able to reduce fleet sales and increase market share is not an easy thing to do no matter who you are.  However, a skilled driving manuever to avoid an accident may be to get the \"hell out of there!\" And to truly do that, you may need to stomp on the gas. You can\\'t \\'get the hell out\\' in an I4 unless its turbocharged. A good quality V6 will get you out of there in a hurry; which is sometimes needed.  However, a skilled driving maneuver to avoid an accident may be to get the \"hell out of there!\"Agreed, my driving instructor referred to that as \"being somewhere else,\" implying anywhere else is better.And to truly do that, you may need to stomp on the gas.This was referred to as \"changing zip codes\" among other things. This is one remedy, although rarely is it the only solution unless its coupled with \"red fog\" and \"no way am I going to let that [experlative] in front of me.\"You can\\'t \\'get the hell out\\' in an I4 unless its turbocharged.I totally, completely, and categorically disagree with this statement. A moderate 4 cylinder engine and a responsive transmission (or better still, a manual) will do fine.  \"I totally, completely, and categorically disagree with this statement. A moderate 4 cylinder engine and a responsive transmission (or better still, a manual) will do fine.\"AMEN  OK... let me add that the car should be under 3,300 lbs, and then the I4 can be quite good...., but still... there isn\\'t that EXTRA oomph you get from say a Honda 3.0 V6 or a 2.0 Turbo from Audi.  With the caveat that I wouldn\\'t want to be driving a Scion xA with 4 people in it while trying to pass a vehicle on a 2 lane road on an incline. Of course, in that situation, most of the cars would be passing me :P  But what about the fact that V6 versions of cars with I4\\'s generally have better/safer suspension setups, bigger/wider tires, and more agressive braking components than the I4 couterpart. Any loss of handling due to front heavy weight of V6 is usually more than compensated for by all of these other factors.  The 230 HP would be just right if it got significantly better mileage than the 300 HP 330i! Since it gets about the same gas mileage, I\\'d opt for the extra 70 horses.  a lot of times people merge too slowly onto a fast moving freeway thereby causing a traffic jam/slowdown/chain reaction of problems not only because their vehicle is underpowered, but mainly because they are idiotic, crazy, uninformed, and stubbborn. They simply refuse to waste the little bit of extra gas useage in order to accelerate at a reasonable rate so that they can merge safely. They are either too cheap or too dumb and instead choose to merge onto a 75-85 MPH flow of traffic at 45 MPH!!!! They choose saving a few drops of gas over safety and probably cause another 1,000 drivers 1000X more gas wastage due to traffic jams than they would have wasted themselves. Anyway, enough of my rant. If you have a 300 HP car then you should be able to merge at full speed even at 1/4 throttle. If you have 200 HP then you should be able to merge at full speed even on a short ramp at 1/2 throttle acceleration.If you have 100 HP then floor the damn thing! That will help!   The 230 HP would be just right if it got significantly better mileage than the 300 HP 330i! Since it gets about the same gas mileage, I\\'d opt for the extra 70 horses.What 300 hp car gets good gas mileage?  The BMW 335i, sorry, I said 330, but meant 335.  I drive a 130 hp 1996 Accord with an automatic to work everyday. On my way home is a moderately long but steep uphill onramp onto I-65. Traffic generally flows around 70 MPH. If I accelerated modestly (making the 4-speed auto shift at around 3,200 RPM, say) I would barely be at 50-55 MPH by the end of the ramp. Instead, I use more of the car\\'s available power (130 hp comes at 5200 RPM), wind up to just above 4,000 RPM, and manage to be going at least 65 MPH when my chance to merge comes in).  Pssshhhh, everyone knows that Honda I4\\'s are exceptional and out perform the \"numbers\"   Weeeellllll, 130 horsepower isn\\'t particularly fast in a 2900 lb car, saddled with a 4-speed automatic. I love the car, but not for its speed.You can jam the throttle to the carpet from a stop, and get nary a chirp from the tires. I\\'ll just pretend it is AWD or something.Interestingly, when I was a couple of years younger (and the car was too) I had a chance to run 0-60 in a flat, broad area. It took just over 10 seconds, and that\\'s with ~150k miles on the clock.On the other hand, my 2006 Accord (5AT, 166 hp) does the same between 8 and 9 seconds).*By the way, I never brake-torque the engine (it seems really bad for it). I just hit the gas from a stop.  Assuming we a talking about newish midsize sedans, merging too slowly is not about the car, it is all about the driver. The vast majority seem to think their car will break or something if it goes over 3000 rpms.I believe all of these new midsize cars, in 4 cyl form, can get to 60 in under 10 seconds...I think that is plenty of acceleration capability for accomplishing this task.  The 335 is a turbo, cost $9K more, gets way less MPGs (who cares tho! - its a 335!) and your insurance premium doubles vs. the 328. If I wanted a race car I\\'d get a Mustang and save a bunch of money. High HP is one of the things you use the least in 95% of your drives. 230 in a RWD setup is perfect.The 328 is a mid size sedan - right? One of the best out there for the money. Fantastic leases.  The 328 is a mid size sedan - right?It\\'s compact at best. $35k for a compact is high for me (space is crucial for me, I\\'m 6\\'4\" and a big guy!)The 5-series is midsize.The 7-series is full size.  \"You can\\'t \\'get the hell out\\' in an I4 unless its turbocharged.\"Did anyone watch the video I posted on CarSpace of my Accord running from 5 to 80 mph? 60 comes in well under 8 seconds and 80 in about 10. Before the acceleration ramp even ends, I overtake an Expedition that had a big lead on me before I took off. I think that is well above the acceleration capability of the average vehicle on the road.  Did anyone watch the video I posted on CarSpace of my Accord running from 5 to 80 mph?Yes, I saw the video, but I would rather not have to punch it as soon as I back out of my parking spot. With the V6 you can wait until you get halfway down the ramp, and pick a spot to blend into the traffic without anyone having to slow down for you.Don\\'t get me wrong. I have nothing against 4 cylinder Accords. My 92 Accord (140hp) was plenty fast enough for me for 12 years. It\\'s just so much easier, and takes less advanced planning, with the 6 cylinder\\'s highway acceleration.  Just to clarify:- The 335 is a turbo yes, cost $9K more no- gets way less MPGs (who cares tho! - its a 335!) probably 34 highway after being broken in, my 330 got 34 mpg at 65- and your insurance premium doubles vs. the 328 not even close.If I wanted a race car I\\'d get a Mustang and save a bunch of money okay, but these cars aren\\'t even in the same league.High HP is one of the things you use the least in 95% of your drives. 230 in a RWD setup is perfect. disagree, my turbo 4 gets floored quite a bit when merging  disagree, my turbo 4 gets floored quite a bit when merging Wow, your driveway must be directly on I-40 or something. I have 130 hp Accord, drive into an urban setting with 70+ mph traffic daily, and have several mountains around.I can\\'t tell ya the last time I had to floor it. And it\\'s a 4-speed auto.  You can rationalize anything if you try hard enough.There is no way you can justify needing more than a good modern 4 cylinder engine. Just admit that it\\'s a want and move on.  I never needed a 6cylinder before, and I don\\'t need one now. But it is more fun fun fun with it, and I don\\'t want to go back. Of course, for someone who would never use the extra power anyway, it would be a complete waste of $$$.  There is no way you can justify needing more than a good modern 4 cylinder engineAnd of those \\'good modern\\' 4 bangers let\\'s say the Honda, Toyota and Nissan engines every one of them is pulling something close to 20lbs./HP which starts to become a problem in this regard as these cars get larger and heavier. The better V6s will only cost you about 3-4 mpg (or $10.00/month) assumming 27 vs. 30 mpg, 12k/year, and $3/gallon. 10 bucks a small price to pay IMO - it is possible these days to have our cake and eat it too. I\\'ll obviously opt for the securities offered by the 250hp (or more) - you are the one that can be judgmental and tell me that \\'I don\\'t need it\\'.  The 335 is a turbo yes, cost $9K more no OK - $10K more then. I can get a 328 for $36K with the Premium Pac and the Sport Pac. The 335 is at least $44K with those Pacs, but try to find one with JUST those Pacs. You can\\'t. The ones I\\'ve seen at 2 dealers were all loaded.gets way less MPGs (who cares tho! - its a 335!) probably 34 highway after being broken in, my 330 got 34 mpg at 65Huh? At 65? What? A 330 ain\\'t a turbo and it won\\'t get 34 mpgs, unless you\\'re going downhill the whole way.High HP is one of the things you use the least in 95% of your drives. 230 in a RWD setup is perfect. disagree, my turbo 4 gets floored quite a bit when mergingI thought you had a 330? You got the only one coming out of the factory with a turbo 4 then. You have to floor turbos to get \\'em up and out. I don\\'t want that kind of wildness going on every time I step on the gas.The 335 is sweet, but impractical.  Whoa there Sparky - I never said you shouldn\\'t get a V6. Quite the opposite - I bought one myself and would probably do it again given the choice. But I don\\'t try to justify it by saying it\\'s safer or has better resale. It\\'s a personal preference just like a stick vs. automatic tranny, leather vs. cloth seats, etc.  It\\'s a personal preference just like a stick vs. automatic tranny, leather vs. cloth seats, etc. Well I have seen Accords and the like with trailer hitches welded to them.

It brought my dining room set home in a 5x8 U-haul trailer with no problems at all, but it doesn\\'t tow nearly as well as the much much newer Subie that is also a 4 cylinder.  \"I would rather not have to punch it as soon as I back out of my parking spot. \"Ouch! :P \"With the V6 you can wait until you get halfway down the ramp, and pick a spot to blend into the traffic without anyone having to slow down for you.

So we are talking just under a one second difference from 0-60 MPH, say 7.5 seconds for an I4 manual versus 6.6 for a V6 automatic. I could get in the same gap you could as long as my response is within one second quicker than you. Not that much advanced planning.Under one second is not much time, but what are we talking in distance? From a dead stop to 60 MPH, your car would be 79 feet ahead of mine. (Once both vehicles are traveling at a steady 60 MPH, a 0.9 second difference in time equates to 79 feet, right?).Noticeable, sure, but not as much of a difference as some here are making it seem. Certainly not half of an on ramp, and definitely not some kind of safety concern.  79 feet is a lot, when the gap between cars is only 40-50 feet. 1 second or less, can mean a lot in a tight situation. It\\'s easier to merge into fast moving traffic with the V6, is all I\\'m saying. I\\'m not saying it\\'s necessary, just nice to have.  79\\' is a lot, as you could avoid even a 79\\' long semi which the I4 would be crushed by....  If the gap between cars is 40-50 feet, and the average car is 15 feet long, then if you and I were on the same onramp I\\'d get on the highway directly behind the car which you got in front of. Just one car back.  But that is what onramps are for... they don\\'t just dump you out onto the highway directly in front of a semi!Elroy and I on an onramp... if he was able to get right in front of a semi, I\\'d just have to pull right behind it. No big deal.  Most of the V6 family sedans are \"above aberage\" in terms of acceleration, and most of the I4\\'s are \"average.\" I don\\'t think that makes the V6\\'s safer, however. Once you get quicker than average, in the hands of most drivers, the car becomes less safe. I for one know that I would be a less safe driver behind the wheel of a faster car. It\\'s that tendency to think you can beat that semi while merging instead of just dropping in behind and then passing safely.This was proven for me when I was shopping for cars, in the insurance quotes I received. I looked at both the regular and the MazdaSpeed Mazda6. As far as insurance is concerned, replacement parts and crashworthiness should have been about the same, right? However, the faster car (the MazdaSpeed) would have been much more to insure (overall, \"less safe\" in the eyes of the insurance company).  More power can be more or less safe. It all depends on the driver. As far as insurance being more on higher performance cars, that usually applies more to \"sports cars\" because insurance companies assume these cars will be driven faster. The higher cost of the Speed6 over the regular 6 could be more about the higher cost of replacing the car (doesn\\'t the Speed6 cost more), than it being less safe.  \"OK - $10K more then\"Ummm how about $6k more according to the BMW website? Base price of 328 vs 335.\"Huh? At 65? What? A 330 ain\\'t a turbo and it won\\'t get 34 mpgs, unless you\\'re going downhill the whole way.\"So I have to ask, are you saying I\\'m lying? The 330 has better gas mileage than some of the 4 bangers.\"I thought you had a 330?\"I have and had a number of cars, so what?\"The 335 is sweet, but impractical.\"Understood, it is impractical for you.  would betcha, elroy5, that insurance rates for specific cars have a whole lot more to do with the age demographic (average age of a buyer of a specific car model or type) than it does on anything related to HP. A Mazdaspeed anything is, IMO, the perfected \\'rice rocket\\' and certainly more appealing to the generally younger buyer. A Camry V6 should be cheaper to insure than that Speed6 simply because of that and despite those HP numbers being similar.  Exactly, Captain. I think the reason a V6 Accord would be more expensive to insure than the 4cylinder is more about the cost of the car, than the performance.  Not only that, but Insurance companies live for finding excuses to charge more for insurance. Ohh.... you got the V6 version, BAM! We\\'re charging you a lot more!Any excuse will do for criminally setup auto insurance business.  If the car oozes the words sport, or speed, Insurance company\\'s turn on there profit driven charges.  OK, Accord vs. Accord, but make it the Speed6 vs. the Accord6 where the vehicle MSRPs are about the same, the Speed6 should cost more to insure, the Speed buyer is probably younger and likes all that \\'look at me - I can go fast\\' bling.  OK, Accord vs. Accord, but make it the Speed6 vs. the Accord6 where the vehicle MSRPs are about the same, the Speed6 should cost more to insure, This is where I think we get into assuming the mentality of the driver. Assuming the Speed driver would be a greater risk would be wrong, IMO. That doesn\\'t mean insurance companies don\\'t do it, I would, however disagree with that. If both cars are \"midsize sedans\" and the MSRP is the same, the insurance cost should be the same also.  Assuming the Speed driver would be a greater risk would be wrong, IMO. That doesn\\'t mean insurance companies don\\'t do it, I don\\'t think they do. Most insurance companies determine their rates statisticly. if 3 percent of accords sold are involved in an accident, and 4 percent of mazda speed 6\\'s sold are involved in accidents, the speed 6 will get a higher rate. that\\'s why you pay more depending on where you live, age, sex, record, and type of car.its all bassed on statistics.  Andres, your ignorance is glaring.In addition to all the driver demographics, vehicle demographics are taken into consideration. (At least they are in CT where I am an insurance agent.) Things like frequency of involvement in claims (accidents or theft/vandalism), damagability (the cost of vehicle repairs for standardized damage tests), and value of vehicle are factored into the rate. In CT, and I think most or all of the country, performance car ratings (high perf, intermediate perf or sport car) were dropped several years ago in favor of a more accurate measure of risk based upon actual make/model loss experience. (This evolution was probably helped when Caddy brought out the Northstar. Suddenly, Grandma was driving a \"high performance\" car and after time the statistics showed that Granny driving her Caddy had a better record than many others cars.) The words \"sport\" or \"speed\" have nothing to do with it. A Grand Cherokee Loredo Sport does not cost more to insure than a Grand Cherokee Limited. They\\'re not in the class being discussed, they were just the first two examples that came to mind of the \"same\" vehicle with different sub-names not being rated differently due to a name.Another example was the 1984 Chrysler Laser and its Dodge counter part. They were the exact same car, except for the name. After a year or so on the market, the Chrysler became less expensive to insure than the Dodge. The Dodge didn\\'t become more expensive, the Chrysler became less expensive. Why? Try loss experience and what type of driver was attracted to each car. Another myth is that manual shift cars cost more to insure than cars with A/T. If anything, the manual shift MIGHT cost less to insure due to the car (generally) having a lower MSRP than the car with A/T.The statistics are based on hundreds of thousands or millions of cars over a period of time.   performance car ratings (high perf, intermediate perf or sport car) were dropped several years ago in favor of a more accurate measure of risk based upon actual make/model loss experience. Sounds a lot more logical and accurate to me.  Re our recent thread about the influence of warranty coverage on your mid-sized car purchase decision... Chrysler has just blown past every other automaker with its new lifetime powertrain warranty on all new Chrysler vehicles, including the Sebring and Avenger mid-sized sedans:http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=121856I think this is a great move for Chrysler to catch the attention of buyers, similar to what Hyundai did eight years ago with its 10 year/100k warranty. But Chrysler needs to follow up just as Hyundai did, by greatly improving their products--specifically the Sebring and Avenger--as soon as possible.  I leased a Speed6 GT the end of Feb. 2006 and really loved and enjoyed the car very much. It was a real kick and pleasure to drive and I felt separated me from 99% of everything else on the road. It had speed, good looks, and all sorts of std. equipment most other cars did not have - keyless entry and starting, auto up/down all 4 windows, hid headlights, easy close trumk, adjustable height of headlights etc. But then the problems began which made me feel unconfident in the ability of the car to get me where I was going or getting home. First, the fuel pump went in Feb of this year in the middle of the snow storm here in the east. My wife & I were on 95 going to MD from NJ and the pump crapped out leaving us stranded and in real jepordy. It took a week and a half to get it fixed, and 4 months more to have Mazda pay me back for the expenses incurred. I decided to get rid of it and get something that has a better track record of durability, so I turned to the Legacy GT sedan. I am now driving the Legacy for around a week and like it too (not as much as the speed6 yet). BTW, I bought out of the Mazda lease 6 months early when I traded for the Legacy and wound up around $1,000 on the upside for the tradein. As I said, I like the Legacy too, but it doesn\\'t make me feel as good driving it as the speed6 did. Maybe because the speed6 was a 6 speed stick and the only 08 Legacy turbo I could get my hands on is an automatic. Also, the speed6 is a much more user friendly car, more storage and all gauges and information is viewable at one time, the Legacy has a computer info center on one led - only one screen at a time.If anyone has any questions about my experiences, feel free to ask me.Artour  I saw a commercial on TV about this tonight. The \"fine print\" at the bottom says not all models are covered under this new \"warranty.\"The warranty is not transferable......Most people don\\'t drive their vehicles for more than a few years. At least not the people I know.....maybe 3-4 years max and then they get new cars. The warranty doesn\\'t help subsequent owners and its pretty likely the 3 year/36,000 mile warranty already expired. Also, I don\\'t think the warranty will greatly persuade people to go out and buy a chrysler.  i agree, it is great for the buyer who intends to keep the car for 10 years. But since I lease Jeeps I could care less, I want to see lower payments than their current lease offers which are not as good as on my 04 Jeep. This is using all rebates, lease loyalty and affiliate discounts. Old Mike  you make a number of good points - the way these \\'extended warranties are structured can make them almost worthless to the average car buyer. Don\\'t believe the GM/Hyundai warranties are transferrable and you better believe that those mfgrs. know how fast mileage is accumulated and how long the average buyer keeps a car. It is, by any definition, a marketing \\'gimmick\\', IMO. Chrysler can \\'warranty\\' its cars forever but it doesn\\'t change their products, and Chrysler\\'s long term (Cerebus) future - which is shaky. Our compadre, akirby, can rage on all he wants about Ford\\'s first \\'profitable\\' quarter in a long long time, but it is really insignificant to the billions and billions they have lost recently - and the billions and billions more they had to borrow just so they could close some more plants and put even more Americans out of work. GM, OTH, while they have shown the same sort of ability to lose as much money as possible, seems content to simply become the world\\'s first Chinese \\'American\\' manufacturer.Given \\'Detroit\\'s\\' generally dire financial straits, I think buyers of those particular brands are really more likely to chance a worthless warranty because the company no longer exists, then they are to actually need to use that warranty in the first place.  There are very few models not covered--high performance cars, the big Mercedes-sourced van, and (interestingly) diesels, plus some fleet vehicles. But almost every vehicle is covered. Also, most long powertrain warranties don\\'t go past the original owner. It\\'s an inducement for someone to buy a Chrysler, much like the Hyundai/Kia/Mitsubishi warranty (which also doesn\\'t transfer to other owners).  There are very few models not covered--high performance cars, the big Mercedes-sourced van, and (interestingly) diesels, plus some fleet vehicles.I think the diesel drivetrains already come with some type of extended warranty, and since they are used for some very high mile applications (2-300k/yr) that might be too much to ask. I think its cool that they would be willing to support a single owner for a 150-200k lifetime. If the warranty covers the transmission and basic engine mechanicals (like the oil pump, head gasket, etc, but not the water pump), I think that would make me feel more comfortable with a vehicle.I also think since most people lease the car anyway, the exposure for Chrysler is minimal, and they might actually be making a reliable product :P  If you\\'d pay attention you\\'d see that Ford isn\\'t just cost cutting their way to profit, they\\'re making fundamental changes to how they do business including better products but it won\\'t happen overnight. One profitable quarter is simply a good sign that they\\'re on the right path. We\\'ll know in 4 years when the clean sheet new products arrive.I bet if Honda or Toyota came out with a similar warranty it would be praised as evidence of superior quality. Neither position is accurate as warranty length has nothing to do with quality - it\\'s just an insurance policy with a defined cost that has to be built into the product. Higher quality means less warranty cost but you can put a 10 yr warranty on anything if you have enough profit to pay for the repairs.  Exactly. It\\'s not much of a risk for Chrysler because many people lease cars for a short time, and the average time of ownership of a car is just a few years (one article about this warranty quoted someone at Chrysler as saying 3 years). But it does really stand out as something unique in the industry, and therefore is a smart step for Chrysler, which is desparate to attract buyers any way they can. Then they have to hope that the curious people who come in to drive a Sebring or Avenger like the car enough to buy or lease it.One little problem I see with this warranty program: when Hyundai did it eight years ago, they had a big problem with lack of confidence in the quality of their vehicles. A long warranty can help alleviate that concern. I don\\'t think Chrysler\\'s big problem is vehicle reliability, at least not powertrain reliability. I think it\\'s that they need more competitive car designs, especially mid-sized cars (and small cars too). A long warranty won\\'t help solve that problem, but maybe it will help them stay in the game better until they can improve their cars.  Well there are a few oddballs like me that buy a car new and keep it forever. Had our first two new cars for 12 years each and our 3rd for 10 and counting. Plan to keep the latest ones just as long.Most people in both our families are the same way and I expect our kids will be so also, so for us it would be a factor. OTOH, from the mfr\\'s perspective, if all you attract are the buyers who come in once every 12 years (like me) you will only sell them 1/4 as many cars as you would to the same number of people who trade every 3 years. :surprise: I would have liked to have had a warranty like this on my windstar to cover all the gaskets in their sieve (3.8L engine). And actually, now that I think of it, it was seals and gaskets that led to the demise of it\\'s predecessor...a Plymouth minivan.I think this would have caused me to give additional consideration to Chyrsler products, but pretty sure even after that I would not have chosen the Sebring.  I tend to keep new cars in the family for a long time also, but I don\\'t put many miles on in a year. That is why the long warranties from Hyundai et. al. appeal to me. However, the warranty is no good to me if I don\\'t like the car. The warranty is a tie-breaker for me, if more than one car crosses the bar in every other respect. The Sebring and Avenger don\\'t do that for me. But suppose it came down to, say, an Optima and a Milan, for about the same price. Then the Optima\\'s longer warranty would be a plus.  If someone was already considering a Chrysler product, this could cinch the deal. This warranty should help Chrysler retain/maintain the current number of customers, but as far as attracting more/new customers, I doubt it will be so effective.  Ford\\'s first profitable\\' quarter in a long long timeeven ford themselves said it would be the only profitable quarter this year, and they don\\'t expect sustained profitablilty till 2009  But it sure helps with the cash flow situation.  It also shocked a lot of so called financial \"experts\". :shades: This article appeared in the Detroit News the morning of the 26th. They should have waited to publish their guesses.

Camcords have the warranties that they have precisely and only  because that is all that is needed to sell them - some of the cars in this group don\\'t get a second look without it - and it would be foolish (and bad business) for Toyota/Honda (and Nissan) to do such a thing when all three cars sell just fine and magically blow away the lesser competition in long term reliability studies anyway. In short, these extended warranties are more likely evidence of suspect quality (and reputation) not superior.The Camcords, specifically, have set the standard in this class for about 25 years now, and there is no evidence at this point that any of this has changed other than the competition seems, over a much shorter term, to be getting a bit better. It\\'s about time - it is not like those other manufacturers didn\\'t have plenty of time to see how it\\'s done...These warranties are offered for several marketing type reasons, but \\'superior quality\\' is NOT one of them. \\'Superior quality\\' is something that is expected from models from particular mfgrs., and not something that any warranty of any length is ever going to imply/evidence/guarantee (or whatever), for 10 years or 10 minutes!From your statement you are trying to tell me that the Sebring, in this case, must be the best built car available, if we are to assume that this model is covered by this Chrysler warranty? Gimme a break!  We\\'ll know in 4 years when the clean sheet new products arrive. oh yeah, more promises coming from Dearborn. Both the Fusion and Five Hundred were touted to be class competitive and defining \\'clean sheet\\' new products, neither of which are or were. How about some results - the promises are getting very, very, very, old.  We\\'ll know in 4 years when the clean sheet new products arrive. I believe what the captain meant to say was:oh yeah, more promises coming from Dearborn. Both the Fusion and Five Hundred were touted to be class competitive and defining \\'clean sheet\\' new productsINSERT PERSONAL OPINION HEREI think there is a slight mix up between class competitive and class leading. Of course, I don\\'t think an over powered weak kneed lounge chair is class leading either, and that seemed to drive his purchase decision.  From your statement you are trying to tell me that the Sebring, in this case, must be the best built car available, if we are to assume that this model is covered by this Chrysler warranty? Gimme a break!Please re-read what I posted. I guess you stopped after the first sentence.I bet if Honda or Toyota came out with a similar warranty it would be praised as evidence of superior quality. Neither position is accurate as warranty length has nothing to do with quality - it\\'s just an insurance policy with a defined cost that has to be built into the product. Higher quality means less warranty cost but you can put a 10 yr warranty on anything if you have enough profit to pay for the repairs.My point was the Camcord lovers have such a double standard on things like this that it\\'s almost laughable.  oh yeah, more promises coming from Dearborn. Both the Fusion and Five Hundred were touted to be class competitive and defining \\'clean sheet\\' new products, neither of which are or were. How about some results - the promises are getting very, very, very, old.The Fusion and the Five Hundred ARE competitive - not class leading but certainly competitive. The new Taurus just might be class leading.There are 2 things different at Ford - Fields and Mullaly - and they are making FUNDAMENTAL changes to how Ford designs and builds cars (finally) that previous CEOs either didn\\'t know how or didn\\'t have the guts to do. The 09 models due out next year will be the first real sign of the product design turnaround under Fields. It will take 2 or 3 more years to fully realize the global platform strategy that Mullaly is mandating now.  \"Five Hundred ARE competitive\"I agree 100%. I had a 500 for a week, it had a lot of room. Amenities were ok. Acceleration was adequate, handline was annoying and it sucked gas like no tomorrow. Would I buy one over an Accord? I don\\'t know, this car defintely fits the value proposition, pay less, get less.  \" let the Kia haters begin the tirades... \"I for one actually like the new Optima. From what I have seen and read, it is a big step up for that manufacturer.  I fail to see how a package of extended warranties e.g: Hyundai\\'s 10 yr/100K mile powertrain coupled with a 5 yr/60K mile bumper to bumper + additional perks is \"ridiculous\". I have found through experience that Hyundai doesn\\'t \"need\" this type of warranty any longer to sell cars. In fact I keep looking for them to drop/diminish it. However, please don\\'t make the mistake of believing that Honda (for sure in my experience), and Toyota don\\'t need the reassurance of a long warranty. I do have experiences (not good ones) with a 2006 Civic and keep looking over my shoulder at the end of the 3 yrs/36K mile warranty rapidly closing in on us. I for one like AND miss the luxury of a long warranty...used or not.  no, I said what I meant to and did start that particular post with an IMO - the 500 a regurgitated Volvo, the Fusion, of course a regurgitated 6 and both hampered by old drivetrains that simply don\\'t measure up by about any yardstick you choose to use - power and FE come to mind. Even the new Edge, portrayed recently in a magazine as something that could have \\'saved Ford\\' has tested very poorly (CR) relative to its competition despite getting the new \\'clean sheet\\' 3.5 which apparently isn\\'t really \\'clean sheet\\' after all. Yes, class leading and competitive are certainly different terms, but, it would be refreshing to see any Detriot mfgr. make something other than a truck that would cause the real Big 3 in this class to take notice.The Avalon, BTW, which I guess is what you diss, is anything but \\'weak kneed\\' in the \\'Touring\\' trim which I own, has further won outright every comparo it has ever been a part of (TMK), has the lowest COO in its class, the best power (except for the V8s, of course), the best FE, and is the highest rated sedan CR has ever tested (tied with an Acura). If you are willing to tradeoff some of smooth and quiet ride for anything not so \\'soft\\' that\\'s one thing but that, my friend, is exactly what \\'class leading\\' is all about!  My point was the Camcord lovers have such a double standard on things like this that it\\'s almost laughable. Yes, some of them would.cough andres3 cough, cough :P  I have found through experience that Hyundai doesn\\'t \"need\" this type of warranty any longer to sell cars.glad you\\'ve had apparently good luck with your Hyundais, but it would be the Korean mfgrs. that \\'need\\' that warranty the most, IMO, not so much for what they are producing now but in payment for past sins. No car should have any sort of real problems in its first 100k, the warranties \\'ridiculous\\' (maybe a bad choice of words) in that a well designed and built car shouldn\\'t ever darken the dealer\\'s doorstep until well after that mileage has come and gone. In fact, I would bet that the 7 years (for those that don\\'t drive that much, is a tougher number (from Hyundai\\'s perspective) than the 100k. Tell me that your Hyundai has been trouble free for several years and maybe 250k miles, that\\'s indicative of something really good as it is for any car these days.  >Hogwash, IMO - if you find Toyota or Honda offering these ridiculous warranties then it is evidence of declining market share or (even worse) declining reputation.How about the transmission \"extension warranty\" to 100K miles for Hondas. How about the recalls to put in an oiling tube they \"forgot\" in engineering?How about the current transmission/powertrain problems with flare and hesitations in Camry (ES/Avalon), which is giving Camry a real problem in image. If you are open-minded I can link to discussions here on Edmunds where people are upset about not having the \"powertrain warranty\" applied even during those short full warranty periods. How about the recent sludge problem with Toyotas? They extended the warranty to cover some--at least to make it look good in the media...Regression to the mean is occurring.  Or it could be some people will love a lovable car.Just a thought,LorenP.S. on the serious side, all cars need as long a warranty as possible, as anything mechanical can need to be repaired. In the case of some cars, more often than not.As for Hyundai, they got some good cars. Tested the Sonata and it seemed good. Trouble for Hyundai with this group is that there are other great choices. Good doesn\\'t trump great.  Granted, the Camcords have a good track record in the USA, but marketing and consumer perception plays an enormous part in the determination of quality. Kia, which is perceived as a cheap, unreliable brand in the USA, is well-accepted in Europe.  you buy your kid a high mileage Camcord or Civic/Corolla and that is thought to be a wise decision, do the same thing with a Kia (and many other varieties) and folks think you are crazy - perception, for sure - but also one with about 20 years of history behind it.  guy1974 wrote this in Satun forum: To soften the blow Saturn have upto $2250 of rebates/incentives on the 07 Aura to help shift the backlog. Where do I get $2,250 of rebates/incentives! I just talked to the dealership and they acted like I was nuts. They said the only thing they\\'d give me is $500 for some conquest incentive because I\\'m trading in another car. $500 is crap. Tell me how to get the other $1750 and I\\'ll buy the Aura today, otherwise I\\'ll have to wait and upgrade to another Accord or maybe buy the \\'08 Malibu. I just don\\'t understand why Saturn doesn\\'t deal. No wonder they\\'ve only sold 9 of 128 Aura\\'s over the past 3 weeks. That\\'s right, they had 128 Aura\\'s on thier lot on the 9th of this month. I don\\'t know how they stay in business without turning inventory. The longer something sits, the worse off they are, no?  Wonder why buying a high mileage foreign car is considered a wise decision? Seems to me like a costly repair bill would be lurking in the future. I would think the domestics would cost less to repair and be less expensive to insure. On the other hand, buying a used Kia or Hyundai seems like not so wise a move. Yeah, I would buy a used Japan make first. The Kia / Hyundai needs to be backed by the original owner warranty, thus bought new and held for ten years to pay out.My Dad knew a traveling salesman that bought high mileage Civic, drove them another 50K to 100K then dumped it and bought another one. Well it could work out. To buy a kid one, with the chance of it breaking, with a higher insurance rate makes little sense to me.Loren  I agree. anything over 150k miles is a crap shoot at best. If it was properly and professionally maintained it might go another 100k. But then again, it might not. Unless it was being had real cheap, doesn\\'t really make a lot of sense.  Your information is all nice and dandy, but I get annoyed, suspicious, and rightfully angry when Insurance Agents (not all agents/companies, but definitely some) ask me the following question when I\\'m asking to get a quote:Is your 2.0L Turbo Audi A3 a Sport or Premium version?They are the exact same car, only the Sport has a \"sport\" suspension, and high performance summer tires vs. the Premium\\'s all-season performance tires. Cost wise, they were virtually identical in MSRP in 2006; so I ask you..... why the question?I understand the need to differentiate between the 3.2 Quattro V6 and the 2.0T 4 cylinder in the A3, but not the Sport vs. Premium.  :lemon: I disagree. I think Chrysler\\'s biggest problem is having produced nothing but :lemon: \\'s in their long history. My experience with them and from people I know is that they have produced about as many non-lemons in their entire corporate history as Yugo produced cars in the US period.Either way, the biggest problem is that everyone knows Chryslers have terrible reliability, including the powertrains, and that leads to terrible resale value since they don\\'t last much past 50K miles.Since the warranty doesn\\'t transfer, the resale value (one key problem) is not helped one bit! SHAME on Chrysler!Plus, they won\\'t exist in 10 years anyway, so the warranty won\\'t be worth the paper it\\'s written on.  My point was the Camcord lovers have such a double standard on things like this that it\\'s almost laughable. Funny, I don\\'t think anyone became a Camcord lover at first sight. I think they all fell in love after one or more ownership experiences over years. It was a slow love affair. :blush: I don\\'t think anyone hated the Big 3 in the US at first sight, but after an ownership experience, they were ready to kill them in hatred. :mad:  I don\\'t think anyone hated the Big 3 in the US at first sight, but after an ownership experience, they were ready to kill them in hatred.Only because they stopped making my beloved Contour   If it\\'s a crapshoot then betting on Honda must be like taking 1-11 and betting on Chrysler must be like taking 12 and only 12......I would buy any 150K Honda that still drives like it should (and is supposed to) in a second! Risk of expensive repair..... nil.... Risk of cheap repairs..... some... but not much...  I\\'m not too impressed by the warranty either. It is a gimmick unless you plan to keep the car for along time. Chrysler is banking on what Hyundai did with their warranty in counting on buyers to buy their cars and keep them a few years, and then sell them to void the longterm warranty. Thats what most people do with the auto industry average still about 5-years before trade in.  Reviewing my friends that have owned Chrysler products, all have had reasonable luck, even though most never adhered to a routine maintenance program, and that includes oil changes. I recently sold our 1994 Grand Caravan with the 3.3L V6 and 4-speed automatic that we purchased new in late 1994. After 170K miles, the engine was only using about a quarter of a quart of oil between changes (3K or 3 months), and it had the ORIGINAL 4-speed automatic, and it still shifted fine. I used Mobil 1 synthetic, and change ATF every 24k. During trips it would deliver 26MPG with a full load of family and luggage. Many purported economy cars today don\\'t do too much better.I really believe that much of the poor reliability with any car relates to extremely poor preventive/routine maintenance by the owner.As to Chrysler\\'s new Lifetime Power Train warranty - I believe it may be a tactic of the new private equity firm owner (Cerebus) to improve sales in the short term (3 to 5 years) to bolster the stock price, and then they will dump Chrysler at a decent profit. After all, that\\'s what private equity firms generally do!  they won\\'t exist in 10 years anyway, so the warranty won\\'t be worth the paper it\\'s written on. as much as I might agree with you on the quality comments, and the forbodding \\'purchase\\' by Cerebus might support this, remember that it was Chrysler that required all those loans on the last \\'bail-out\\' several years back and it was the K car, the minivans, and the SUVs/trucks combined with some lower gas prices that allowed Chrysler to pay everything back with interest - early. It may be a little early to declare C, Ford, or GM dead. It would be generally devastating to this country if this would happen to any of the three, in any case.I\\'ve always thought that Chrysler had a penchant for one thing - styling - but also that their products were crappola otherwise. A Sebring (or 300) in my driveway, not a chance, warranties notwithstanding - more like I wouldn\\'t want to have to deal with what I would anticipate being the aggravation of ever owning one - who is actually paying for those repairs being secondary!  I\\'m wondering how much Chrysler is going to charge people for their mandatory drivetrain checkups every 5 years. It would probably add up to the cost of an extended warranty, at least.  I would buy any 150K Honda that still drives like it should (and is supposed to) in a second! Risk of expensive repair..... nil.... Risk of cheap repairs..... some... but not much...I guess \"expensive\" repair is relative. I have a \\'96 Accord LX (Auto, I4) that currently has 174k. It drives nicely, if a little floaty (I\\'ll need shocks soon). My last repair was $564 for a new radiator - 172,000 miles. Before that, a new brake master-cylinder, which was about $310 - 160,000 miles. Before that, the main cooling fan motor went at somewhere around 140k-150k miles (the actual mileage is escaping me at the moment). That was $350 or so. For a car worth $4,000 or less, I\\'ve spent $1,100+ not including brakes/tires/gas/oil changes/body repairs since I\\'ve had the car. Sure, some cars will cost you that before you hit 100,000 miles, but life isn\\'t perfect on the north side of 150k either. To its credit, I have entirely original exhaust system, alternator, fuel pump, and transmission, things that often are shot by this point in a car\\'s life.(By the way, I got the car in Aug. 2002, when it had 121,000 miles on it = 5 years and 53,000 miles under my ownership).  Those are all cheap repairs in my opinion. An expensive repair is one that costs more than $500. So your new radiator is borderline, and that happened at 172K miles. In my domestic it seemed almost every repair ended up leading to at least 2 issues to be repaired; which ended up always costing $400 or more (WITH MANY BEING $1,000 OR MORE) way back in the late nineties. With inflation I\\'d say the figure should be $500 now.  thats the whole reason I wouldn\\'t buy a car with over 150k miles one it. You can go ahead and take your chances andres, but there is no part on any car that will last forever. those asian cars that run problem free for over 100k miles can quickly begin to nickle and dime you to death. Sure, the engine will continue to run fine, but with so many miles on original parts, the odds of having to fix something are far to great for me.Now if the car is cheap enough, thats a different story.I\\'ll give you an example. My 98 200sx with 147k miles and 9 years old has everything on it original. with the sole exception of the front brakes and the battery. that leaves the rear brakes, altenator, starter, power motors for the windows, and moon roof, distributor, water pump, radiator, clutch, exhaust...........i could continue, but you get the point.........with a lot of age and miles on them. I\\'m not expecting it to, but with so much original equipment that thing could easily turn into a repair nightmare (or mechanics dream depending on your POV :P ). I think its the one way the reliability of asian cars can come back and bite you in the [non-permissible content removed]. It could very easily turn into fix something every 3 months. nothing on its own major or expensive, but enough of them and it starts to add up.  I guess \"expensive\" repair is relative. I have a \\'96 Accord LX (Auto, I4) that currently has 174k. It drives nicely, if a little floaty (I\\'ll need shocks soon). My last repair was $564 for a new radiator - 172,000 miles. Before that, a new brake master-cylinder, which was about $310 - 160,000 miles. Before that, the main cooling fan motor went at somewhere around 140k-150k miles (the actual mileage is escaping me at the moment). That was $350 or so. Relative! You can say that again. There are some outrageous charges here. Dealerships charge way too much, IMO. I guess the charge for the radiator is not too bad, but $310 for a MC, and $350 for a fan motor. That\\'s highway robbery.  \"Virtually\" identical price may be the key. Price range is considered. In distunguishing from one price range to another, a line is drawn (i.e. 1 to 1,000 vs 1001 to 2000). There\\'s not much difference between 995 and 1004, but if the line is drawn at 1,000 there will be a difference. I just checked the ISO rating symbols and saw that a 2006 Audi A3 \"sport\" or \"premium\" have the same rating symbol--18. The question about trim is probably a standard question that must be answered in a computerized rating/quoting system and has nothing to due with the name a manufacturer slaps on a car for marketing purposes. Do you really think that a Dodge Caravan \"Sport\" is \"sporty?\"Insurance companies have been working toward providing the most accurate quotes possible so there won\\'t be any unpleasant surprizes at the time of purchase. To improve accuracy they need more detailed information than they needed a few years ago. Why does that make you \"annoyed, suspicious, and rightfully angry?\" Do you get angry about other questions they ask, some of which may lead to discounts?  You know what you have got into it, and its paid for, so you might as well keep it if its not boaring you.  According to what I have read, there is no charge for the inspection. I still would be leary of the fine print and what maintenance they expect you to perform and where. Other than the Viper, Chrysler cars don\\'t do anything for me but to each his own.  agreed. thats why I kept it when I bought my altima instead of tradding it in. But, I\\'d never buy one like it. at least that high of mileage and that age because of the reasons I mentioned. Not unless I was getting it for a steal.  And, if you can believe it, this dealership is the cheap one in town!Labor is $70/hrSheesh.At least they stand behind their work (its been proven over and over with my family).It\\'s time for the timing belt soon, and I\\'ll be having it done at a local mechanic my grandfather uses; his quote from the dealer for a change of all belts (timing belt included) and water pump was about $250 less at the mechanic than the dealership.  You know what you have got into it, and its paid for, so you might as well keep it if its not boaring you. That\\'s the other side of the issue. It is a known entity. It has been treated well for its whole life, and it is worth more to us keeping it in the \"fleet\" of family vehicles than the cash from the sale of it would be.It is my family\\'s \"extra\" car. We are so used to having it, that if we got rid of it, we\\'d have to get another one, and that would cost more than the cost of keeping this one running (which is about $300 a year + oil changes + gas + cheap insurance). Also, my vehicle is my 2006 Accord (i drive both regularly though), but since we have the 1996 in the fleet, I\\'m insured as the primary on the \\'96, and my mom is \"Primary\" on the 2006. Saves us money in a roundabout way.  Try $85 an hour in California! I do know of one mechanic which will do some basic work for $45 an hour. But some things have to be done at the dealership or somewhere they are all the equipment for the task at hand. Dollar wise, I think a doctor charges about the same as these dealerships do per hour Loren  Well, I can\\'t report 250K miles (which I think is excessive to expect even in this day of an easy 100K car) on our 2000 Elantra, an early enough model that apparently doesn\\'t qualify as one of the \"greatly improved\" products Hyundai builds these days (built in the \"bad old days\" for Hyundai). But, its quality is good enough to have traveled 161.5K miles with only an alternator/battery replacement. Sure...tires, brake parts etc have been replaced. My son drives this car 100 miles per day and since he is in Chicago for a week I have been driving it. It has been some time since I have had the opportunity to do so and I am amazed at how well it runs..drives. Still like new and I didn\\'t have any fear taking it on a 300 mile trip last week-end. So, one man\\'s tale with a 7 year/161K mile old Hyundai.  for me to plug the new Dealer Ratings & Reviews feature again. Several of you are making comments about service experiences that would be helpful to share with the world.  So why do Insurance Companies use retarded things like \"ranges\" when they should be using \"ratios\" to be more exact and accurate.A 19,001 dollar car should not cost that much more to insure than a 18,999 dollar one (if they are otherwise virtually identical). To be honest, fair and ethical, shouldn\\'t insurance companies stop using ranges like 12-15,000 miles, and start using mathematical ratios to figure out that the difference between 12,000 and 15,000 miles driven per year is significant, but the difference between 11,950 and 12,050 miles/year is less than 1%?  I\\'ve never had my insurance rate change because of the number of miles driven. What insurance companies do you deal with, or are you just very young (under 25)?  $70 to $100 seems to be the typical hourly service rate at dealerships, unless you own an exotic. My dealer charges $90 an hour - and, I\\'m in Illinois.  I remember reading a few months back that the Mazda6 was one of the least costly to insure compared to other cars in this class. Part of the reason, I would think, would have to do with the a relatively low cost to repair to the bumpers and the rest of the car compared to other cars in this class according to the study done by the insurance companies. And perhaps another part may be that better handling cars will have a better chance at avoiding an accident. Of course using this logic, a sports car would have very low insurance rates, which they don\\'t, so maybe this theory shouldn\\'t be emphasized too much, but I\\'m not sure what else would explain the differences... maybe the mazda6 looks so nice, other cars don\\'t want to hit it? :shades:  Price ranges are the starting point for physical damage insurance; the line has to be drawn somewhere, just like a city or state boundary line, or voting district boundary lines. Live on one side of the line and you\\'re in a different category than w neighbor who lives on the other side of the line.After the price range starting point other factors are considered such as frequency of claims and damagability. It\\'s not an everyday happen stance, but it\\'s not unusual for a more expensive car, whether a couple bucks more expensive or even a few thousand bucks more, to have a lower rating symbol than a lower prices car. Regarding you annual mileage concern: I\\'m not familiar with that as none of the companies I represent use that criterion. But, again, for those companies that do, a line has to be drawn somewhere. The system is not individualized but is based on large numbers. If it were individualized and you had a somewhat serious accident, you might never be able to afford car insurance again and without insurance you might not be able to register a car or drive.   And perhaps another part may be that better handling cars will have a better chance at avoiding an accident. The handling differences are not that great. So that statement is about as likely as this one. maybe the mazda6 looks so nice, other cars don\\'t want to hit it?It\\'s all about the cost to repair. It costs less to buy, costs less to repair, and therefore costs less to insure. Makes sense huh?   Elroy, you\\'re on the right track, but the car that is less expensive to buy is not necessarily the less espensive to repair after an accident.  On average, I\\'d say it\\'s true. If you crash a Buick, and a Benz into a wall at 20mph, the Benz will likely cost more to repair, even if it has a little less damage. \"Crumple zones\" are meant to protect passengers, but it doesn\\'t bode well for the crumpled car, when the repair costs are added up.  It\\'s all about the cost to repair. It costs less to buy, costs less to repair, and therefore costs less to insure. Makes sense huh?If only things were that simple as that kind of logic...actually, as bhmr59 mentioned, there is not a big correlation between the cost of a car vs the cost to repair a car. In the IIHS study that tested most of the midsize cars, the Sonata in a full frontal fender bender cost 4 times more to repair than the Mazda6! And the Altima cost nearly 3 times more in a rear fender bender in comparison to the Mazda6 (probably because the Altima has those huge faux crystals on the back that they call taillights). And the accord cost 3.5 times more to repair a front frender bender than the Mazda6. Of course deductables make these costs not as significant to the owner, but this would help to understand why the Mazda6 was found to be one of the least expensive to insure in the midsize class. The handling differences are not that great. Tell that to the girl in the passenger seat of a bmw that made a sudden left hand turn into my lane a couple weeks ago... going by the test results by many car mags, if I were driving an Accord or Altima, I would have not been able to stop in time and that girl would have a few reasons to be very unhappy. Oh, and the latest poll clearly found that when given a choice, people prefer to not hit good looking cars, especially the Mazda6 :P  ...with an A/T that has a above average fuel economy and has descent power. I understand the new Altima fits these requirements. Consumer Reports says the 2.5 S Altima goes 0-60 in 8.0 seconds and it does better at the pump than the 4 cyl Camry or Accord. So the 07 Altima 2.5 S has better fuel economy AND has more power!Also the Sentra SE-R has a 2.5l engine and, under the governments new ratings, does better at the pump than the Altima! Consumer Reports had nothing on 0-60 time on the SE-R. Seems the Spec V is more popular and gets more press.Comments or advice appreciated.  Well, as an Accord owner that hasn\\'t driven the 2007 Altima (so keep that in mind and take what I say with a grain of salt) let me say that I am more than happy with the economy my Accord gives me. I\\'ve gotten above 35 MPG on every single highway-only trip I\\'ve taken (and I drive between 70-80 MPH typically). In mixed suburban driving, 28-30 MPG is typical for me.It is also plenty quick, although I believe testing shows the Altima to be faster.Go drive them and form your own opinions. Accords can be had well below invoice at this point, and in-turn, may give you more bang for your buck.The best advice I can give is to drive as many vehicles as you can before making a decision.   Based on the things you\\'ve said so far, you want something both fun and frugal with an automatic. It also sounds like you don\\'t mind a slightly smaller car so long as it has 4 doors (which is why you\\'d consider the sentra). Some questions I would ask before making a recommendation would include...1 - would you like to be able to haul somewhat larger items without having to borrow a pickup or SUV? in other words, would a hatchback or wagon be desireable as long as it looked ok?2 - how much do you like to drive? do you like twisty roads or do you just want enough power to get past the slowpokes? or is a car just a way to get from a to b? 3 - how long do you think you\\'ll keep the car? will the length of standard warranty be a factor for you?4 - if you could save money on the car purchase, would gas mileage be as important (think of the savings on buying the car as a gas allowance...)?or if you don\\'t want to think that much, the Altima would be a good choice as long as you can get used to the funky transmission. the Accord is always a good, although a bit too common, choice. and of course the Mazda6 (yes I\\'m biased...that\\'s what I have) will be fun to drive in the twisties and will have the option of the hatchback which looks like a sedan but can store/ haul big things. The 4 banger automatic is a bit slow though...but you can get it in some markets for 6k+ off of msrp. The Sonata would be another choice that could be described as \"practical\" and \"value oriented.\"In the end though, grad is right...drive many of the cars, and don\\'t make a decision too quickly. and never let a saleperson know that you really really like their car!!! always say it\\'s nice, but so was the other car (insert name here). and don\\'t drive a car that you can\\'t afford or don\\'t really want (like a 2 door coupe)... you may make a decision you would regret later. You\\'ll find many opinions here, so if that\\'s what you want, you\\'ve come to the right place!  Elroy, you\\'re on the right track, but the car that is less expensive to buy is not necessarily the less espensive to repair after an accident.My Mazda6 S was roughly $20 less to insure per year than our \\'96 Civic was. Go figure! The 6 did cost about $4000 more to buy too. That was with Allstate. We\\'ve since switched to State Farm and they are only charging me $40 more per year to insure a 2006 Mustang GT over the Mazda6 it replaced. The Mustang cost $9000 more than the 6 to buy(after rebates and all on the 6 which I factored into the difference from the Civic above too).The 6 was leased though so I\\'m not sure that that had anything to do with it. I do know that we didn\\'t change any coverage levels when we replaced it with the Mustang though.  None of these cars have \"above average\" fuel economy, and I wouldn\\'t make the final decision over 1 mpg anyway. Have you considered the Camry hybrid? There are people who rave about it, but I\\'ll take performance over gas mileage.The Accord is as good as it gets. The 2008 is around the corner, but don\\'t expect any deals. You could probably make out like a bandit with a 2007 though. The Sentra is not as roomy as the Accord. How long do you want to keep the car? A car that may seem fine for a year, you may come to hate over the long haul.Need to decide how much room you will need and what you in general want to use the car for.Good luck.  Insurance is funny. I replaced a Jeep with a BMW and my insurance went down significantly. I know the insurance knows why, but I sure don\\'t, nor did I ask.  I know the insurance knows why, but I sure don\\'t, nor did I ask. That\\'s kind of what I was getting at. I thought I was going to get nailed on the insurance when I bought the Mustang but was pleasantly surprised and did not question that one either.  Also the Sentra SE-R has a 2.5l engine and, under the governments new ratings, does better at the pump than the Altima! Consumer Reports had nothing on 0-60 time on the SE-R. Seems the Spec V is more popular and gets more press.The SE-R is a regular Sentra with a body kit and the engine from the Altima. The SpecV is a sport sedan with a 6 speed manual that competes with the Civic SI.It does better at the pump because it is smaller and marginally lighter.  going by the test results by many car mags, if I were driving an Accord or Altima, I would have not been able to stop in timeprobably a very difficult thing to know for sure simply because I doubt very seriously that you know how much distance exactly it took you to stop or even whether that distance was the best your particular car could do. Maybe I need some references here, but 60-0 tests I\\'ve read show the Mazda6/Fusion at a smidge over 130 feet (the longest stopping distances in this group), where the other cars you mention test at several feet LESS. In any case, I would suggest that any difference, better or worse, within let\\'s say 10 feet or so is insignificant given the influences of driver reaction time, road and tire type and conditions etc. Kinda like a high speed accelerating swerve I pulled off awhile back - that has me sold on the benefits of the \\'excessive\\' power I have and has further convinced me that I may not be here today if my car had happened to be ESC equipped - I have no way to KNOW that I couldn\\'t have done the same thing sans the extra HP and with the stability control interference.  \"I know the insurance knows why, but I sure don\\'t, nor did I ask.\"When I got the 1991 Mazda 626, the insurance company ran the VIN number and it came back as a two-door... and they wanted to charge a considerably higher rate just because it was showing up in their system as a coupe.There were very minor differences between the 4-door and the 2-door... same engine choices, transmissions, etc. They even used the same frame. One was not considerably larger, costlier, faster, or safer than the other. The single biggest difference between the two was the body style. Mazda just decided to call the 4-door the 626 and the 2-door the MX-6.We had to actually drive the car to the local insurance office so that they could see it in person to verify that it was, in fact, a sedan and not a coupe.  \"...would you like to be able to haul somewhat larger items without having to borrow a pickup or SUV? in other words, would a hatchback or wagon be desireable as long as it looked ok?\" So far in the 6 months I\\'ve owned my Accord, I\\'ve had it filled to capacity several times, with anything from luggage and passengers, to bicycles and gear, to 10-foot peices of moulding (inside the car!), to old rotting lumber. I\\'ve never missed my previous SUV.However, I think you are onto something about the larger (midsize) hatchbacks like the Mazda6. Well, there aren\\'t many others are there? I don\\'t know why this isn\\'t a more popular choice today. Standing and looking at my sedan, there is a lot of wasted space in the design of the cargo area, specifically the differences between a sedan and a hatchback. What is the value of having a fixed rear \"parcel shelf\" which basically just holds the rear speakers? All I can think of is traditional sedan styling, and perhaps the security of being able to lock items into a closed trunk.While I\\'ve been happy so far with the volume and variety of my cargo capacity, incorporating the back glass into a larger, roof-hinged trunk door and eliminating that \"parcel shelf\" would allow more room and much easier access. I\\'m sold on the hatchback idea if it is executed well like the Mazda6.  Your point is valid. When the mags proclaim x car stops in 115 feet and y car stops in 130 feet, this is a sample size of 1. Actual stopping distances may vary due to terrain, car load, condition of brakes, road conditions, tire conditions, etc. I wouldn\\'t bet my life on that 15 feet.It is useful to know in general the mags think x car stops shorter than y car, but that\\'s where it ends. I wouldn\\'t make a purchase decision on 15 feet.  Simply upgrading the brake pads can make a huge difference. My last ride was a 4,400-lb SUV with an appetite for pads and especially rotors. For the third replacement, out of warranty this time, I upgraded to a set of ceramic pads. After breaking them in a bit, I pointed the truck down a hill and stood suddenly on the brake pedal. The difference in braking power over the previous sets of stock pads was astounding to me. I don\\'t have numbers, just seat-of-the-pants feel. When I showed my wife, she was amazed as well. My heavy truck had become one of the best-braking vehicles I\\'ve owned. When it\\'s time for pads on my car, I\\'m going to look into an upgrade this time as well.Sure, they cost a bit more and probably won\\'t last quite as long, but if you are concerned about stopping power, this is the way to go. Those ceramic pads also didn\\'t produce nearly as much brake dust, and my mechanic said they are actually better on the rotors.  None of these cars have \"above average\" fuel economy, and I wouldn\\'t make the final decision over 1 mpg anyway.I agree.For these cars in 4 cylinder versions, 1 mpg saves about $400 in 100,000 miles. That would mean $40-80 per year for most people, based on 10,000-20,000 miles per year. I think in CR tests almost every 4 cyl is within maybe 2 mpg of every other. So in most cases you are talking about a difference of $80-160. For me this is not enough difference to have any significant impact on my car choice. Anyway, the differences in purchase price can be more than enough to make up for any mpg deficiency, in some cases. I believe I would have had to pay $3000-4000 more to buy an Altima or Accord, rather than my Mazda6. If fuel costs me $800 more over the first 100,000 miles, I am still way ahead. As always, the calculus is different for frequent traders.  IMO a lot of evaluations of braking performance is somewhat subjective anyway - meaning how \\'hard\\' and \\'linear\\' the brake pedal feels. My Toyota has a decidedly mushier feel to it than my Altima, for example, but they both stop in about the same distance.  The Mazda6 seems to have an advantage in breaking in the comparison test done by Edmonds (I prefer to use comparison tests since the results are gathered from the same track on the same day which controls for weather differences). The Accord took 133.4 feet to stop, the Altima (previous gen) took 137.3 feet and the Mazda6 took 123.5 feet to stop from 60 to 0. If I remember correctly, most of the other comparo\\'s had similar #\\'s with the mazda6 doing quite well compared to it\\'s peers in braking distances.  The Mazda6 seems to have an advantage in breaking... Now that\\'s an odd thing to call an advantage  .  But why does their have to be a large dividing line? Why can\\'t simple mathematical ratios be used?Multiply a factor (say .001 or whatever) by the amount of miles driven or any other criteria like the cost of the vehicle (.001 x 20,000 to come up with some \"cost.\" You could do this for everything... that way 19,999 dollars won\\'t differentiate more than it should from 20,001 dollars.  and this may all be true, although it was MT that listed both the Fusion and 6 at 131 feet. As kdshapiro noted \\'a sample size of 1\\' that probably makes no allowances for driver to driver differences as well. I guarantee you that I could get a car to stop in shorter distances when I was 20 years old, then I can now simply because I would imagine my reaction times have aged as much as I have. Nobody said that the 6 had \\'bad\\' (or especially good) brakes, only that it is a stretch to assume that any car will avoid an accident when a different car wouldn\\'t, when what we are really talking about about a lousy 10 feet or so of \\'tested\\' braking distances - which BTW translates to 1/8 of a second of reaction time at 60 mph.. While a good set of brakes is probably #1 on my list of REAL (and useful) active safety features, it is still only a part of what makes a dynamically \\'safer\\' car, those other parts being power and handling. The trick, of course, being able to avoid an accident so that you don\\'t end up with 538 airbags giving you chemical burns....  although it was MT that listed both the Fusion and 6 at 131 feet. .Do you have a link for that captain? When I checked MT\\'s site I found their test of a 2004 V6 Mazda6 and it did 60-0 in 127 feet.My experience with my former 6 agrees with what zzzoom is saying. It stopped hard and fast and did save my butt a couple of times. Once from an idiot and once from a deer on a highway. Both were panic stops where the brake pedal went as far as I could push it and the ABS didn\\'t even have to kick on either time. The only time I experienced ABS in that car was in the snow or when braking going down a hill and hitting a pothole or bump in the road if anyone knows how that goes.  you miss the point - your 4 feet, if indeed that is the case, is inconsequential - a Camcordima driver can properly say that his brakes \\'saved his butt\\' quite correctly, that is what brakes are for! I would further suggest that if you don\\'t get your ABS to kick in on what you regard as a \\'panic\\' stop then either the ABS isn\\'t working right or it wasn\\'t really a \\'panic\\' stop at all! If the 6 has a higher level of wheellock tolerance in its ABS settings, that would likely serve to reduce braking distances simply because of that and be (somewhat) unrelated to brake system effectiveness.  I would further suggest that if you don\\'t get your ABS to kick in on what you regard as a \\'panic\\' stop then either the ABS isn\\'t working right or it wasn\\'t really a \\'panic\\' stop at all!i>Oh they were panic stops all right. I credit the lack of ABS activity to a combination of hot asphalt and summer tires. The ABS worked just fine as I told you in the previous post (came on in snow quite often). I would wager that those same summer tires (technically they were all-season OEMs but that was a joke) increased my stopping distance in the winter. However, being that it was a stick I used engine braking a lot during those months.I know for sure that the ABS did not come on when the car pulled out in front of me but it might have come on for the deer. It was dark and cold and my family was in the car so a lot of other things went through my mind and the ABS could have slipped my mind. I don\\'t recall it coming on then though.Believe what you want but I\\'d wager that all Mazda6 owners who participate here will back me up on the great brakes that car has.  Not hauling anything but maybe 3 kids and wife. Mostly doing city driving. I just like the thought of having both power and saving on gas. So far, it seems to me, to have power you have to give up on high mpgs or visa versa. I intend to buy within a year. Thinking of buying slightly used and would keep it for 5 to 10 years. Being that the case, even one mpg difference might mean a lot one day soon. Definitely want something with 4 cyls. Camry hybrid is out of my price range. The Sentra\\'s size is just enough for my needs, but don\\'t want smaller than that. No other small sedan with an A/T that size has 177 Hp, uses regular fuel, and has a new government mpg rating as high as 24 city/ 30 highway. My other car is 06 V6 Rav4 with 3rd row. Mother-in-law just bought the 07 V6 Camry. Took it for a spin. Great ride!I was impressed by the 07 Altima because it showed better performance with improved fuel economy, even if it\\'s only a 1 or 2 mpg difference, you have to admit, it\\'s still impressive. According to Consumer Reports, the 4 cyl Accord 0-60 was 9.0 seconds, the Altima\\'s 8.1, V6 Rav4 0-60 in 6.7 (same engine in the Camry). The new government mpg rating for the Accord city is 21, the Altima\\'s 23 city.Not saying that one car is better than the other, but the new improved Altima has caught my attention.  First you say \"slightly used\" and then say 07 Altima. That would definitely be slightly used considering they are very new. Seems like there would be a very limited number of used 07 Altimas out there right now.  If you can wait for the new accord to come out, you may like the improvements they may make. And if you don\\'t care for it, you can use the new Accord as a way to leverage a better price from the Nissan dealers. It\\'s a win-win situation. Unless you\\'ve got a serious itch, I\\'d wait just a little longer.One other thing...if you\\'re going to have a driving style where your 0-60 times are important to you (in other words gunning it when you have a chance), you can pretty much ignore the EPA estimates cuz you\\'ll probably end up getting much less than that. Since you liked the Camry, it sounds like you like a soft-ish ride. I\\'ve heard the Altima is on the firmer side so make sure that this is ok for you on the type of roads you\\'ll be driving on.  MPG for an 07 I4 automatic Accord is 24, not 20. It is 20 for the 6 cylinder which is much faster in the 0-60. A 4 cylinder Accord is def better on gas than a 6 cyl Altima.  Believe what you want but I\\'d wager that all Mazda6 owners who participate here will back me up on the great brakes that car has. I never said it didn\\'t did I? - if you want to consider a few feet of stopping distance the difference between \\'great\\' (there are a number of primarily European cars that can get into the 110s 60-0) and merely \\'good\\' then all the more power to you - keeping in mind of course that your 4 feet translates into about 1/20 of a second in time reduction it supposedly takes you to stop (from 60) as opposed to the other cars in this group. You do point out a real difference maker in both handling and braking prowess, however, those summer tires you are talking about. Or you could go even further and put in a good set of \\'softer\\' ceramic pads, cross drill some rotors, and maybe rival those BMWs in brake performance. Brake performance has a lot to do with fade resistance and ease of modulation and much less to do with somewhat subjective tested stopping distances, which will vary from car-to-car (and driver-to-driver) in any case.  http://www.iihs.org/sr/pdfs/sr4202.pdf  if you want to consider a few feet of stopping distance the difference between \\'great\\' I never compared the brakes of the 6 to the other car\\'s brakes because I haven\\'t driven any of them recently. So I\\'m not sure why you keep asking me to validate which brakes are good and which are great. You also keep comparing test results like they are some kind of fact and a 6 will always stop 4 feet shorter than an Accord, or whatever else, just because the tests show that. Unless two vehicles are tested on the same day at the same location then the numbers need more information attached to them. C&D now publishes weather data in their test results now, which helps decipher the performance data, but I couldn\\'t find any for any of these cars. Environmental factors can vary results such as stopping distance by several feet. You can start getting into the measurements that equal lengths of cars when that happens and that IS significant.  Interesting article. All that damage at 5 mph. I\\'ll probably be increasing my following distance on the way home...  Even though C&D publishes weather data, they have for years been - and AFAIK continue to be- using a mathmatical equation to correct for atomospheric conditions relating to weather wrt to performance figures such as acceleration and fuel efficiency. I\\'m not sure this would apply to braking, obviously, but its worth noting.  A reporter is hoping to talk with consumers who have participated in Saturn&#146;s &#147;Side-by-Side-by-Side&#148; test drive program. Please respond to [email\\xa0protected] before 4pm Eastern on Friday, August 3 with your daytime contact information and a few words about your experience.  I\\'m not sure this would apply to braking, obviously, but its worth noting.I don\\'t think those adjustments apply to braking and I\\'m pretty sure MT still does the same thing too. I am rather certain that they won\\'t do a braking test in the snow or rain though. That would be unfair because they probably couldn\\'t do both for all makes/models, although it would be useful to the consumer.  Summer tires will work well in dry conditions. If the conditions are slippery, what do you do? Change tires, or stay home? Wet or other slippery conditions are when the most grip is needed. Any tire works good enough for me on dry pavement. I want my tires to be at their best, when the conditions are the worst.  Summer tires will work well in dry conditions. If the conditions are slippery, what do you do? Change tires, or stay home? Wet or other slippery conditions are when the most grip is needed. Any tire works good enough for me on dry pavement. I want my tires to be at their best, when the conditions are the worst.Summer tires work well on wet and dry pavement, in most places it rains during the summer and they are designed for that. They are not designed for cold temperatures, and will become very brittle and hard and not grip the snow and ice. That is why \\'summer tire\\' cars require dedicated snows in winter in cold climates, or switch to all seasons.If you use an all season ultra-high treadwear rating tire, you are already used to that since it is hard and doesn\\'t grip particularly well all year round :P Its interesting as \"traction\" is stamped on the tire with a letter grade, but what it really represents is wet weather braking. It has nothing to do with how well a tire can start on something slippery or how well it corners, just wet braking. Whats more is like all the information printed on the tire, it is tested by the tire manufacturer, not any independent organization (at least for FE, the EPA does the testing).  The Sentra\\'s size is just enough for my needs, but don\\'t want smaller than that. No other small sedan with an A/T that size has 177 Hp, uses regular fuel, and has a new government mpg rating as high as 24 city/ 30 highway. oddly enough, the interior room of the sentra is not much less than the altima, it might even be bigger. When nissan rolled out the versa, they bumped up the size of the sentra quite a bit.  I agree with what you said captain a few posts ago when you were saying that brakes are one of the most significant safety features a car can have. This was definitely illustrated to me quite clearly when that idiot driver in the bmw made a very unsafe left hand turn into my lane when I was going about 50 mph... had I been driving the Accord, the data from Edmunds comparison test of midsize sedans indicate the girl in the passenger seat would likely have been hurt. Given that I stopped within a foot from the front passenger door of the bmw while I was in my Mazda6, the 10 extra feet that the Accord took or the 14 extra feet the Altima took to stop in that comparison test, that extra distance could have led to a very bad accident. I don\\'t know why you keep talking about reaction times...my reaction times are the same if I\\'m driving an Accord or Mazda6, so the distance it would take me to stop would be higher in the Accord than the Mazda according to the car magazines that tested both cars on the same day on the same track with the same driver. Perhaps you\\'re right about some cars slowing down my reaction time... the average midsize sedan would be a bit soft and boring to me and my senses might be dulled as a result and leaving my a bit sleepy and bored, thus a bit slower. Another argument for engaging cars like the Mazda6!!!  The Mazda 6 has good brakes. OK, we got that. It also has average reliability, and not so great fuel economy or acceleration. We know that too.  Has a LOT to do with the only thing actually in contact with the road, the tires.  \"had I been driving the Accord, the data from Edmunds comparison test of midsize sedans indicate the girl in the passenger seat would likely have been hurt\"Just out of curiosity, have you actually measured a panic stop from 60. Your car might be in a condition where as an Accord might handily stop sooner.  Has a LOT to do with the only thing actually in contact with the road, the tires.DING DING DING we have a winner. I am almost positive the somewhat below bar brake ratings on the Accord are due to tire choice.  Likewise. I can induce ABS on dry pavement, so it isn\\'t a lack of braking power that is the issue. It\\'s the lack of grip from the fuel-economy-maximizing Michelins.Aftermarket tires will yield better stopping results, I bet.  In my track experience, the Contour with stock brakes and stock tires seemed balanced, but when I started using the R-compound track tires (that happened to be 20mm wider also), the brakes started to get in over their head. I upgraded the pads and rotors front and rear, added stainless steel flex lines (they are usually rubber) and used a better brake fluid, and the braking improved considerably (more the fade resistance than anything). On street tires, I could invoke ABS at freeway speeds in a panic stop.I don\\'t know what I am going to do with the Accord yet, since Honda put an oddball tire size on the the \\'07 EX, making upgrades more challenging with a 16\" wheel.  If the conditions are slippery, what do you do? Change tires, or stay home?I get in the Explorer with my wife and we both get to work 10 minutes late. Only in very deep snow though. I drove the 6 in an inch or two of snow a few times and only had trouble getting moving on hills. The T/C helped but at times I had to start in 2nd gear. Braking was never a problem because, as I mentioned before, it was a stick and I used the engine compression to supplement the wheel brakes.That is one big reason why I always like to buy a stick equipped car. It\\'s very nice to have in the wintry weather which lasts anywhere from 5-7 months around here.  That is one big reason why I always like to buy a stick equipped car. It\\'s very nice to have in the wintry weather which lasts anywhere from 5-7 months around here. I like the fact that all Honda automatics that I know of allow you to lock into second gear, avoiding first altogether, just by selecting \"2\". All autos should have this option!  Why would you say that? Now your comapring aftermarket on the accord to stock on other cars. its like saying my car is faster than yours after I installed a grand worth of aftermarket parts and you kept yours stock. Is it maybe, just a tiny tiny bit possible the brakes on another car are better than the accord?   Is it maybe, just a tiny tiny bit possible the brakes on another car are better than the accord?Possible? likely? whatever. Sure, other cars may have better brakes. Will it change the mind of someone who wants to buy an Accord? I seriously doubt it. The differences are not that great.  Yeah, I\\'d have to agree the Michelins on my Mazda6 are a bit of a weak point. I have heard from many Mazda6 owners who have changed tires to other brands that cornering, braking, and wet weather handling improves considerably. OEM tires on most of the midsize sedans tend to be a bit too hard and do not emphasize grip as much as long wear. I do plan on upgrading to lighter wheels and better gripping tires in the near future and I can\\'t wait to see the improvements in handling and braking.  and this may all be true, although it was MT that listed both the Fusion and 6 at 131 feet.the following is quoted from motortrend in a midsize comparo (note the mazda6\\'s lack of significant brake fade after repeated 60-0 stops):\"We all agree the 6 has the most well-balanced, confidence-inspiring chassis--especially for navigating the canyons--of our group. It neither understeers nor oversteers when pushed to the limit, and its tires never scream \"mercy!\" While it may lack the brutish punch of the Altima, it more than makes up for it with quick reflexes and sure-footedness. Everything works together in harmony: the supportive seats, good driving position, broad gear ratios, quick steering, and unfailing brakes.We had a suspicion the Mazda 6 would be up to the task at the test track--and it was. The V-6 Mazda ran a 6.67-second 0-60 time with only a mild case of front-wheel hop. We just barely noticed the variable-valve timing and negligible torque steer kicking in somewhere in the upper-rev range when the quarter mile flew past in 15.13 seconds at over 94 mph. Standing on the brake pedal at 60 mph produced an impressively short 121-foot stop that grew only slightly after the fourth or fifth attempt. In the 600-foot slalom, a 63.9-mph pass puts it at the top of this test, as well as near the top of the sedan segment.\"  OEM tires on most of the midsize sedans tend to be a bit too hardthey also tend to be a bit cheap. I think its one of those things where most buyers won\\'t notice the difference, and the manufacturer can save a couple $$$Kind of irritated me that my brand new shinny altima came with $80 continentals on it.  Kind of irritated me that my brand new shinny altima came with $80 continentals on it.Yeah? Well it irritated me when I heard my replacement tires would be $700+ if I wanted the same kind.Lucky for me, i don\\'t. I have Bridgestone Potenza G009s on my 1996 Accord, and will put them on my 2006 Accord when these Michelins wear out. Interestingly, I have 23,000 miles on the \\'06 and have very little wear to show for those miles.  C/D has completed its long-term test on the 2006 Sonata LX. They ran it for 40k miles. Very interesting report, especially for anyone who thinks the Sonata is not competitive in the field, or reliable. Key stat: Cost of non-scheduled maintenance = $0.00. The report is not posted online yet, but here\\'s a couple of quotes: If the interior of a mid-sized U.S. sedan looked this good, the Detroit Free Press would hail it as a worldbeater. Fit and finish and materials are terrific.Then there\\'s that aluminum 235-horse, 3.3-liter V-6, which is as quiet at 70 mph and at wide-open throttle as a BMW 335i\\'s and is way, way quieter at idle. It performs other BMW-ish feats, too, such as pulling the Sonata all the way to 144 mph, or, if you\\'re caught on photo radar in Scottsdale, 147 mph... . All of that for a paltry $23,495 or $23,645 today.  All of that for a paltry $23,495 or $23,645 today. That doesn\\'t sound paltry to me. Where can I read the rest of the story? (Since I know you only copied the good parts).  I\\'m sure you can find two sentences of \"good stuff\" in any car\\'s review (even the Sebring).  Ok, I normally don\\'t do this, but I think I can be nit-picky for a second.Then there\\'s that aluminum 235-horse, 3.3-liter V-6, which is as quiet at 70 mph and at wide-open throttle as a BMW 335i\\'s and is way, way quieter at idleA BMW is a sports car, not a lux-cruiser. Its supposed to be louder, more visceral, more raw. It would be kind of like saying car A Malibu offers more legroom and fuel economy than a Mercedes C350 sedan. Not really that impressive to me, since the BMW isn\\'t going for the whole \"quiet serene\" thing, that is far from its purpose.A car being quieter than a BMW does nota a BMW-ish car make. That\\'s my opinion (right or wrong). I like the Sonata and think it is a good automobile. That part of the article bugs me though.  1) it is a good car, though others are better. If you take it for a test spin and look over the interior closely, I think most people would say, pretty good, as in 80% or 85% that of an Accord or Aura. It simply doesn\\'t have the steering and overall refinement of the best. It is fine for the money, if you keep it though the warranty period.2) Other cars will go pretty darn fast without a speed limiter. As for the 147 MPH, I guess it is all things possible, but I am not so sure that is accurate. Strong tail wind :surprise: I will take an inline 6 made by BMW any day over a Hyundai, thank you.3) I paid around $22,500 for an Accord SE V6 and it should cost me less than a Sonata to own, should I sell it in three to five years time frame.Just my take,Loren  80 to 85% as good? I disagree.As for price, bang for the buck, we got an \\'07 Sonata SE w/ XM (& floor mats, big deal) for $16,651 plus $189 doc + TTL for a total OTD of $18,189. I don\\'t know where the Accord SE fits in Honda\\'s line up or how it is equipped compared to the Sonate SE, but based on your paid price of about $22,500 our Sonata was at least $4,300 less, assuming your \"about\" $22,500 was the OTD price. $4300 sure as heck covers a lot of the depreciation Edmuind\\'s uses in calculaing TCO. (Our purchase price was a couple/few thousand less than Edmund\\'s TMV at the time.)  Keep in mind that C/D was quoting MSRPs, not typical out-the-door prices on the Sonata LX. $19k is a more typical price for that car, although I\\'ve seen some buyers get better deals. That is for a car comparable to the Accord EX-L V6 but w/o moonroof (C/D didn\\'t get it on their tester).Right now, the only place you can read the rest of the long-term wrapup on the Sonata is the September issue of C/D. Eventually they\\'ll post it on their web site, www.caranddriver.com.And yes, there is some negative stuff in the review, e.g. it doesn\\'t handle like a sports car and it doesn\\'t make the driver stand out in a crowd. But what mid-sized family cars do? Overall I think you\\'ll see it\\'s a very positive review. (There\\'s a lot more than two positive quotes in there.)  bhmr59, isn\\'t that Sonata a 4cylinder model? That\\'s not a good comparison to an SE V6 Accord. If you were to drive both, the difference would be clear. It will also be clear at resale time. My 03 EX V6 is 4 years old with 48k miles on it, and it\\'s still probably worth more than that Sonata is. Apples to Oranges sir.  No, for 2007 the Sonata SE was V6 only. For 2008 you can get it with an I4 or V6.As for the value of your Accord, Ecmunds.com says it\\'s worth from $13.4k (trade-in) to $15k (private party sale). Original MSRP was just under $26k. Don\\'t know what your price was, but it\\'s lost about $10k in value. I don\\'t think bhmr59\\'s Sonata has lost $10k in value yet, and if it\\'s worth less than your car right now, consider that he paid far less than you did for your car. I\\'ll bet his car, if properly taken care of, will be worth more than $6500 when it\\'s four years old, if it has only 48k miles on it then (it\\'ll still have factory warranty to the next owner!). As you said, apples and oranges.  bhmr59 sure gets excited about a car he doesn\\'t even own (his brother does). I paid $25,000 for the car I wanted, because I plan to drive it for a long time (probably 10 more years). So my true-cost-to-own will be pretty low by then. Would I want to drive a Sonata for that long? Would it last that long? If bhmr59\\'s brother wants to take a chance, he is welcome to. I want a sure thing.  I have had a lot of cars where the cost of non-scheduled maintenance is $0.00 after three years or so. Here is my question, what is the cost of maintenance on a car after three years? (obviously excluding gas, insurance, tires but including consumables such as wipers, brakes, oil, etc)- My BMW, total outlay after 3 years was $250 for the dealer alarm system.- Friend bought has Acura in for 7K service, cost $300 ouch, however $0.00 on non-scheduled maintenance to date.- My Toyota cost $500 for 30K service, ouch, but $0.00 on non-scheduled maintenance.So that fact that $0.00 was spent on non-scheduled is not very impressive and misleading.  So that fact that $0.00 was spent on non-scheduled is not very impressive and misleading. doesn\\'t impress me either. my 98 200sx total expense over 9 years has been about 400 in brakes + the scheduled stuff like oil changes and flushes. hasn\\'t needed any unscheduled maintenance. My 2002 civic hasn\\'t needed anything but oilchanges, cooling system flushes ect and a timing belt that was schedulded to be replaced at 110k, and I replaced it at 100k. didn\\'t break or anything.But yea, 3 years doesn\\'t seem like much. most people haven\\'t even paid for it yet  My Mazda6 came with tires that are priced at $201 each at tire rack. Not what I would call cheap. I certainly won\\'t be spending $800+ on tires when it comes time to replace them, though.  Yes, some manufacturers skimp on tires, some don\\'t.  I certainly won\\'t be spending $800+ on tires when it comes time to replace them, though.+1  Are there any good forums to discuss quality tires that are a good bang for the buck?Other than America\\'s tire\\'s website that includes user reviews?  The fact that C/D\\'s long-term Sonata tester required $0 in non-scheduled maintenance in 40k miles obviously impressed C/D\\'s editors. I\\'m not sure how saying a car had zero non-scheduled maintenance or repair costs is misleading. It\\'s possible for tires, brakes, and other components to need replacement within 40k miles. Also, most other bumper-to-bumper warranties expire after 36k miles, so it\\'s possible to have non-warranty maintenance costs after that (except not on the Sonata of course, not until 5 years or 60k miles).  \"I\\'m not sure how saying a car had zero non-scheduled maintenance or repair costs is misleading.\"I know a lot of owners who have $0 in non-scheduled maintenance the three or four years up to 50,000 miles. To me it is a big so-what. With any warranty there shouldn\\'t be any dollars associated with non-scheduled maintenance. What is more interesting are the number of warranty repair visits a car requires. (That would be the same number as needing a warranty repair and not bringing the car in for whatever reason) Also interesting is the projected amount spent on dealer scheduled maintenance.  I don\\'t want to spend my time bringing a car to the dealer, even if it is under warranty. I would rather not bring it to the dealer at all, for anything. Time is money. Doing your own maintenance can do wonders for the \"true cost to own\" equation. :shades:  That\\'s a good point. C/D has long-term wrapups on two other mid-sized family cars on their web site (http://www.caranddriver.com/features/13266/long-term-tests.html?al=131): 2002 Camry SE V6 and 2003 Mazda6s. Here\\'s the maintenance story for them and the Sonata (from the September 2007 C/D issue):2003 Mazda6sScheduled services: 5Unscheduled services: 0Repair cost: $0Total maintenance cost: $4432002 Camry SE V6:Scheduled services: 5Unscheduled services: 0Repair cost: $0Total maintenance cost: $7502006 Sonata LX:Scheduled services: 5Unscheduled services: 0Repair cost: $0Total maintenance cost: $608So the Sonata compares very well to two of Japan\\'s best mid-sized cars over 40k miles in terms of number of warranty visits and scheduled maintenance costs (note also the Sonata\\'s costs are in 2006-2007 dollars).  That\\'s interesting. The repair cost mirrors my own regarding cars owned during the first three to four years, they all are reliable. However, all of my Nissans had a number of unscheduled warranty visits, that were more than annoyance factors. My Jeep had one vist at the end to fix a window regulator. BMW had a couple of unscheduled visits, one to replace an alloy wheel under warranty damaged at the car wash (that\\'s called customer service) and the other to tighten the antenna connection (oh yeah the third for the alarm installation). One of my current cars had 0 visits so far, the other had a minor warranty item dealing with the backseat release taken care of during an oil change.Bottom line, all cars except my Nissans faired well, which is why I stay away from Nissan today.  They all do, depending on what you buy. though my 2.5 altima came with what I\\'d call cheap tires, I don\\'t believe those $80-90 conti\\'s are on the 3.5SE, or a maxima. But it does irritate me, because that tire has a speed rating of \"s\", which means the limiter is probably set to 110 or 114 mph.   Elmo, both my brother\\'s \\'07 Sonata SE AND my \\'05 Sonata GLS Special Value, are owned by our 2 man business. I don\\'t technically own either car, I basically make financial decisions for our business. He is the one who is still excited about the car he has driven since February. We do generally keep our cars for ten years, so the depreciation difference, if any, is minimal. \"My\" last generation Sonata has been great since \"we\" bought it in 4/05 and I look forward to many more years of reliable service from it, backed by the 5/60, 10/100 warranty. Both are 6 cyl; as backy said, all \\'07 Sonata SE\\'s are 6 cyl. The only sure thing is that you paid $25K (not sure if that was OTD or just for the car before dealer fees + TTL). Our OTD for the \\'07 Sonata SE was $18,189 (with sales tax @ 6%)-- or at least $7K less than you paid for your Honda Accord SE. Does your Honda have ABS, ESC, Traction Control, Electronic Brake Distribution and front & rear head air bags? I\\'m sure there are other differences in equipment. Remember, we are talking about \\'07, or earlier, cars. Early this year, I did not care about what Honda may offer for \\'08.  But it does irritate me, because that tire has a speed rating of \"s\", which means the limiter is probably set to 110 or 114 mph. Yeah, and we all know how often 110 MPH just isn\\'t enough!   Does your Honda have ABS, ESC, Traction Control, Electronic Brake Distribution and front & rear head air bags? I\\'m sure there are other differences in equipment. Remember, we are talking about \\'07, or earlier, cars. Early this year, I did not care about what Honda may offer for \\'08. My \\'03 Accord LX V6 had ABS, Traction Control (TCS), Electronic Brake Distribution, and front curtain air bags. It also had 240HP with 30 highway miles per gallon, something the Sonata has struggled to duplicate either.  Does your Honda have ABS, ESC, Traction Control, Electronic Brake Distribution and front & rear head air bags?My 03 EX V6 Accord has side and side curtain airbags, traction control, and a 5 star crash rating (something the 03 Sonata did not have).It took 4 years for Hyundai to catch up, and with the 08 model the Sonata will be left in the dust again. You can fool yourself into believing the Sonata is in the same league as the Accord, but like many other midsize cars, it\\'s a generation behind.  Is your Accord EX the same as the Accord SE? Is it a higher or lower trim line? Did it have ESC?I thought the EX-V6 was the top Accord...the SE Sonata is the mid-level Sonata.  I don\\'t plan on driving much at that speed, but the speedometer goes up to 160. Now, at 175 HP it won\\'t go that fast, but sure would be fun to find out where the top speed actually is. :surprise:  You got a car listed as $21,445 for 16,651 = Wow! Good price. Not a bad deal, even if the car is 80 to 85% compared to the others. Not a bad deal. They are selling about half their cars to rental fleet and now giving away the rest. This doesn\\'t bode well for the future. There is no way I can argue though that if you keep the car for a long time, the deal was not a good one. You made a deal! As for performance, it all depends on how you drive a car. Most people will see little difference between most of the makes on the road. Loren  I don\\'t know if I\\'d say that the Sonata is a generation behind the Accord...I drove the Sonata over a few days and came away much more impressed with it than I thought I would. It was quiet, smooth, had plenty of power, and ergonomic (besides the driver seat which was cutting circulation off in my right hamstring unless I tipped the front seat so far forward I was sliding out). And I have seen the pics of the redone center stack in the Sonata and it is much much better than before. I did like the Accord better overall in the interior design and having a slightly firmer suspension (I happen to prefer this) while having a lot less body lean in corners. But it\\'d be hard for me to pay 4 or 5k more for the accord when the Sonata would be perfectly acceptable especially when considering Consumer Reports and JD Powers rate most of these midsize cars almost identically (on a percentage basis) for reliability over a five year period. Once again, the Accord lovers in this forum want to make a mountain out of a mole hill and say that the Accord is in a \"different league\" or that we \"fool ourselves\" into thinking another car is comparable when really the differences are not that significant. Just a snobbish attitude if you ask me...they are both good cars and are worthy of consideration in this category.  And the LX V6 was Accord\\'s midline model..... at least for V6\\'s.... comparable to the SE on either the Accord or Sonata now.  A Honda SE V6 has stability control, traction control, electronic brake force, all those air bags, a 6 CD changer, and all that jazz. The difference is in the car. The Honda is faster, and handles better, and has better steering feedback / feel. The interior is of better quality. Don\\'t know about Edmund\\'s resale values as quoted here are for, but overall, going by Kelly Book, Honda Accord has always been near the top for resale value. Sonata is going to have to be so much lower. You can not run half your sale via fleet and run huge discounts without running the resale values down -- sorry but that\\'s life.I fully understand how the Sonata can work as a cost saving car, if bought and held for a decade. From an economics point of view, in this case scenario, fine - good enough choice. And if you love or really like some element of Sonata or Hyundai over the rest, then fine too, to each his own, and it is right for you. Ultimately what is right for the person opening up the wallet, is the correct car for that individual.Everyone has different priorities.Loren  According to Car and Driver, the Altima is governed to 112 MPH (CVT).For comparison:Chrysler Sebring Touring117 MPH (173hp, 4-sp Auto)Honda Accord SE130 MPH (166 hp, 5-sp Auto)Kia Optima EX125 MPH** (161 hp, 5-sp Auto)Saturn Aura XE106 MPH (224 hp, 4-sp Auto)Toyota Camry LE126 MPH (158 hp, 5-sp Auto)**All cars are governed to their speeds electronically except for the Kia Optima, which is incapable of going faster (drag limited).  Accord SE comes with those Michelin tires which cost $210 or so at Costco, unless they are running that $60 off, or whatever it is at the time. This makes the tires say perhaps $250 retail each = ouch! Come the time, if I still own the car, I am thinking Kumho tires. Some of those are rated excellent for performance, with I am sure less tread life. But the cost, of the better Kumho tires for the car is around half that of the Michelin, as per TireRack research. Yokohamas may be good too. Of course the Michelin tires could last 50K miles, if I slowed for corners. They put the tire pressure at 32 after the oil change. I am thinking 34 may be best. A little scuffing on those edges, do I see!As for speed, was it 2007 model of the Sonata which did not have any speed limiter? I think they do now for 2008. I don\\'t have any desire to go up to 130 MPH, and if I did, I am thinking Mercedes tank, or maybe a larger BMW??? A wreck at speeds over 100 can not be a good thing.Loren  I\\'m pretty sure every new car out there has a limiter now. they set it according to the speed rating of the tires. but a quick reprogram of the ecm can fix that. :P  I know where its governed at, I\\'d like to see what its capable of. as I said, speedometer goes to 160, but no way a 175hp I4 will reach that. I\\'m guessing 130-140. but with the damn speed limiter I\\'ll probably never get to find out.  The MSRP was $22,080 including destination. The $16,651 also incuded destination.  It also had 240HP with 30 highway miles per gallon, something the Sonata has struggled to duplicate either.It is very much possible.EPA 08 ratings:2007 Sonata V6: 18/272007 Accord V6: 18/26Call it a tie and move on.  You can fool yourself into believing the Sonata is in the same league as the Accord, but like many other midsize cars, it\\'s a generation behind.Funny how a lot of people wouldn\\'t necessarily agree with you. Let me say this, the Accord is great, but to say the Sonata (and many other midsize sedans) are a generation behind, that\\'s about an igorant view as you can get. I\\'d love to hear the reasoning and details why the Sonata (and most other midsize sedans) are one generation behind the Accord.  Are there any good forums to discuss quality tires that are a good bang for the buck? Tires, tires, tires.   If that is what Sonatas are selling for they are priced right. Most buyers are willing to pay a premium for a Honda or a Toyota. They will not pay a premium for a Chevy or Hyundai. Basically, a Hyundai, and a Chevy for that matter, has to be priced quite a bit cheaper than a Honda. Haven\\'t driven a Sonota, although I did sit in one (a rental), terrible seat, but I drove a Santa Fe which was nice. The dealer said I can have whatever Santa Fe I wanted at invoice. Sounds like the Sonatas are discounted more. I had an uncle shop for an elantra a few years ago and the dealer would deal at all. That turned him off real quick.  Why would you say that? Now your comapring aftermarket on the accord to stock on other cars. its like saying my car is faster than yours after I installed a grand worth of aftermarket parts and you kept yours stock. Is it maybe, just a tiny tiny bit possible the brakes on another car are better than the accord?Sorry, out of town for the weekend. As far as the comparison with the Accord, I said it needed better tires. Then I did an example of how tires and brakes are related, based on my experience with a Ford Contour.I concur that the brakes on other cars can be stronger, although the Accord brakes seem like they are a bit \"touchy.\"  Accord SE comes with those Michelin tires which cost $210 or so at Costco, unless they are running that $60 off, or whatever it is at the time. This makes the tires say perhaps $250 retail each = ouch! Come the time, if I still own the car, I am thinking Kumho tires. Some of those are rated excellent for performance, with I am sure less tread life. But the cost, of the better Kumho tires for the car is around half that of the Michelin, as per TireRack research. Yokohamas may be good too. Of course the Michelin tires could last 50K miles, if I slowed for corners. They put the tire pressure at 32 after the oil change. I am thinking 34 may be best. A little scuffing on those edges, do I see!I don\\'t like to skimp on tires, but I have found a number of anomalies where you don\\'t always get what you pay for. I have been very happy with the Kumhos on the old Accord (more so than the Bridgestones on the new one). I agree with the idea of bumping inflation pressure a lil bit to get some handling out though. It seems like the thread was about crummy tires as opposed to cheap ones. Whats worse is the Accord has a weird 16\" size making it difficult to find upgraded tires.  You can fool yourself into believing the Sonata is in the same league as the Accord, but like many other midsize cars, it\\'s a generation behind.Our 2007 SEL AWD Fusion is definitely not \"a generation behind\" any Accord, even the 2008 when it debuts. The Accord is, no doubt, a fine mid-size automobile but its relationship to the rest of the field is more a matter of splitting hairs.For example, our Fusion has all-wheel drive, something not even offered on an Accord at any price.  While AWD is nice, I\\'m not sure it would be an option that would still have me say the Fusion is as polished as the Accord. IMO, hairs are not being split, but to each their own.  For those who feel, and rightly so the majority of the time, that Hyundai resale values are dismal, consider this example. My neighbor bought a 2006 Hyundai Elantra GLS Automatic 4-door sedan (Yes, I know this forum is for Midesize sedans, but thought this would be informative for the readers) for his wife in February 2006, and paid $13,500, including sales tax (6.5%), title, and license/registration. The original sticker MSRP was $15,220, so he got a very decent deal on the purchase.Although his wife initially loved the car, she realized some time later that she wanted something a bit larger for carrying all of her friends to luncheons, etc. During its tenure in their family, she had absolutely no problems with it, it was in perfect \"as new\" condition, and it had only 9,400 miles on the odometer. To make a long story short, he just sold it (privately) for her through a listing in the local newspaper\\'s classifieds - the selling price: $12,500. A year and a half of ownership for $1,000 - not bad in my opinion. Of course, it helped that the buyer was looking for a pristine 2006, and not the current generation.   Let me say this, the Accord is great, but to say the Sonata (and many other midsize sedans) are a generation behind, that\\'s about an igorant view as you can get. I\\'d love to hear the reasoning and details why the Sonata (and most other midsize sedans) are one generation behind the Accord. Ok, I\\'ll give it to you the way I see it (you may see things differently). Many other midsize cars were introduced at least 3 years after the Accord. Yet the Accord wins MOST comparison tests (CR, C&D, among others) competing against these recently redesigned cars. The current Accord has been around since 03. The Sonata 06, Fusion 06, Camry 07, Altima 07, Aura 07. The Altima is the only car that is close, and it took Nissan 4 years to do it. And who\\'s to say the next generation of these other cars will be able to best the current Accord. Well, that\\'s my opinion (of course opinions are like mileage, and will vary widely). You can call it ignorant if you like, but that\\'s my reasoning.:P  There are only a couple of things from competing cars that I wish I had in my Accord.First, I wish my Accord had the hatchback from the Mazda6. Second, the 6-speed manual from the Altima (my 4-cylinder Accord is but a 5-speed manual).Third, an auxiliary hookup for the stereo (iPod, etc.) I think several competitors have this.   \\'The dealer said I can have whatever Santa Fe I wanted at invoice. \\'I bought my Pilot for $29k and the msrp on it was $35,600. That is $3500 below invoice. Honda gives dealers cash to move vehicles even though incentives aren\\'t advertised. Hyundai\\'s aren\\'t the only vehicles sold at invoice or below.  According to Car and Driver, the Altima is governed to 112 MPH (CVT). For comparison: Chrysler Sebring Touring 117 MPH (173hp, 4-sp Auto) Honda Accord SE 130 MPH (166 hp, 5-sp Auto) Kia Optima EX 125 MPH** (161 hp, 5-sp Auto) Saturn Aura XE 106 MPH (224 hp, 4-sp Auto) Toyota Camry LE 126 MPH (158 hp, 5-sp Auto) **All cars are governed to their speeds electronically except for the Kia Optima, which is incapable of going faster (drag limited). BMW 335i150 MPH (300 hp, 6 speed man.) Electronically Limited....noisier at top speed than a Sonata....darn it.   There has been some rumors flying around the new Mazda6 and it looks like one of the rumors has turned out to be true. Some have been suggesting that Mazda was going to take Ford\\'s 3.5 and work their magic on it. The CX-9 will be the first (and hopefully not the last) to get the new 3.7 liter that has 10 more hp (from 263 to 273) and a big bump in torque (from 249 to 270). Of course it\\'s still too early to know if the Mazda6 will be getting this same engine, but it would be quite a development if it did. And if AWD gets added to the list of options for this car, that could make a huge leap in performance to a car that already performs quite well.  Yes, and a whole 3 mph faster than a Sonata. Well worth the 65 extra hp and the $15k extra cash, I\\'d say.   Well, if actually going at those speeds, as in say around 120MPH on the Autobahn, something tells me yes, I would pay the $15K more and then some for a German car, be it BMW or Mercedes. You know, something actually made to drive at high speed. Don\\'t think I would take the Sonata up over 100 maybe 105, though I guess it could feel stable at high speeds. Not wishing to become a national statistic as in 1144, I have no death wish for driving that fast. The 120 to 150 MPH speeds are best left to race tracks, or the Autobahn, in Mercedes, Bimmers, or Porches.Wonder what the Korean word is for oh sh** :surprise: Loren  Wonder what the Korean word is for oh sh** I believe the proper translation is \"Daewoo.\"   Wonder what the Korean word is for oh sh** Sonata    It would be fantastic if Mazda keeps their V6 pricing levels about the same, you know more in line with the Fusion and Sonata V6s, than with Accord, Camry and Altima V6s. Then they would really have a winning formula.I am afraid, however, that they will increase prices significantly with the new model as it is supposed to be larger, more powerful, etc. I hope they don\\'t price themselves out of the market as they have been known to do lately. Witness the huge rebates/discounts and/or slower than expected sales on Mazdaspeed6 and RX-8. IMHO, both of those cars were priced too high to begin with.Currently, Mazda6 V6s are moving in the low 20\\'s right? This is a couple grand less than Japanese competitors. When the new model comes out, are you going to be able to find a Mazda6 V6 in the low 20\\'s? If they price themselves the same as Accord and Altima, IMO they will continue to have sales troubles.  Well if you have to question why someone would do it, I would say you are not in the customer demographic.   I wouldn\\'t do it because of 3 more mph, especially since the Sonata\\'s top speed is 2X the legal limit of any state I\\'d drive it in.  I wouldn\\'t do it because of 3 more mph, especially since the Sonata\\'s top speed is 2X the legal limit of any state I\\'d drive it in. If you think that 3 mph top speed difference is the only performance variant between a 335i and a Sonata, then you have never driven nor would likely appreciate the difference. As kdshipiro said, you aren\\'t the target demographic. Some things are worth the extra cost, imho.Back on track with the topic, I think the Sonata is a fairly good car, just boring. The car I would most likely pick out of this group would be the Subaru Legacy Spec-B.   \"I\\'m sure the Honda crowd will be all over this, but envy shows up in different ways! :P \"I\\'ll be the first from the \"Honda crowd\" to say that I like it.However, from this angle, I see some similarities to the current generation Accord, notably the shape of the hood and the \"haunches\" over the front wheels, plus the rough shape of the headlights and the grille.Look at this picture of a current generation Accord (with a Mugen lower bumper and some JDM details)  True. But I see a lot more RX-8 and Mazda2 than I do Accord. IMO it\\'s also more aggressive than the current Accord.  \"True. But I see a lot more RX-8 and Mazda2 than I do Accord. IMO it\\'s also more aggressive than the current Accord.\"Absolutely. I just wanted to point out the styling cues I picked up from that shot. When we get to see additional pictures I\\'m sure it will have its own unique look. It will certainly be more aggressive, likely handling sharper and riding tigher than the current Accord.  I hope the new Mazda6 is so good that they can charge as much as the Accord and Altima... thing is, most of the cars in this segment are really good and to expect or hope that any new car will leave others in the dust is unrealistic. and to get people to think of the Mazda6 beyond zoom-zoom or as a niche product will take a huge and successful marketing effort which they have not shown themselves to be capable of. So although when the car is first released and assuming it gets some good press it will likely sell much nearer to MSRP than now, when the honeymoon is over, I\\'m sure a price advantage will have to be part of Mazda\\'s strategy for it to be more successful than the current Mazda6.  This is technically a repost of #3915, since the image was too large. I apologize for that.Anyway, here\\'s the first official photo from Mazda of the second-gen Mazda6:  Good first impression.  Thank you.   thanks for posting this! looks good from the front, but the profile and the back are what I think are the most important. Nice to see the real thing coming out albeit piece by piece. The front fender flair must be pretty large to get that shape up front though. Looks to be an aggressive looking car...  I was comparing an 03 Sonata to 03 Accord. If you are going to compare different model generations, the let\\'s compare the \\'08 Accords mileage to Any Sonata made to date...Last I checked, Sonata still hasn\\'t reached Honda\\'s 244 HP mark....  Eww, I\\'ll pass.My honest thought? \"Why is somebody posting the Mazda 2 on here?\"It looks so bulbous, tall, and narrow. It\\'s like an Opel design gone bad, to me.If I had to choose, I\\'d DEFINITELY take the current 6 over this thing.  I kinda like the hips on that in the front, it actually has a little curve to it. It looks more nimble to me, I think its because the aggressive fender flares make the car look lower and wider.  Just goes to show how a different design can be interpreted by different people.I look forward to new pictures other than this awkward-looking one to help change my mind, because I like Mazda\\'s current look (except for the Tribute and CX-7).  Yeah, I also think the pictures can be misleading...I really didn\\'t care for the Subaru Impreza photos when they leaked/released, but it looks a bit better in person. I guess I will reserve judgment until I see it on the ground.  One pretty big thing to note about the new 6 is that it will no longer be built on the CD3 platform but rather the new Euro CD platform which the Mondeo rides on. Once the Fusion is switched over to that platform in a few years Ford will finally have their Japanese, Euro, and U.S. branded mid-sized sedans on the same platform finally. I think the new 6 looks fantastic too BTW!  looks very sporty..... Mazda\\'s version of Audi\\'s R8?  could very well leave everyone else a \"generation\" behind.  Only in your mind......  Horse hockey. There are dozens of non-German cars that will cruise at 120-150 mph safely. The Corvette, the Mazdaspeed6 and the Pontiac (Holden) GTO (soon to be the Pontiac G8) for example.  If you think that 3 mph top speed difference is the only performance variant between a 335i and a Sonata, then you have never driven nor would likely appreciate the difference.Uh... no. Read what I said again, please. I wouldn\\'t spend $15k extra because of 3 mph more (147 vs. 150 top speed). There\\'s other attributes of a 3 Series I might spend the money to get, however.  Time will tell, can\\'t wait to hear the specs!  What would a profit-makin, $20k mid-size Bimmer perform like? They don\\'t have one but could they offer one that could compete in this segment There is not one Europeon car offered at this price to the world\\'s largest auto market which implies a number of things(Saturn\\'s don\\'t count either). With the Euro valued 37% higher than the dollar, good luck finding one ever!  Yuk, yuk, yuk...you shore are witty!!  His point is just because the Sonota is speed limited to 150, doesn\\'t mean that it will stable at that speed. While some other cars are extremely stable at that speed and higher.  His point is just because the Sonota is speed limited to 150, doesn\\'t mean that it will stable at that speed. While some other cars are extremely stable at that speed and higher.Thank you kdshapiro. That was my point exactly, along with the 335i reaching terminal, although limited, velocity quicker than the Sonata. Raw numbers alone don\\'t tell the whole story. I only piped up originally because the Sonata was reported to be quieter than the 335i. The point is most people who purchase a 335i want to hear that I6 TT at full howl. What a sweet sound it is. I\\'ll say this again for clarity, I am not slamming the Sonata. I think it is an acceptable base car to compete on the lower end of the Midsize Sedan market. I do not think it is an equal to the Accord or Legacy however. IMHO   Can be done and tested with a simple test drive..... but you\\'d have to find a salesman willing to let you cruise at 120 MPH plus.....Trust me, you will feel the difference between cars\\' handling capabilities, feel, and stability at high speeds.  Polo!You can, if you so wish to drive any car of your choosing that fast on the Autobahn. There are few cars I would feel safe in though at those speeds. I would put a full cage in that Mazdaspeed before entering into the 120 - 150 MPH range, but then again, I am not you so it won\\'t hurt anyway. Sonata wreck at 100+ MPH ...hummmm? Guess those Corvettes hold up well in high speed wrecks, though there has never been any testing done which we can use to determine how they do compared to other cars in the normal crash tests. Wonder what a wrecked Corvette would look like if the speed was over 100 MPH at the time? I have considered a C4 but the back is said oh no, then a C5 which is easy in and out of. Wonder how they do in the real world? I think the records indicate a lower than average injury rate and a higher than average death rate, if memory serves me right. Go figure! 120 - 150 MPH crashes = ouch!If anyone has any data from a crash test, please post a link, thankxLoren  I have been following the forum for quite a while now. In January 07, my wife and I purchased a midnight blue Aura XR with the moroccan brown leather. Beautiful car. I know the Camry and Accord are the top sellers, but I truly think most people are missing out by not considering the Aura. The 3.6 with the 6 speed automatic is a gem. Just returned to San Diego from Las Vegas. The car was made for that trip. Tankfuls were 27 mpg, 26mpg, 28 mpg and 27 mpg. Climate control at 73 degrees. We have just over 3500 miles on the car.I was curious before the trip to see how it would pull the grades. Most hills no downshift at all. On the long grade before Baker, one downshift into 5th and 80 mph at 2500 rpm.The car is extremely quiet. The gearing certainly encourages highspeed running, 80 mph in 6th is 21-2200 rpm.One thing we have learned is that the transmission takes about 1000 miles to truly learn your driving style. The transmission learns over that time. After 1000 miles, it seems to never make a misstep. Add 5star crash testing all around, plus my wife loves the adjustable pedals and you have one great car. Originally I was concerned that 252 horsepower would not be enough with Camrys with 268 and Altimas with 270, but believe me, I never thought I would say this, 252 is more than enough.Unlike the Camry, it doesn\\'t float. I have a 2006 Impala LS I drive for work, great car, but the Aura is in another league for curves. Steering feel is so much better in the Aura. It just does everything well.  Most average cars don\\'t hold up well in high speed crashes. These pictures were taken after a wreck which occurred less than 5 miles from my house in December 2006. I didn\\'t take them, they are posted on the local news channel website. The car shown, a Honda Accord, was stopped at a light when it was hit from behind by a Nissan Pathfinder which was estimated to be traveling at around 60 mph. Witnesses say they heard the big engine revving up at full throttle moments before the impact... The driver of the Pathfinder was fine, but the Accord\\'s occupants did not make it, as well as a motorcyclist. Very sad, and scary.  No, you are not slamming the Sonata. But you used a four-letter word that starts with \"sh\" to describe it. You meant it as a compliment then, as in \"oh sh**, what a nice car!\"?The Sonata is not the equal to the Legacy in one important aspect: Legacy has standard AWD. In some other aspects, the Sonata is superior to the Legacy. As for being equal to the Accord, the Sonata is superior in some ways and not as good in others. So \"better\" is relative to what the buyer is looking for. If someone is looking for a mid-sized car with lots of room, strong performance, excellent safety features, and would like to spend as little as possible for it, the Sonata might be \"better\" in that buyer\\'s eyes than the Accord. The Accord might be better for someone looking for, for example, crisper handling.  I wouldn\\'t want to get into a high speed crash in any car. Even the CTS, of which a high profile car crash was covered in NJ, burned up in a high speed collision.If you make it out of one of these wrecks, G-d was on your side for the day.  As a car IMO, the Accord is better in the absolute sense. But you are right in the way you refer to buyers priorities. Using your baseline, a Lincoln Town car can be a better than vehicle for some buyers than a 750i if one is looking for a roomy luxo sedan at a much cheaper price. In the absolute sense though I would take the 750 over the Town Car in a heartbeat.  Loren,I don\\'t think Corvettes do specifically well in crashes.Supposedly, this Vette crashed into trees at \"a high rate of speed\" in New Jersey.  At speeds in the 100mph range, no car (without a real roll cage) is safe. 5 star crash ratings are to show injury rates for \"minor crashes\". Anything approaching 100mph is not minor.  Given that crash tests are designed to replicate a crash between two cars traveling 35 mph, I don\\'t even want to think about crashes over 100.  Trees tend to always win. How did the driver and passenger do. Doesn\\'t look good.&Thanks for the site... I looked up Wrecked Exotics. Interesting.Loren  No, you are not slamming the Sonata. But you used a four-letter word that starts with \"sh\" to describe it. You meant it as a compliment then, as in \"oh sh**, what a nice car!\"? That part about the \"oh sh**\\', I was definitely joking about. I apologize if you were offended. Please don\\'t be.The Sonata is not the equal to the Legacy in one important aspect: Legacy has standard AWD. In some other aspects, the Sonata is superior to the Legacy.

The Accord might be better for someone looking for, for example, crisper handling. I completely agree with everything you said here. I personally think of the Legacy as a little small to be a mid-size but it is a great drive, especially in the Spec-B and GT forms. The Accord is a also a very good car even if it is a little boring to drive. It is boring to me, not to everyone.Even though the Sonata may not be my favorite car in this list, I would agree that it has some appeal, especially the warranty. If you keep a car a long time the long warranty would be appealing. This is what is so great about current auto offerings, there is something for everyone. The bottom line is you have to decide what best fits your needs and makes you happy. Happy motoring.   The Sonata is not the equal to the Legacy in one important aspect: Legacy has standard AWD.

I think the handling of the Subie is much sharper, the steering feel is better, and the overall feel is sportier. I think the tires are grippier, the brakes felt less mushy, and the visibility was better for me. The Accord might be better for someone looking for, for example, crisper handling.I hope it gets better than this. I feel most bumps on the freeway, and the car corners like a wounded farm animal. I am hoping the tires are to blame, but there is still a lot of body roll.  OEM tires in favor of MPG and in disfavor to handling.  You think the Accord has a lot of body roll?? The stock tires may slide around hard corners, but there is very little body roll. You certainly don\\'t want to try cornering hard in a Camry or Sonata :surprise: , if you think the Accord has a lot of body roll.  True, if we\\'re talking about the midsize class.IMO, the best handling to worst handling goes like this (not all cars will be included, just the ones i have firsthand experience with). These are all also 2006 models.Mazda 6 (Feel every pebble)Ford Fusion (Feel every other pebble, but much closer to Accord)Honda Accord (My favorite balance, firm but compliant enough for me)Nissan Altima (Didn\\'t stand out as good in either category)Hyundai Sonata (As balanced towards smoothness as the Accord is to sportiness - impressive ride)Toyota Camry (One word - creamy)  In a Camry with narrow tires made me end up going sideways down two lanes on a freeway. Luckily, I was able to keep it going in a direction where I didn\\'t hit anyone, and no one hit me. I felt the tires were undersized, but the suspension being so soft definitely had something to do with it. Obviously, I wasn\\'t used to driving the Parents\\' Camry.You can change lanes quickly, but don\\'t try and change your \"change\" right after making the change in a Camry! Got it? :P  Remember the Lexus commercials a long time ago where they showed them driving over rail road tracks (along the track, not across) in order to demonstrate how \"good\" the suspension was? The driver might as well have been driving on a freshly paved smooth asphalt road according to the commercial. The wood planks were cushioned completely.  Actually, I don\\'t remember them (depending on how long ago that was - I\\'m turning 20 this month). Having driven in my ex-girlfriend\\'s family car (Lexus GX470) with the suspension even set to the Sportiest setting (it was 4-mode adjustable), it was very smooth and creamy. It also drove like a truck that was bigger than it was, which is how the Camry drove to me. The Accord is the other way around, though, it drives \"small.\"  Elroy,I concur. I am actually starting to think there is something wrong with mine and the way the sway bars are connected or something. In any event, some H&R \"OE\" style springs should help also. They are conceptually very similar to the Neuspeed \"soft-sport\" springs - only lower the car very slightly and give it a small bump in spring rate. Still a good ride trade off and plenty of clearance for driveway dips and snow.   Legacy has a litle sharper handling, yes, at the expense of a harsher ride. More steering feel perhaps if you like feeling every bump in the road. Grippier tires? Maybe, I haven\\'t tested the Sonata and Legacy back to back in an obstacle course. I like the brake feel of the Sonata and to me it has a bigger greenhouse (except for the Legacy wagon/Outback) and it plenty airy. Legacy has the standout feature of AWD of course, rare in this class.I think the Sonata is superior in interior room and comfort, ride, NVH, fuel economy, warranty and value.  I think the Sonata is superior in interior room and comfort, ride, NVH, fuel economy, warranty and value. Except fot the warranty, interior room and maybe value, all subjective matters, I don\\'t disagree. But NVH? I\\'ve seen a lot of long term reviews of the Sonata where they\\'ve reamed it because of the thuds and discomforts. And the fuel economy of the V6 seems below average to that of the Accord.The front end is aweful looking too.  This thread is on Legacy vs. Sonata. I\\'ve driven both and to me the Sonata is much quieter (less road noise and engine noise) and smoother. I\\'ve driven several Sonatas on long trips and never had any \"thuds\" or discomforts, although you can hear the big joints/tar strips on freeways.Fuel economy is an objective measure--easy to compare the numbers. And I am pretty sure the Sonata\\'s numbers are better than those of the Legacy.Front end styling is subjective, no?  Front end styling is subjective, no? My own subjective opinion is that the front end styling of the Accord is far more awful than that of the Sonata (which I don\\'t actually find to be awful at all).  Front end styling is subjective, no?The Ford Fusion has, by far, the best front end styling, IMHO. Yes, we own one, a 2007 SEL AWD. Fine automobile. Handles like a go-cart and is loaded with amenities.  A nice car for sure, however didn\\'t rate nearly as high in Consumer Reports as my Altima. Also a 2007 SE!?!??!?  think the Sonata is superior in interior room and comfort, ride, NVH, fuel economy, warranty and value.I think some of those items are subjective. I actually find the seats of the Legacy much more comfortable and supportive than the Sonata. I find the ride quality of the Sonata, eh, limp. FE is 23/30 to 24/34, although I seem to regularly beat that highway estimate.I think Subaru discontinued the wagon for \\'08, which I think is sad, because I previously thought that was one of the standout features for the class, since none of the other midsizers come as a wagon.I actually like hte NVH characteristics of the Subaru. Once underway its quiet but I like that you can feel a little kick when you turn the engine on. I noticed the new Accord actually does this too.Value...well that depends how you measure what is important to you. I think having a 30 mpg AWD wagon with a stick is very important, and getting 16\" alloy wheels, trip computer, compass mirror and all the other goodies were just a bonus, especially for under 20k.  $395 and available on \\'08 Fusions by the end of this year. http://www.ford.com/en/company/syncMoreAffordableThanEver.htmSince it does most of what OnStar does will GM stop charging for the subscription? Or maybe offer different levels?  Front end styling is subjective, no?Absolutely. And since I\\'m never gonna buy a car that I don\\'t like the looks of its a lock that I wouldn\\'t buy a Sonata today. I think they\\'re way behind in the style department.I\\'d bet a huge amount of buyers purchase a car based on looks ALONE.  I don\\'t see how bluetooth connectivity and support for MP3 player in any way challenges the business model for OnStar at this point. They serve different functions. As far as I can tell, it doesn\\'t do anything OnStar does.

The Accord you\\'re posting is a 6 year old design. The 2008 looks sweet.Stats are misleading. You don\\'t hear mag editors talking about the odd thumping on an Accord like they do a Sonata. I\\'m not talking dbs. I\\'m talking the V and H, something Hyundai needs to fix on this car.  How\\'s that Sonata resale value holding up?  Consider this . . . how much does one typically pay for an Accord EX-L V6?You can buy a Sonata Limited V6 with Leather for $17,500, including incentives, not including TTL. Some folks can withstand the higher depreciation rate when you\\'re able to buy a car for such a price.  Did you guys look at the \\'08/\\'09 Mazda6? Mazda might have a potential winner on their hands!Teaser snap  Actually we did... a couple of days ago. mz6greyghost, \"Midsize Sedans 2.0\" #3922, 7 Aug 2007 6:50 am  No revelation about it. I just prefer the cleaner design of the Sonata. To each own. The photo I posted is the 07 Accord, I don\\'t care how old the design is, if I am a perspective shopper of the two, those two would be on the lot for purchase at present time.The 08 Accord to my eyes, at least the front end, resembles somewhat to the current Sonata, especially the headlight.Stats are misleadingBelieve what you want to believe. It\\'s funny how cars like the Sonata, when it performs well in various areas, you\\'d get comments like this from the naysayers. When it\\'s the other way around, well, everything seems to be invisible. The Accord is a competent car, the Sonata is a competent. Appreciate the choices you have out there, only when you have competitions out there, the vehicles keep improving.  The 08 Accord to my eyes, at least the front end, resembles somewhat to the current SonataInteresting observation considering most people thought the Sonata snagged the Accord\\'s rear and tailights for their \"new\" design. You know what they say about imitation.I do realize that all these cars do share a lot of styling cues. How can\\'t they? But Hyundai just doesn\\'t seem to attend the 21\\'st century design school like the others in this comparo.Even the Azera is a yawner. I think the Genesis has potential.  Up until next year, the Mazda6 still has 3 body styles: sedan, hatchback (some call this a 5-door), and a wagon. The Legacy was on my short list not only because of AWD and a fun driving GT, but also because of the wagon option. In the past I had an Accord hatchback and a Legacy wagon and found the extra hauling capacity handy not only for work but also for moving larger items... and even for taking naps on long road trips :blush: It\\'s too bad the Legacy and Mazda6 won\\'t be making their wagons anymore, but with the Outback and CX-7, there\\'s still good alternatives for buyers of both brands. So from a practical/utility perspective, the Mazda6 and the Passat will be the only cars in this class that will have an expanded cargo carrying capacity over a standard sedan... too bad too, I\\'d think the average person/family would find extra hauling space would be a good feature that would take away the appeal from heavier and less efficient SUV\\'s which are also more rollover prone.  Then you should like the snout of the 2009 Sonata, due this spring; it\\'s reported to be inspired by the Genesis.If you think the Sebring and Avenger attend the 21st century design school, then... well, there\\'s no hope for you, I\\'m afraid.   Here is something the 2008 Accord won\\'t have but the 2008 Fusion will.http://blip.tv/file/299867  Do you know what the 08 Accord will, or will not have? I guess if the buyer is more interested in gadgets, than the car itself, sync could be a plus. IMO there are already too many gadgets to take the driver\\'s mind off what he/she should be concentrating on, DRIVING.  I\\'d bet a huge amount of buyers purchase a car based on looks ALONEYou\\'re right, and that\\'s the reason why I got the 2007 Sonata SE :shades: I\\'d say the:bang-for-the-buck price i.e. most number of standard features on a mid-variant modelbetter-than-competetion warranty & interior spacecompetent power,fuel consumption, NVH, comfort & handlingare simply bonuses. Besides, the chances that my car will be vandalized or stolen are less, since i got such a no-name-brand car. :blush: I\\'m happy with my purchase and i couldn\\'t care less for those who are nit-picking. I owned Honda\\'s & Toyota\\'s and I wish their followers don\\'t convert to Hyundai like me bcoz it might drive Hyundai\\'s prices up :surprise: Our next target purchase: either a Santa Fe or a Veracruz   \"I\\'d bet a huge amount of buyers purchase a car based on looks ALONE\"I couldn\\'t disagree more this statement. A car has to has form and function, such as the BMW 335. If not form and function than function, such as the Aztec.I would never buy a daily beater based on looks alone.  I know that Ford has an exclusive on Sync for at least a year so it\\'s guaranteed that no other mfr will offer Sync. So from that standpoint yes, I know for a fact the 08 accord won\\'t have it.Having voice and manual control via the radio of both the phone and mp3 player is safer than trying to use these devices manually. If the situation was reversed and the Camcord had that feature I\\'m sure we\\'d be hearing a totally different tune. Didn\\'t we hear the same thing about AWD? I guess is the Accord doesn\\'t have it then nobody needs it - right?  You can buy a Sonata Limited V6 with Leather for $17,500, including incentivesYes, those who harp on resale value seem to forget that the \"depreciation\" that comes before you buy is not a cost to the buyer. My mazda6 depreciated by $5000 before I bought it, according to the way some seem to look at this.I think looks can end up being a deciding factor, because the other differences are minor. For instance I could have been comfortable driving an Accord or a Mazda6, but one of the main reasons I bought the 6 is because I think it looks better.It is nice that it looks so good while I am walking to it, because it takes me a long time to get to my car...weighed down, as I am, with a much heavier wallet than I would have had I bought an Accord  .  \"Having voice and manual control via the radio of both the phone and mp3 player is safer than trying to use these devices manually.\"Huh, I disagree 100% about voice. I would not want to interact vocally with my radio. Pressing a button on the steering wheel is about as safe as you can get in terms of fiddling with the radio. By the time I say 101.5 I could have pressed the button three times.  Are you sure you can buy a Sonato for Limited V6 for that price? The sticker is over $23,000 and that is well below sticker.  Yep, got that exact price quote last week from a local dealer.  We\\'re talking about using a MP3 player or manually dialing a phone - you can\\'t do that with a steering wheel control. It requires multiple button presses either on the phone or the MP3 player which Sync eliminates. Saying \"play track Freebird\" is infinitely safer than scrolling through Ipod menus to find it. Same with looking at your phone to find a contact to call.Why can\\'t you just admit this is a very nice feature instead of looking for ways to bash it just because it\\'s a Ford feature?  \"Why can\\'t you just admit this is a very nice feature instead of looking for ways to bash it just because it\\'s a Ford feature? \"Because I don\\'t go in for that type of stuff on a car. To me I would still get the Accord, without AWD and without this feature.Handsfree bluetooth is a must if one is to be in compliance with the cell phone laws in a number of states.  Handsfree bluetooth is a must if one is to be in compliance with the cell phone laws in a number of states.Actually the laws aren\\'t that well written. A crummy wired ear-piece is all you need to be in compliance with the laws.   \"Actually the laws aren\\'t that well written. A crummy wired ear-piece is all you need to be in compliance with the laws.\"Actually no, because in some states you are not allowed to remove your hand from the wheel to dial or hangup the phone. So if you can do this from your crummy wired ear-piece you would be in compliance to the law.  So why not just say \"it\\'s a nice feature but I wouldn\\'t want it\"?As I stated before - anything the Accord doesn\\'t have must not be worth having. Unbelievable.  in some states you are not allowed to remove your hand from the wheel to dial or hangup the phone. I\\'ve never seen such a specific restriction. Considering you remove your hand from the wheel all the time to change radio stations or climate control I don\\'t see how you could enact something that much more restrictive just for cell phones. Care to post a link to one of those laws?  \"So why not just say \"it\\'s a nice feature but I wouldn\\'t want it\"?\"I say the same thing about the crap they load up BMWs with.  Just because YOU don\\'t want it doesn\\'t mean it isn\\'t important to other people.I know people who could care less about handling but would kill for more gadgets. Does that make either of you wrong? Of course not.  \"I know people who could care less about handling but would kill for more gadgets. Does that make either of you wrong? Of course not.\"But what it means is that when I buy a car, gadgets don\\'t mean anything. There are people who buy a car based on gadgets to the dollar, that is not me. It\\'s not about being right or wrong, it\\'s about the way I buy cars and what I look for. When someone posts that car x has a nine-gigabyte hard drive, I say so what, but others go ohh and ahh.  I wish that FoMoCo, instead of spending all that money developing Sync with Microsoft, has instead devoted it to making a more economical engine. Our 2007 3.0-liter, 221-horsepower V6 SEL AWD Fusion gets 14.8 mpg in all-city driving and 24 mpg on the highway at 55-60 mph. The revised EPA estimate for this power train is 17 mpg city and 24 mpg highway.I could care less about about gadgets like Sync but do care about mileage. I\\'m sure that there must be a demand for such technology or Ford wouldn\\'t have invested in it. But, do we really want to turn our cars into computers more so than they are already?I\\'m pretty much a basic transportation guy when it comes to vehicles and like our 2000 Focus station wagon just as much as I do our $27,105 MSRP Fusion. Power steering, power brakes, air conditioning, an automatic transmission and I am happy. Heck, the Focus even has crank windows.The bells and whistles trend has far exceeded its usefulness as far as I\\'m concerned and the Sync idea is nothing more than a gimmick that\\'s likely to go on the fritz in very short order, IMHO.Call me old school, but cars were made for commuting not computing.  I\\'m very impressed with that video showing the capabilities of Sync. Of course, I\\'m 26 years old, and am a huge technology fan. I don\\'t spend that much time in a car, so most of my technology is related to other things (example, my car is pretty spartan; but I have GPS tracking and navigation in my new wristwatch (Garmin Forerunner 305), so I can use it anywhere, especially running and biking).What really intruiges me about Sync is that it will be upgradeable with new software packages in the future. Compared to other options available in cars today, that makes it much more appealing. If you are planning on keeping the car for a while, it is nice to know that your high-tech features won\\'t be out of date in a year or two. A few years is a long time in the technology world, and something brand new may come onto the market that appeals to you. All you\\'ll have to do is download the latest patch, and whatever hot new high-tech gadget you want in 5 years will likely be able to \"Sync\" with your car.Pretty cool.  Call me old school, but cars were made for commuting not computing.I guess I\\'m old school too. My Accord has a six CD changer, but 99.9% of the time I\\'m listening to my favorite local radio station (Walton & Johnson in the morning and classic rock all day). My nieces a nefews have all these gadgets, and seems to me they are just toys. The play with them, and play with them, but never really just listen to the music. They spend way more time downloading music than they do listening to it :confuse:. I don\\'t see the need for it.  \"I\\'m 26 years old, and am a huge technology fan.\"I\\'m a tech fan too, but with cars I believe the technology should go into making the car better to drive. Yes, I love a good stereo, I\\'d like to be able to plug in an mp3 flash drive. But I wouldn\\'t make a purchase decision on a cars entertainment center or other gadgets.  I\\'m all for gadgets if it helps keeps my loved ones and I safe. So I\\'m all for the latest safety wizardry such as ESC, ABS with Brake Assist, active head restraints, side curtains, etc. I\\'ve also become accustomed to certain creature comforts over the years; power windows, locks, mirrors, and remote locking are something I won\\'t do without on a 4-door car. And I\\'m a real fan of flexible driving positions via seat adjustments (love those dual height adjusters or power ones, and telescopic wheels). Little things that improve passenger comfort are nice, too: center armrests, padded armrests (amazing how even some cars in this class fall down there), lighted vanity mirrors, lots of storage pockets, lots of foot room under the front seats, etc. Other than that, the rest is gravy. Don\\'t need audio controls on the wheel (they\\'re not bad, but I really can do without them). Don\\'t need nav. Don\\'t need Bluetooth (although I can appreciate it). Really don\\'t need a 500 petabyte audio system with built-in data warehouse. Don\\'t need a computer that is too smart for its own good (ala iDrive). Don\\'t need DVD screens (I can always bring along my $80 DVD player if we\\'re on a long trip). Don\\'t need LED lights all over the place, or an auto climate control, or push-button starter.Hard to bellieve my first car, the mid-sized \\'66 Dodge Coronet, had no carpet, no radio, no A/C, no power anything (except brakes I think), and a 3-speed automatic. But we got by. Really easy to work on that slant 6 engine, though--lots of room in the engnie bay!   Your thoughts are along the same thoughts as mine. I don\\'t call power windows, seats, or door locks gadgets though. Most cars except for the cheapest of the cheap come with them anyway. Climate control makes life easier in the cabin, don\\'t need dual controls though. Don\\'t even need cruise. I like the audio controls on the steering wheel, aids in the prevention of distraction from fiddling with the radio. Don\\'t believe in XM/Sirius or NAV. VZ Nav is way cheaper and can be used on foot or bicycle. I\\'ll take leather although leatherette is fine. In this segment, I would want a decent car for family transportation, some amount of creature comforts, efficient, yet lively engine.IMO, when one moves up to LS460 or 750 class it comes with the gadgets. Drove the 750 and it comes with a dizzying array of gadgets, maybe too many. But when you spend $90K for a car that\\'s what you expect and that\\'s what you get.  &#147;I am struggling with the trend to make everything bigger. The Civic is about the same size as my old Accord&#148;What I find troublesome, except for the Civic and Corolla, mileage for growing subcompacts has skidded down from early 1990s ratings of 31/37 in many cases to 24/32. This is CamCord/Sonata/Optima 4-cylinder mileage territory. Subcompacts that used to weigh 2100&#150;2300# now are now nudging 3000#. The latest Jetta has gone past it now (3230 MT) and is almost the same tonnage as an I4 Sonata (3253 MT). The new Rabbit with a 5-cylinder is rated @22/30. I have read a test where drivers only averaged 19 mpg, another just over 25. At around $3 a gallon and nearly 20k purchase price, what kind of economy car is that? I am aware that these cars have more &#145;stuff&#146; on them, and didn&#146;t accelerate so well, but how about a 2600# subcompact?The 2005 (I think) remake of the Malibu added about 3 mpg. That will be lost in the 2008 conversion to the longer-wheelbase chassis. The new revised mileage ratings will send it down further. Another thing: does everybody have to go from 0-60 in 7 seconds or less? 8 seconds is quite adequate for a lot of people, I think. &#147;the Accord is bigger than the 80s Crown Vics.&#148;On this point, I think you are confused. The LTD began in 1965. The incarnation you referred to started in 1979 as the Galaxie/LTD. It was around 214\" overall length. I don&#146;t know of any Accord that big. Ford did bring out a Fairmount-based vehicle called the LTD in the early 1980s, as a precursor to the Taurus. This may be what you are thinking of. I think the Crown Victoria label was lifted from a fancy 1950s Fairlane to differentiate from its lesser stablemate.  I\\'m with you when it comes to my commuter car. I picked up a low end Altima 2.5S with no other options, but ABS. Didn\\'t want or need to all the gadgets on the higher trims. However, you listed out exactly what you want and need, but you still purchased the \\'SEL\\' trim? You could of picked up a base \\'S\\' model or the \\'SE\\' trim if you really needed AWD and/or a V6, which according to you, not really needed from your list of must haves. FWD cars will get better mpg vs. their AWD counterparts. Ford offers low end trims w/o all the toys like every other brand, yet you choose the top of the line trim. Your list of priorities and complaints would of made the Fusion I-4S, your \"dream\" car, yet you chose the top of the line V6 (your mpg complaint), AWD (your mpg complaint), and the SEL trim (your too many gadgets complaint).I\\'m not following your logic.  Your list of priorities and complaints would of made the Fusion I-4S, your \"dream\" car, yet you chose the top of the line V6 (your mpg complaint), AWD (your mpg complaint), and the SEL trim (your too many gadgets complaint).I\\'m not following your logic.Truth is we made an illogical buying decision which I now regret. The wife was a critical factor: Wanted a moon roof. I wanted leather seating. The six-disc, six-speaker CD/radio seemed nice (but we only use the radio). A power driver\\'s seat is handy when you have two drivers.We didn\\'t order the car; it was on the lot. In retrospect, an S with an I4 automatic would have been just fine. I have buyer\\'s remorse. The mileage is horrific and we seldom use, or appreciate, all of the bells and whistles.I thought we \"needed\" a V6 because I4s are traditionally anemic. That, too, was a mistake. The AWD is totally uncalled for in our climate. Again, the car came that way.We did not make a wise decision, but the car is a fine automobile which has many nice features and nary a squeak or rattle one after eight months and 4,204 miles.  We did not make a wise decision, but the car is a fine automobile which has many nice features and nary a squeak or rattle one after eight months and 4,204 miles.And your fusion is a daily driver too right? That\\'s about 10 miles each way per trip? No wonder your gas mileage is so bad...your car is barely warming up before you\\'ve arrived. Add to this situation you\\'re doing city driving with some stop and go, and no wonder your mileage is so dismal. I have a similar engine as you with lots of stop and go on my commute in all city driving, but with a longer overall drive and I\\'m getting 19 mpg even when I\\'m \"stretching out the car\\'s legs\" pretty frequently.  I\\'m a tech fan too, but with cars I believe the technology should go into making the car better to drive. Yes, I love a good stereo, I\\'d like to be able to plug in an mp3 flash drive. But I wouldn\\'t make a purchase decision on a cars entertainment center or other gadgets.But when you\\'re at the point in your buying making process where you\\'ve narrowed down your short list to a few vehicles, these extras can make a difference. Of course if you save a lot of money buying one of those vehicles, the money you save can often buy those options that the car you choose didn\\'t come with from the factory... just like the savings on my car over the next car on my list (6spd honda accord) bought my plasma tv, a DSLR, my GPS/mp3 player, an mp3 input device that I installed in my center console and paid for my car insurance for a year and a half :P  I think looks can end up being a deciding factor, because the other differences are minor. For instance I could have been comfortable driving an Accord or a Mazda6, but one of the main reasons I bought the 6 is because I think it looks better.It is nice that it looks so good while I am walking to it, because it takes me a long time to get to my car...weighed down, as I am, with a much heavier wallet than I would have had I bought an AccordI agree completely... although the main reasons I bought this car did not involve how the car looked, I still get a certain amount of satisfaction when a stranger walks by and tells me that I have a nice looking car or something to that effect. And it happens pretty frequently too. I think it\\'s great that every time I walk up to my car to go for a drive I\\'m thinking, \"That\\'s a good looking car. Glad it\\'s mine!!\"  \"But when you\\'re at the point in your buying making process where you\\'ve narrowed down your short list to a few vehicles, these extras can make a difference.\"I see what you are getting to, but I don\\'t buy cars like that. I figure out what car I want, then what options I want or don\\'t. If it came push to shove, I certainly wouldn\\'t get the car I wanted if it had more bells and whistles, but I don\\'t go looking for cars with the most gadgets.  Call me old school, but cars were made for commuting not computingThere\\'s deffinitly an age component to it. by the same token, I\\'d be willing to be you also wouldn\\'t plunk down $600 for an iphone, and niether would I. But those gizmo\\'s and gadgets can separate one car from the other, and for the buyer who isn\\'t really concerned with price, or rather value, It can make the difference in what they buy. The various fan boys of each model can say what they want, most of the cars in this segment are nearly identical performance, handling and reliability wise. Sure, an enthusiast will notice the subtle differences, but the majority of drivers, in bumper to bumper traffic, never will. To me, honda is deffinitly making a bad call if they ignore the tech stuff. Thats the way the market is going, and what the younger buyers will demand. They, along with toyota, will be fine for the next 20-30 years, but the 20 somethings out there now will begin to view the accord and camry as \"grandpa\\'s car\" and look for cars with the gadgets and stuff they want. The asian car companies got where they are today in no small part by always innovating and adding value to their vehicles. I think if they loose that sense of giving you more than you asked for, and stuff not found on other cars, In 20 years we may be discussing what toyota and honda have to do to get back on top of the market.  \"adding value to their vehicles\"Exactly and that is the essense of the conversation. What is value to one is not value to another. In this sense I take it to mean value is: relative worth, merit, or importance. Some people place value on gadgets, some don\\'t. Some people place value on the drive and performance, some don\\'t.  I think we are in agreement...most of the decisions I will make about a car purchase is about how the car drives and how it fits my needs/wants (ie bodystyle). The rest is only an issue if all else is mostly equal. I find it interesting that Nissan has decided their signature/headline feature on the new Altima is a push-start button... their marketing must have found that most people are not like us.  Some people place value on gadgets, some don\\'tI never disputed that. What I\\'m saying is, in the not so distant future, the majority of car buyers will place a lot of value on gadgets. car manufactures ignore that at their own perril. To someone over 30, it doesn\\'t mean much. To the kids out there learning how to drive right now, not having some of those \"gadgets\" will seem as alien to them as a car not having AC does to us older drivers. Their and others desire for tech is already showing up. Take the altima, since I\\'m posting and reading through that forum, the fully loaded, all the bells and whisles, version of the sedan and coupe are the hardest to find. despite the fact all the gadgets can push the price up over 30k. I don\\'t fault honda, toyota, or any other manufacturer for going after the 40+ buyers, they are the largest demographic buying midsize sedans. But, if they don\\'t cater enough to the younger drivers (their future customers) I think its going to cost them down the road.  The Altima has a CVT which I bet is limiting the sales. I for one was not impressed with CVT. And that emergency foot operated brake, is in a very strange place. Looks to me to be odd, and I wonder if the leg hits it in an accident. No, I want the emergency brake near my right hand, thank you. The push to start / stop, I guess is OK. So what does the key or whatever it is called now that it is StarTrek transmitter age device, cost if it should break or become lost? I miss the days of the .97 keysLoren  So with these new Altimas, if you want to turn off the engine, and just listen to the radio (or whatever) how does that work. Does the button turn everything off, or just the engine?  Limiting the sales? have you looked at the numbers for it? sales of the 07 altima are more than 20% over last years. it (+ the versa) is the reason nissan was just about the only auto company to post a sales gain for july.  if you push the button once, the car shuts off, no different that removing a conventional key. if (while running) you push it twice in sucession, the car cuts off, but everything else stays on. no pause in the radio, or anything. the motor just stops.and before you ask, no, the car will not shut off if you push the button while it is moving. nothing happens unless you hold it in for about 5 seconds or so.  the cvt is nothing less than amazing. can cruis at 75 mph and only 2200 rpm. give it about 1/2 throttle, and it will instantly, smothly, without any kind of jerk, jump to about 5000-5500 rpm and get you to whatever speed you want in a very short time. deffinitly takes some getting used too, especialy the car getting used to you (it will learn your driving style and behave accordingly) but once you get used to it, and it gets used to you; it\\'s hard to imagine driving anything else.  I don\\'t see how bluetooth connectivity and support for MP3 player in any way challenges the business model for OnStar at this point. They serve different functions. As far as I can tell, it doesn\\'t do anything OnStar does. Voice recognition. Both have it and it is the most used feature of OnStar I\\'d wager. How often do you have to call for an emergency and how often do you talk on the phone or change the radio station/volume? The similarities are there.  IMO there are already too many gadgets to take the driver\\'s mind off what he/she should be concentrating on, DRIVING. Have you sat in a new Acura SUV yet? Tiny buttons everywere and they are all the same shape, size, and color. All of them are for the overabundance of gadgets everyone desires. I\\'m with you though. My Mustang is all about the drive and I am very seldom distracted by any gadgets. It doesn\\'t even have steering wheel mounted audio controls. Albeit because of the retro design.  Have you sat in a new Acura SUV yet? Tiny buttons everywere and they are all the same shape, size, and color. All of them are for the overabundance of gadgets everyone desires. Not everyone. The only reason I would think about buying an Acura TL is either for the performance or the looks. The performance is not that much better than an Accord V6, and I\\'m not all that concerned with looks. For these reasons I don\\'t have an Acura, and don\\'t plan on buying one. It\\'s just extra money for things I don\\'t want. The gadget junkies can buy the TSX or TL. Leave the Accord simple, I say.  I see alot has happened since my \"POST #20\" about 4007 messages ago...OH I agree! I think its ok to update the accord with some new gadgets that the camry and altima have like Keyless go on the EX models. The big red button from the s2000 is a start but maybe something more contemporary would work well here.IMO, the TSX should be refreshed and do a 6 year cycle. Bring it out about the same time as the next A4. The current A4 is a refresh. The TL... RWD. I finally made up my mind! RWD!! Yeah, not going to happen... I say make another acura model. Let the TL be a GS competitor but being a tad more sporty than luxurious like the GS and the new model [Lets say XL] to be like the ES. The RL just needs to retire or go on hiatus.With all this money honda and Acura are making with all this sales gains, they should really put some into a 4th platform and V8 engine. Seriously, other than being lost in RL, where is this money going? I rarely see honda commercials! The only1 i know features MR. Opportunity and thats 1 a year.IMO, its time for acura to do like their slogan... ADVANCE!!-Cj   OK. I personally like the jerk, or kick when you get a shift, over say the electric cart feel. Do see how it could be efficient. So sales are up? I see some around here in the new model, but had no idea they are selling more. Was 2006 model year really slow for sales? It is good that they have some style, and are not bland looking. Altima is pretty sharp.Loren  Actually, I prefer a stick too, (its what my other 2 cars have) but that doesn\\'t make the CVT any less amazing. To me, there\\'s just something about having almost complete control over the transmission. but thats comparing to a stick, to compare it to an auto, to me, it isn\\'t even close. when I drive my altima, the difference is so profound its kinda hard to describe. I guess my only preference for the stick is more or less feel over function. some CVT\\'s have a \"go cart\" feel to them, but not the xtronic. Its usually reffered to a a \"rubberband\" feel, and I\\'ve heard some sentra owners complain of that.As for the sales, 06 was probably off from 05, but wasn\\'t terrible. the altima has always been a top 5 car since the redesign back in 02 that brought it into the midsize family.The 07 redesign finnaly made it capable of competing with the accord and camry. Before 07, it lacked the interior, and build quality to stand toe to toe.  The wife was a critical factorLOL. I fully understand urnews. I\\'ve had the same issue with past car purchases. I figured that was part of it, but didn\\'t want to put words in your mouth. What can you do, gotta keep the wife happy.  The CVT on the Altima is absolutely amazing. That was one of the selling points for me. It is unbelievely smooth and efficient. I\\'m averaging 24 mpg all city w/ only 600 miles so far and the I4 matched with CVT is powerful and butter smooth.The start button is a cool feature, but 5 weeks into my ownership. The novelty has worn off a bit. That said, as simple as taking your keys out of your pocket and turning the ignition. It\\'s been nice not messing with the keys. But I do worry at times about what would happen if the Intellikey decides to de program itself and I can\\'t start the car since there is no slot for the physical key.Nissan decided to provide a slot for the Intellikey if the battery dies in the FOB. There is an actual key inside the FOB you slide out to use to unlock the doors and then slide the FOB into the slot and start the car. However, if the Intellikey just stopped working, you\\'re SOL until your wife/hubby can swing by with the spare. You\\'d think the engineers would have provided a way to use the key to start the car if needed. I think this will keep many people away from a great car otherwise.  The Altima has a CVT which I bet is limiting the sales. I for one was not impressed with CVT.I don\\'t think this is the case, I think people tend to like it better because of the smoothness and the ability to always stay in its powerband or efficiency band. Of all the CVTs, I think Nissan has the best implementation. I am not in the market as I prefer a manual transmission, but when I test drove the Altima they only had a CVT.The push to start / stop, I guess is OK. So what does the key or whatever it is called now that it is StarTrek transmitter age device, cost if it should break or become lost? I miss the days of the .97 keys I think the value goes up the first time you run up to the car in the pouring rain with your arms full and don\\'t have to fumble for your keys to load it or drive away. I\\'m pretty frugal but that was one of the features I really liked about the MIL\\'s Prius.  It probably runs about $100-150 per key. Thats what a neighbor of mine that used to work as a tec for toyota told me they charged to replace and reprogram fob\\'s. to me the real downside of it is, if you want a third key, you can\\'t just get another one programed, you have to get 3 new keys.  But I do worry at times about what would happen if the Intellikey decides to de program itself and I can\\'t start the car since there is no slot for the physical key. thats pretty unlikely. Fobs arn\\'t new, they\\'ve been around in luxury cars for awhile now. you just have to be a little carefull with it. keep it away from magnets, microwaves, water.......the standard list for most things electronic. and of course, untill the new fobs are issued, your cell phone. :P  It probably runs about $100-150 per key. Thats what a neighbor of mine that used to work as a tec for toyota told me they charged to replace and reprogram fob\\'s. to me the real downside of it is, if you want a third key, you can\\'t just get another one programed, you have to get 3 new keys.With the Accord he told me I had to bring all the existing keys in addition to what ever new ones I was adding as they all had to get programmed at once, but they they would all work.  that sounds right, I can\\'t remember if he told me they were reprogamable or not, and that was toyota. I do remember him telling me it was a real pain in the [non-permissible content removed] though. Had to go through a lot of steps that had to be done exactly right, in an exact order to do it. But again, that could just be a toyota thing.  I remember reading on this forum that several people had mentioned that they thought the interior of the Mazda6 was a bit tight compared to the other cars in this category. Personally, I\\'ve had several 6 footers in the back without issue and have rode in the back myself without having a feeling of claustrophobia but since so many people were saying it, I either took them at their word or didn\\'t really care since I had never had a problem with the interior dimensions of the Mazda6. On occasion these comments were coming from Accord proponents so I thought I\\'d take a peak at this allegation. Here\\'s what I found (according to Honda and Mazda official websites):Headroom (in., front / rear): Accord (EX w/sunroof) - 38.3 / 36.8. Mazda6 5dr(w/sunroof) - 38.0 / 36.7.Legroom (in., front / rear): Accord - 42.6 / 36.8. Mazda6 5dr - 42.3 / 36.5. Hiproom (in., front / rear): Accord - 54.6 / 53.5. Mazda6 5dr - 54.7 / 54.1.Shoulder Room (in., front / rear): Accord - 56.9 / 56.1. Mazda6 5dr - 56.1 / 54.9Cargo Volume (cu. ft.): Accord - 14.0. Mazda6 5dr - 22.1 (58.7 with rear seats folded down). The strange thing is, I never hear that the Accord is cramped or small, but I hear that alot when the 6 is described.... perhaps people are using overall interior space to come up with their conclusions, but if that volume includes area where people don\\'t reside or use (like under the windshield above the dash), who cares? I guess this confirms what I was thinking before, the Mazda6 has enough room for most people to be comfortable and is competitive for this class.  Why are you comparing a hatchback with a sedan?How about apples to apples? I\\'d avoid a hatchback because of the lessened structural rigidity (more rattles) since I will keep a car a long time.  It\\'s how the space is used. Somehow it\\'s used more effectively in an Accord. (imo)  Nissan decided to provide a slot for the Intellikey if the battery dies in the FOB... However, if the Intellikey just stopped working, you\\'re SOL until your wife/hubby can swing by with the spare.Not from what I understand. If the \"key\" does have a malfunction, the car can sense it, and flashes a warning on the trip computer. This allows you to still run the car with the fob in the slot to the left of the steering wheel. This is from what I understand from the owners manual.  \"I see what you are getting to, but I don\\'t buy cars like that. I figure out what car I want, then what options I want or don\\'t. If it came push to shove, I certainly wouldn\\'t get the car I wanted if it had more bells and whistles, but I don\\'t go looking for cars with the most gadgets.\"So unexciting. I can see you in the dealership waiting 5 months for your custom built driving appliance. I started to buy the stripped model (Mazda 3i) but drove in a loaded S with every option when all was said and done. What did it? Electroluminescent (sp?) gauges and two-tone seats. And the Ford Sync is a $395 option. pay it and have fun.  I used to think the Mazda6 was tight in back, but recently I sat in a car with the power driver\\'s seat, and when I adjusted it so it was fairly high up (for good thigh support), I was also able to move it prety far forward and be comfortable. (I\\'m 5\\'10\".) At that setting, there was plenty of room in the back seat for me, and there was good foot room since the front seat was so high. So I think numbers can be misleading wrt actual stretch-out room in back. A lot depends on the seat geometry, amount of toe space, etc. The Accord also has pretty good rear leg room, but feels claustrophobic to me (especially with the black interior) compared to some other cars in this class such as Camry, Optima, and Sonata.  Why are you comparing a hatchback with a sedan? It doesn\\'t change much, here is sedan to sedan comparison:Headroom (in., front / rear): Accord (EX w/sunroof) - 38.3 / 36.8. Mazda6 Sedan(w/sunroof) - 38.0 / 37.1. Legroom (in., front / rear): Accord - 42.6 / 36.8. Mazda6 Sedan - 42.3 / 36.5. Hiproom (in., front / rear): Accord - 54.6 / 53.5. Mazda6 Sedan - 54.7 / 54.1. Shoulder Room (in., front / rear): Accord - 56.9 / 56.1. Mazda6 Sedan - 55.9 / 55.2 Cargo Volume (cu. ft.): Accord - 14.0. Mazda6 Sedan - 15.2Also if you compare independent measurements by CR, there is not much difference either.  \"So unexciting\"Yep and that\\'s me. If I\\'m dumping $20K - $45K large on something, I want what I want and want how I want it.  We\\'re the same in this area.I\\'m the same way. If i went to buy a car and had a choice between all theoptions i\\'d want on a silver car or most the options i want on the color I\\'d want, I\\'d rather give the dealer my information (and risk millons of calls) and order the car precisely how i\\'d want it.I hate silver cars. I like green(VW, BMW, Acura, honda green. Not SAAB green or lime/neon green) or browns.For some reason, when i build a car on the manufacturers website, I never see it at dealers. BUT! Other people seem to be driving it around!-Cj  LOL. I fully understand urnews. I\\'ve had the same issue with past car purchases. I figured that was part of it, but didn\\'t want to put words in your mouth. What can you do, gotta keep the wife happy.Actually, she had her heart set on a new Mustang, but that was just too impractical for our present circumstances. We traded in a 2000 Mazda Miata MX-5 convertible with only 7,500 miles on it.The problem with gadgets, bell and whistles, is when they cease to function properly and have to be fixed. It\\'s often very expensive to fix a gadget.The Fusion, after eight months and 4,200 miles, has been perfect in that regard but who knows what the future will bring?Our lone complaint is poor gas mileage, but even our 2000 Ford Focus station wagon with a 2.0-liter I4 and automatic transmission only gets 18-20 mpg driving the same route so I guess the Fusion\\'s 14.8 mpg isn\\'t all that bad considering it is a 3,300-pound mid-size sedan with a V6 and AWD.Still, I think FoMoCo would be better served if it devoted more resources toward better fuel economy rather than gadgets like Sync  The Fusion, after eight months and 4,200 miles, has been perfect in that regard but who knows what the future will bring?525 miles a month? I hope you have no issues. Try 525+ miles a week in your car and see where you stand down the road. Not picking on you, but my Ford experiences say high miles and Ford don\\'t mix.  I found an artist rendering of the new Mazda 6. I guess we\\'ll have to see.http://www.worldcarfans.com/6070730.001/new-mazda6-latest-artists-renderings  Try 525+ miles a week in your car and see where you stand down the road. Not picking on you, but my Ford experiences say high miles and Ford don\\'t mix.2 Escorts, a Contour and a Focus have done fine. Maybe you just got BadEggs.  \"Not picking on you, but my Ford experiences say high miles and Ford don\\'t mix.\"LOL, my Ford experiences say LOW miles and Ford don\\'t mix.(Former 2004 Explorer, and to some degree our present 2004 Mustang).  So, the 6 has more hiproom, but less shoulder room and legroom. The Accord feels more \"airy\" and roomy to me, but its something intangible that I can\\'t really back up, so I won\\'t try to.  The Accord\\'s back seat is not the roomiest in this segment, that\\'s for sure. In front however it is as comfortable as it gets. I love the driver\\'s seat. Since the only one riding in back is my son, it\\'s not a problem. Especially since he can sit behind my wife (5\\'3\") and have plenty of room. I am 6\\'0\" so I have the seat all the way back.  Not from what I understand. If the \"key\" does have a malfunction, the car can sense it, and flashes a warning on the trip computer. This allows you to still run the car with the fob in the slot to the left of the steering wheel. This is from what I understand from the owners manual. So you use the actual key to unlock the door. Slide the FOB into the slot near the steering wheel and the FOB will start the car even though the Intellikey craps out. Interesting, guess it\\'s time to crack open the owner\\'s manual. I hope I never have the opportunity to find out.  The Accord\\'s back seat is not the roomiest in this segment, that\\'s for sure.I don\\'t think it was optimized for people; it is fantastic for child restraints. Each position does an excellent job of holding a child/infant seat using the LATCH system. The bench is flat and does a great job of holding the infant seat in the correct position and it\\'s very easy to get the seat in there good and tight. I find the backseat of the Subaru more comfortable for people (2 medium sized adults is the limit, but my family runs small), but because of the seat belt arrangement it is difficult to use a rearward facing infant seat in the center position. Because of the door shape, it is more difficult to load the babyseat into the cradle with the Subie than the Accord.  Why are you comparing a hatchback with a sedan? Mostly because I have one, and that was the car type I was looking at on Mazda\\'s website before I began comparing the Accord to the 6. Doesn\\'t really matter anyway... the sedan and hatchback have similar dimensions except for the storage capacity.I\\'d avoid a hatchback because of the lessened structural rigidity (more rattles) since I will keep a car a long time.My Honda Accord hatchback held up pretty well as did my Legacy wagon, so I headed into the Mazda6 hatchback with a fair amount of confidence that they would be pretty solid. Having that much more useable space with these two body types in my previous cars made this a pretty important feature that I wanted to have. I just am annoyed that sedans don\\'t use their space as effectively as hatchbacks or wagons. And if you don\\'t want a car that has less structural rigidity, the mazda6 feels more solid than the accord even in hatchback form... although the accord has a very solid feel, the mazda felt like it handles the twisties with a bit more composure.  The back seat of the Accord is very comfortable for two people, but not three, unless they are small kids. I rode in back a few times, and the seat is nice. There is just not enough hip/shoulder room for three adults.  I\\'d avoid a hatchback because of the lessened structural rigidity (more rattles) since I will keep a car a long time. Given the last 2 Civics and the Accord in my life, if I was that afraid of rattles I would\\'ve avoided Honda altogether.I haven\\'t had an issue with rattles in the Subie wagon, or the Sienna. The new Accord is so softly sprung I don\\'t expect it to rattle ever (although we might have to do something about that spring rate  ).  The back seat of the Subaru Legacy is more comfortable for two adults than the Accord\\'s back seat? Not in my experience. I found plenty of leg room in the Accord. The Legacys I\\'ve sat in were more cramped than some compact cars in back. Although I like several things about the Legacy, including its AWD, I had to strike it off my list right there.  I\\'m wondering what\\'s wrong with your Accord; it is firmer than most of its competitors (except for Mazda 6 and Ford Fusion). In fact, my 06 Accord is firmer than my \\'96 or my grandmother\\'s \\'02.The only two Hondas we\\'ve ever had (out of the last 8 I remember) that rattled at all were my dad\\'s 2003 Accord and our 2000 Odyssey.My 1996 is still relatively tight and rattle free after 174,000 miles. My grandmother\\'s is as well, and she has 89,000 miles on her car.  The back seat of the Accord is very comfortable for two people, but not three, unless they are small kids. I rode in back a few times, and the seat is nice. There is just not enough hip/shoulder room for three adults.Size and comfort are kind of separate issues though. The size seems fine, the fact that is so flat makes it less comfortable for people but great for child seats.I can think of more comfortable cars, if not in the same class. I think the G35 sedan rear seats (and the FX35 seats) are the most comfortable ones my butt has has the privilege to grace.  After being in the back seat of test drives back to back, and being 6\\' 200lbs, I personally thought the Altima felt much better. I had my wife\\'s grandmother that we had to talk into even trying anything but an Accord (stubborn!) and she did (tried to get a door that was easie for her to open and not kick it). I can say she is now driving an 07 SL Altima and describes it as heavenly. This is after a 99 and 03 Accord. This weekend in the back of the Altima we had myself, my father in law 6\\'4 250 and in the middle a 4\\'11 160lb grandma. The roofline was a little short for my father in law though.

My grandmother\\'s is as well, and she has 89,000 miles on her car.The \\'93 & 95 Civics and the \\'93 Accord all are virtual symphonies on the highway, especially when the weather turns cool. The speedometers squeaked, the dash rattles, the back window creaks on the Civics, the front window squeaks on the Accord. Clunks don\\'t count, that just means something is broken, these are squeaks and rattles. Whats even weirder is that these cars spent most of their lives in CA, where the roads are relatively smooth, at least compared to MI.  The back seat of the Subaru Legacy is more comfortable for two adults than the Accord\\'s back seat? Not in my experience. I found plenty of leg room in the Accord. The Legacys I\\'ve sat in were more cramped than some compact cars in back. Although I like several things about the Legacy, including its AWD, I had to strike it off my list right there.I can\\'t think of the last time I had to transport someone over about 5\\'10\", and he had plenty of legroom, if not hip-room as compromised by the infant seat. I guess for our heights, I find the back seat very comfortable, although like I said, not as much as the G35.  I agree with you. My experience with Ford has been a lot better than my luck with Honda. I\\'ve had 4 Escorts, a German Fiesta, and 2 Jaguars. All have been very good. Regards:OldCEM  German FiestaOktoberfest meets Cinco de Mayo?   The Accord feels more \"airy\" and roomy to me, but its something intangible that I can\\'t really back up, so I won\\'t try to. Well, since EPA says Accord has 103 cubic feet of passenger volume vs. 96 for Mazda6, there must be a little extra space here and there in the accord. So what you say makes sense. I think the way some talk about the Mazda6 being \"cramped\" overstates the differences, however.  I\\'m not complaining about my luck with Honda either, they were inexpensive and reasonably durable. The Fords were also. Both where reasonably cheap to repair. The only huge POS we had was a Reliant and that was so long ago I can\\'t be mad about it, the whole company has changed hands 3x since then. That and they redeemed themselves with the Grand Voyager that ran great and lasted a long long time.Honestly, everyone is nit-picking details, its very hard to make a bad choice in this segment in aggregate, although some choices are better for some people than others.  There\\'s an old expression....perception is reality. That 7 cubic feet might make a difference to some, a non-issue for others.  So you use the actual key to unlock the door. Slide the FOB into the slot near the steering wheel and the FOB will start the car even though the Intellikey craps out.That\\'s how I understand it.I hope I never have the opportunity to find out.You and me both!   From my understanding, Its not the Ikey that starts the car, per se. the sensors in the car scan for it, or rather the signal it puts out. if the car can not pick up that signal, it won\\'t enable the starter. What the slot does, is puts the Ikey extremly close a sensor (not sure if its a different one) so its easier to detect the fob. Now I\\'m not a 100% sure of this next part, but i\\'ve read that the sensor behind the slot send out a signal that actually has a very, very, very small current to it that can power the Ikey just enough to send out its signal. I suppose you could test that by removing the battery from you Ikey, putting it the slot, then trying to start your car.  What about security with Nissan\\'s system, what do you do when some hacker invents a key that can detect your \"code signal\" 6 months from now rendering your keyless start useless or vulnerable to attack?  very doubtfull. The equipment to do so is proprietary to nissan. Even their technicians have trouble pulling that info. And in order to do so, they\\'d need the key. and if you have the key, why would you need to figure out the signal coming from the key. not that it would be impossible, but I doubt somebody with the technical prowless to do so would be targeting nissan altima\\'s.  If that were the case it seems like today\\'s key fobs would have been cracked years ago and people would be walking around mall parking lots stealing at will.  The same would be true of garage door openers/homelink systems too, and you don\\'t hear of that happening either.  The Accord used to be stolen more than most other cars. I wonder how many 7th gen Accords (with the immobilizer system) have been stolen? If any.  Last I heard, the Escalade is now at the top of the Most Stolen list.  It\\'s already been done. I heard on the news, your car could be gone in 60 seconds, by a thief with a laptop and radio receiver.  not that this is related to midsize cars really, but still an interesting article on how anti-theft systems in cars can be overcome... and how insurance companies sometimes won\\'t believe that these systems are defeatable and then won\\'t pay for your stolen car!!!link Pinch My Ride!  Don\\'t know about that. This thihg was one of my favorite cars of all time. I equipped it with a 4 tube header, Pacesetter low restriction exhaust, removed all the emission controlls, retuned the Weber duece, and fitted it with a high performace clutch. The little Ford 1.6 would scream. Regards:OldCEM   I agree with you - except for Chrysler. They seem to be trailing the pack on quality control again.Regards:OldCEM  Last I heard, the Escalade is now at the top of the Most Stolen list.Those lists can be misleading. Accords and Camrys are always near the top because there are so many of them out there.  This article tells us more about the system and what it is capable in the future. It expands on where it can and cannot compete with OnStar, navigation systems, and sattelite radio.  Mule pics of a new \\'09 grille and the hybrid mule. You might recall the renderings?Ford had them taken down where they could because they are, according to some Ford sources on other forums, \"spot on\" renderings of the \\'09 production model. Doesn\\'t confirm anything yet but very interesting to say the least.Note that the covered grille in the mule pics closely mirrors that of the rendering\\'s grille.  I bought the Mazda6 over the Fusion partly for it\\'s better (to me) looks. After seeing some supposed pictures the new Mazda6 recently and now this future Fusion, I think I\\'d be leaning toward the Fusion over the 6 in the future.  If these pics are correct, the Fusion is the best looking mid-size sedan this side of the Mondeo.  I think if those pics are correct then Ford has taken the 3 bar grill theme a little bit too far. The current Fusion\\'s 3 bar grill is perfect and best looking among all other Ford production. So the original is the best, what a surprise...  I think if those pics are correct then Ford has taken the 3 bar grill theme a little bit too far. The current Fusion\\'s 3 bar grill is perfect and best looking among all other Ford production. So the original is the best, what a surprise...Couldn\\'t agree more. Well said.  Well as an anti-chromite, I find the new grill less offensive. Maybe because it doesn\\'t have the extra 2 bars of chome lower down??? Or maybe I am overlooking the chrome because the headlights and tailights are less offensive (to me) in the rendering of the \\'09 vs. the current version.Also this may move the fusion ahead of the Mazda6 for me because, if the images of the mazda6 are accurate, it looks they are going to the (hated by me) chrome around the side windows, while ford just has the less offensive line of chrome at the base of the windows.Anyway, I\\'d prefer it with the optional \"black chrome\" grill that I assume will continue to be available on the next version...but I\\'d want them to make that version of the grill a stand alone option or let me buy it as a part and switch it.Glad I got my Mazda6 with chrome-free exterior (aside from the Mazda symbol) and woodless interior while that is still an option.

Couldn\\'t agree with you more. I almost didn\\'t buy my Hyundai because of the plood interior. But then I found they had another interior choice. While shopping, I saw an Acura TL (1999-2003 model). It too had plood trim. However, there were kits that you could buy to cover the plood with a brushed metal look or other looks. I think there were also kits that you could buy to add more plood to the interior. I guess there are still many who associate \"wood\" with quality.  Ok, I don\\'t get it. Makes no difference if it looks like wood, brushed metal, a piano, or whatever. IT\\'S STILL ALL PLASTIC! At least the wood look requires some pattern to the design. As long as it doesn\\'t peel off, it\\'s all a matter of taste, one style is not cheaper than the other. :confuse:  Unless you get an Audi, where they actually do use some real metal/aluminum interior trim pieces and parts.  My only complaint is that seems to take quite a while for a voice command to do its thing compared to just pushing a button. That will probably improve with upgrades eventually though. Love those gadgets!  True, but then you get to pay Audi prices.  I agree it is a matter of taste. For me it is the look, not the material. I don\\'t like wood (fake or real) interior bits in my car.

My only complaint is that seems to take quite a while for a voice command to do its thing compared to just pushing a button. That will probably improve with upgrades eventually though. Love those gadgets! The Sync site has a video demo and the system doesn\\'t seem slow to me. I\\'ve never used an in-car voice activated system so I have nothing to compare it to however.  All of you probably are sick of my raving about the hauling capacity of hatchbacks, but every time I\\'m able to get something into my Mazda6 hatchback that would not fit into a sedan I am that much happier that I made the choice I did.I\\'ve always been satisfied with my car, but more so when I overheard some people walking by my car saying some nice things about it as I was waiting for my queen sized bed frame with a high backrest to get pulled from their full service area. While I was waiting, I see many people in sedans trying to figure out how to get their purchases into their cars... several drove off with boxes precariously hanging out of their trunk since their packages would not fit through the cabin pass through. Others had to take their furniture out of the protective boxes to get them to fit in their cars. Finally after around 30 minutes of waiting, I saw my package # show up on the IKEA screen saying that my purchase was ready to pick up and be loaded. As has happened before, the person helping me load laughed as I pointed out my car and said, \"You\\'re going to put THIS in THAT?!\" When we were able to get it to fit without any problems, the guy said, \"Very cool! Nice car! What is it?\" Shopping there left me a couple hundred dollars poorer, but having a car that looks nice, that drives great and can hold things that other midsize sedans could never hold is priceless.   Not at all tired of hearing about your enthusiasm for a Mazda hatchback. I\\'ve owned two hatchbacks; it was wonderful how much stuff could be hauled in them. The only drawback I\\'ve noticed is that they lack some potential cross-bracing in the rear, giving up some body stiffness.  All of you probably are sick of my raving about the hauling capacity of hatchbacksNaw, what gave you that idea? Like to see you get a fridge, or sofa in there.  I have a truck for hauling things. Something like a lawnmower/generator, I don\\'t want inside the car with me.  Wonder if anyone has tried fitting a Miata in there. I miss my little toy some days, and may have to buy another one.The only two problems with hatchbacks are the safety and noise issues. Generally a bit more noise, and there is no way to really secure the loads, in most cases. In my PT, I did have a box with heavy rubber straps tied to those little metal rings, but really nothing which would hold up totally in a wreck. It is one of those 90% of the time, I would prefer a car with a trunk. I am back with a car with a trunk.For those wanting a hatchback, do we have a count on those going to test drive the Astra, once it hits our shores?Loren  Feel the same way about my Malibu Maxx. Sadly the Maxx and 6 station wagon will be no more leaving just the 6 hatch in the mid-sized field.  There is also still a Passat wagon.  Also the Elantra Touring hatch/wagon coming early next year. (The Elantra is a mid-sizer by interior volume.)  FoMoCo is eliminating its Focus hatchbacks and station wagons in the 2008 lineup. Hopefully, the hatchbacks will continue in the Mazda lineup.  Is the 2008 Focus getting up-sized to fit into the mid-sized sedan class?  hatchwagon gives an impression of being kind of tall. So there\\'s some nice hauling capability fitting things tall upright. The total length of the Elantra Touring from back entry to just behind the front seatbacks would be an interesting measurement length to have and compare with say, a Mazda6 hauling machine. zzzoom6, BTW, I don\\'t grow tired of your praising of your Mazda6. If you love it, you do, and that is true.Oh, pfflyer, someone re-introduce auto haiku again to Edmunds! Maybe I\\'ll suggest it.  The only drawback I\\'ve noticed is that they lack some potential cross-bracing in the rear, giving up some body stiffness.Which is why Mazda probably chose the sedan for its Mazdaspeed6. Strange thing is, Mazda chose the wagon for the Mazdaspeed3... And of course the hatchback weighs a bit more with all that glass in the back window (some have argued that this is a good thing in that the weight distributions is a bit more equal...I think that argument is a stretch though. this logic would suggest I should put a bunch of lead weights in the back). So perhaps it does not handle as well as the mazda6 sedan, but when I test drove the sedan I didn\\'t notice a huge difference. Both have a tremendous amount of grip when cornering and both still corner flatter than anything else in this class. Now that I\\'ve got this bed frame home, I\\'m now not so sure having the ability to haul these things home is such a good thing... my room is now in a shambles trying to make room to put together this thing! Sorry, no pics of my sanctuary, especially in it\\'s current condition! Alright, break is over... gotta get back to work.  Good point about the Elantra which is looking very promising, much better design imho than the sedan.  Which is why Mazda probably chose the sedan for its Mazdaspeed6.That is precicely why they chose the sedan. In fact, you can\\'t fold the rear seat backs down in the SPEED6 because of extra bracing that was added that would block the opening to the trunk and make that feature useless.  Backy, do you have any preliminary photos\\' or other information on this? Is it going to be, do you think, like the Kia Rondo or more like the late and sadly missed Elantra GT 5 dr.

I carried a sofa, and later a 18 cu. ft. fridge, in our old mid-80s Classic 900 SAAB 3-door hatch. Absolutely huge storage area - total with the rear seat folded flat was 57 cu. ft.  Actually more like the Kia Cee\\'d. Take a look here:aneesh, \"2009 Hyundai Elantra\" #1, 15 Aug 2007 6:23 pm  Actually, you can fold down the back seats on a Speed6, but the cross braces make it impossible to use the pass-through for large objects. It works fine for my snow skis, 8\\' 2x4s, or other long slender objects.  LOL... about a year or so ago, I drove a new Speed6 which was marked 23,995. Loved the way it drove, but one of the \"deal breakers\" was when the salesperson told me the seats didn\\'t fold at all. Why do I always get the salesperson who doesn\\'t know the product?To be fair, that wasn\\'t as bad as when we went looking at the then-just-introduced Camry 3.5 V6. The Toyota salesperson told me it had \"a thousand torque.\" I didn\\'t even try to correct him...  The Toyota salesperson told me it had \"a thousand torque.\" I think he was trying to say that it has a lot of torques.  Which year is yours? I\\'m almost positive I couldn\\'t fold the seat backs down on the \\'06 I played around with in the showroom.  I have an \\'06 Speed6. The seats fold down, but there is a panel in the trunk that must be removed (no big deal, just five plastic clips). The cross braces are a little sharp, but you can use some rubber trim or foam insulation to cover it up. This is not listed as a feature because the braces get in the way, but for skis or lumber, it works great. I still vote the Speed6 the deal of the decade for the under $24K many people paid for them. This is a great car. Power, handling, comfort, AWD, best brakes for under $50K, and good looks, too. There are still some \\'07s available. I wonder what they are going for?  The interior is very nice, but I just don\\'t get the exterior styling at all.  I have a 2006 EX Accord. Personally, I\\'d keep my own interior (it is less cluttered and from the looks of it has more storage space) but happily trade the exterior looks.To each his own I guess, eh kirb?  I like the looks of the interior a lot... reminds me of the Tribeca but maybe less futuristic. Anyways, I like it. But the button fetish that has shown up in the more recent Acuras is maybe a bit much. I suppose if the buyer goes without nav, maybe the 30+ buttons that are pictured will be shaved down to more manageable levels. But the flow is nice, and I really like how the inside of the doors look: nice accents, colors and textures. But the exterior of the sedan still hasn\\'t impressed me too much. It really reminds me of a saturn from several years ago. There seems to be no flow... like a bunch of elements designed to grab people\\'s attention (the crease on the side, the \"cyst-like\" bulge in the headlights, the alloy wheels) just slammed together and end up looking a bit forced. I know Honda has some great designers... the TSX, TL, and even the RL have great flow and balance that attracts interest whereas the Accord sedan tries to make a statement without actually pulling it off. Fortunately, the exterior of the coupe looks dynamic and sleek. And the blunt butt seems to match the rest of the design on the coupe whereas the same element looks out of place on the sedan. I especially like the rear side window and the lower crease on the lower 1/4 on the side of the car.Can\\'t wait to drive it... hope the clutch on the 6 speed manual isn\\'t as abrupt as the writer\\'s of the edmunds article say though. But the engine, as expected, sounds like a gem in both 4 and 6 cylinder forms. And the v-6 that drops to 3 or 4 cylinders depending on driving conditions sounds very interesting. Having a suspension that appears to be a bit more firm on the v-6 coupe is a move that I welcome and I can\\'t wait to try it. September looks to be a great month... the next generation Mazda6 at Frankfurt and test driving the new Accord coupe!   It looks like a winner. I wouldn\\'t hestitate to buy it in a heartbeat. Knowing Honda, they took a great vehicle and made it better, sight unseen.The Accord is the only car in the lineup I would and could purchase. Honda can keep the TL, RL and TSX, MDX, RDX, etc although I understand they have appeal, just not to me.  And the v-6 that drops to 3 or 4 cylinders depending on driving conditions sounds very interesting.And it looks like an EX, the trim I\\'d want, will start at $30k. That\\'s a bit steep for a family sedan. How many miles will it take to make up the price difference between an \\'08 Accord V6 at 29 mpg highway and an \\'08 Sonata V6 at what, like 25 or 26 mpg? Still seems like an unnecessary gimmick to me and one that could lead to problems down the road. How durable are the active engine mounts that keep the engine from vibrating when it\\'s only running on 3 or 4 cylinders for example?Aside from that, I think I like it. I\\'ll have to see it in person to be sure though. I do like the Tribeca-like interior though. Shave off some buttons thought. What is with Honda and all these buttons all of a sudden? And for the love of God, integrate the CD slot rather than having it look like some tacked on afterthought! It still looks as bad as the one in our \\'96 Civic did and gets blocked by the shifter in nearly the same way.  Still looks like a Saturn L-series to me (unoriginal, derivative, boring, etc.)2008 Honda AccordGee, Honda seems to be really excited about it\\'s \"large\" EPA classification for the sedan, while the coupe is still considered a compact? WRONG. Despite the fact it has two fewer doors, the \"empty nester\" the coupe is supposed to appeal to still needs space to carry themselves and their gear.The 4-cylinder is STILL sacked with a 5-speed manual? WRONG. A 6-speed manual is standard on the Altima 2.5S, why can\\'t Honda step up?Sorry Honda, there\\'s nothing new or ground-breaking here. The styling still screams \"L-series\" both front and rear, and the interior, with it\\'s 83 buttons, doesn\\'t look nearly as classy and elegant as the current-gen, and in general leaves a LOT to be desired.  The 4-cylinder is STILL sacked with a 5-speed manual? WRONG. A 6-speed manual is standard on the Altima 2.5S, why can\\'t Honda step up? The V6 still gets a 5-speed ATX too. Who on earth wrote that press release? :surprise: They sure do take a lot of subjective measurements and list them like they are facts. As I type this, I can hear the collective drool from the Honda crowd\\'s mouths hitting the floor while they read that tripe. :P That press release almost made me sick to my stomach while I read it. I know the mfr is supposed to put it\\'s newest baby on a pedestal but my God did Honda pour it on thick with that one!Styling embodies a bold, upscale, sophisticated and prestigious design direction.Prestigious? :surprise: Yeah, if you live in a white house, with white interior walls, a white picket fence, and think Maytag is \"The Bomb\". Premium features (navigation, interface dial, Bluetooth, information display) and overall refinement (solid driving feel) on par with vehicles one and even two classes above the Accord\\'s segment.So is that a hint that they are just going to kill off Acura since they obviously don\\'t need an upscale brand anymore now that the super best most greatest car ever has been announced? :P  No six speed automatic transmission? I thought all decent cars had to have that six-speed?  Funny thing is, the new Accord gets better mileage numbers than the Camry with it\\'s 5-AT vs. Camry\\'s 6-AT and comparable acceleration numbers.Guess that 6-AT may not be so important after all.  Guess that 6-AT may not be so important after all.Since the extra gear only helps fuel econ in 99% of its applications imagine what it could do for the Accord had Honda went in that direction. :P You\\'re also comparing an Accord with cylinder de-activation to a Camry without it which isn\\'t exactly apples to apples. Toyota still has their hybrid version and Honda dropped theirs in favor of the cylinder mgmt and a forthcoming diesel. We\\'d be wise to see how that all pans out before making such judgments IMO.Also, Edmunds says the V6 Accord sedan will be slower than the Altima by a couple of tenths. Isn\\'t the Camry V6, with the 6-speed ATX, faster than that?The 6-speed in the Fusion also does a lot for that smaller engine. It\\'s no barnstormer but it does put up respectable numbers that would be worse if not for the 6-speed ATX.I think Honda could have really pulled away if they used a 6-speed ATX. But they didn\\'t and I\\'m not seeing anything too terribly special about this new Accord. It is nice and surely improved, but it\\'s not leaps and bounds above the competition like some claimed it would be.  ...I\\'m not seeing anything too terribly special about this new Accord.

I think Honda could have really pulled away if they used a 6-speed ATXAgreed. I do think that the Accord should get recognition for increasing interior size and engine displacement, while making no changes to the transmission yet is still able to improve the mileage of the vehicle. The new Accord is certainly an iterative rather than revolutionary change, but Honda has always been that way. The new Accord is bigger, faster, arguably more refined inside (that is just a subjective area IMO) and certainly better looking than its predecessor.Don\\'t forget also that Honda will stage out further improvements. Look for the diesel (now that should be a HUGE step forward), look for a manual 6-speed in the v6 sedan.Take a look at this comparison also:link title  \"Since the extra gear only helps fuel econ in 99% of its applications imagine what it could do for the Accord had Honda went in that direction. :P \"I don\\'t think the sixth gear is that important in general on a family sedan.

Did you even need to look at the pictures/read about engines etc. to make any of your comments?  From the initial pictures, this seems to be a great effort from Honda. Looks are subjective; IMO the front and side look good, I feel the back could have been better. However, I will wait to check out the car in person for a final judgement.Similarly, the interior, expecially with the wood, looks great; I would expect to see the execution done well by Honda - still that is something one can only really see in a live car.Does anyone know when this car will arrive at dealers?  \"Still looks like a Saturn L-series to me (unoriginal, derivative, boring, etc.)\"Nah, to me, I don\\'t see any resemblance to the Saturn (seemed like it in the spy pics, esp in the back).

I merely pointed out that the Camry (which I did drive, and IMO ANYTHING is better than one) won it last year, and I\\'m sure that the Accord will take it this year, since there\\'s nothing else in the running (except maybe the G37 Coupe).Did you even need to look at the pictures/read about engines etc. to make any of your comments?I did, and based on what I read, it\\'s not exactly \"leaps and bounds\" above the competition that some people claim it to be. I\\'ll reserve final judgment until I drive one  The new 2008 Hondas may well be the best-ever Accords but the styling, interior and exterior, just don\\'t do much for me. I was expecting more changes, something more dramatic.As a personal preference, I like the 2007s better.  I think the interior (dash at least) is fine, if maybe a tad over-styled. The side view is also pretty good, if boring--reminds me of a 5 Series. But I really don\\'t know what Honda was thinking of when it penned the front; it doesn\\'t seem to match the rest of the car. And the rear really does look like a Saturn, as others have noted--or maybe a Sonata without the taillamp extensions on the trunk. So nothing special exterior-wise. The swoopy coupe is, as in past generations, far superior to the sedan in the looks department. I expect Honda aimed for \"inoffensive\" in styling the sedan vs. trying to break new ground and alienate a large portion of the buying public.  Actually you\\'re right about the design. I actually know a Honda employee and he said that the interior and exterior design of the Accord were based on the BMW.  Anybody read the MotorTrend comparo of the 2008 Accord v-6 to the Camry SE? Pretty interesting... they actually felt that the Camry was the better car in the twisties! I have heard that the SE was more responsive and had a sportier suspension, but still, I am very surprised by this. They do say that the Accord has much less body roll than before which I am very happy about. And they go on to confirm that the coupe is sportier than the sedan, saying \"The last time a Honda coupe offered these levels of style and performance it wore the Prelude nameplate.\" On the other hand the coupe, since cylinder deactivation will not be available on this body style, gas mileage is less than stellar with 17 mpg city, and 25 mpg hwy. Car and Driver also mention that they felt the sedan was pretty huge...almost the size of a 300 in length. I hope it doesn\\'t feel \"boatish\" because of this... but all the reviews don\\'t indicate this to be the case, but I\\'m sure it\\'s growth in size will be hard to miss. They write, \"Lots of car here, and a great deal of seriousness. No more frisky four-door provocateur of tire-squealing feats, although the 200-hp four shows that old Honda magic when you let it wail. But the car itself, even with the energetic V-6 up front, is good-citizen polite, a bit parental in its reserve. The average buyer age is now 50; these folks expect their four-doors to have expansive space. The floor is lower by 0.38 inch compared to previous Accords, for more leg- and kneeroom, and the rear seat was pushed back an inch. Factor in the extra inch and a half of cabin width, and, Accord, we hardly know ya.You&#146;re 32, going on 64.\"  I don\\'t think the sixth gear is that important in general on a family sedan. It is not one of the deal breakers for me.Totally agree with you. However, it could have been even more with the extra gear and really made the competition try to catch up in a hurry. As it stands it\\'s not really ahead of anyone aside from fuel econ. Even there it\\'s not the best because Toyota has the Camry hybrid, Nissan the Altima hybrid, and Ford will soon release the Fusion hybrid. None offer the performance of the Accord\\'s V6 but if fuel econ is your primary concern then you should not buy any V6. Is it a nice compromise? Yes, but there are better compromises (see above hybrids) that offer decent performance and outstanding fuel econ.Seems like with some of the other stuff they moved to the head of the pack again. Like what? To get the beter I4 you have to get the coupe which is moronic IMO. The interior is a cross between the current Mazda6 and the Subaru Tribeca. Nice, but not anything new. The new V6 has great fuel econ but is not the performance leader (as far as we know so far) so there are better choices if performance is your game or if fuel econ is your game. For example, if performance were my game (which is usually is FWIW) the Accord V6 wouldn\\'t be my first choice because I could be beaten by an Altima. Possibly the next Mazda6 too. If fuel econ were my game I\\'d be getting a hybrid or the I4 option. To me, nothing about this new Accord really stands out and separates it from the pack to the point that I\\'d have to say \"Wow!!! I need to get one of these!!!\". It\\'s nice, but not what I expected.  Funny thing is, the new Accord gets better mileage numbers than the Camry with it\\'s 5-AT vs. Camry\\'s 6-AT and comparable acceleration numbers.Guess that 6-AT may not be so important after all.accord sedan 19 city, 29 hwy. camry SE 19 city, 28 hwy. #\\'s f/ MT.Yeah, but the Accord sedan is using cylinder deactivation - CDA - (which is arguably more complicated and probably more expensive technology) to get this mileage. But if, as edmonds writers have said, the CDA system is transparent and does not draw attention to itself, I geuss it doesn\\'t really matter how the Accord gets its numbers just so long as it works reliably. It should be noted, though, the MotorTrend comparo gives the Camry the edge in which transmission it considered to be the most responsive.  I think the silver one in the picture akirby posted is without NAV. The seats in the picture are cloth, not leather which tells me it might be the base I4 (single pipe) EX (not EX-L) model. I don\\'t think a base I4 EX with NAV will be a popular combination so Honda wouldn\\'t use that for photo shoot. The screen in that picture doesn\\'t look like a color one used for NAV anyway.If my assumption is correct, that means both the NAV and non-NAV version will come with that screen (like the Avalon and G35/37) and the button numbers won\\'t reduce. With the way the dash is setup it is kind of hard to imagine what could Honda do without that little screen.  It\\'s nice, but not what I expected.Baggs, that pretty much sums up my reaction, especially after reading Motor Trend\\'s toe-to-toe match with the Camry.  You\\'re right. That picture was without NAV, though it doesn\\'t look to be the same screen. The NAV screen is taller and has a secondary screen below it above the vents, which the non-NAV doesn\\'t have.  Navigation is only available in the EX-L models, both I4 and V6.Non-Navi:Navi:  Is it me or does the non-navi stack have more buttons? :surprise: Good placement for the navi system though. Should be easy to view in that location.No sport mode on that ATX? I\\'m a little shocked at that omission too.  The buttons across the top of the non-nav stack are related to the direction of the fan and the AC, Defrost, etc. There are a ton of pictures here http://www.flickr.com/photos/[email\\xa0protected]/ that let you get a closer view if you choose to view them in a larger size.  I actually call this model the \"Lexord\" :confuse  \"The interior is a cross between the current Mazda6 and the Subaru Tribeca.\"The interior of the Accord is gorgeous; the Mazda 6 can\\'t even in its dreams have an interior like this (at least from pictures). AS for performance, we haven\\'t seen any Mazda 6 beat an Accords performance, and I don\\'t expect that to change.  \"or maybe a Sonata without the taillamp extensions on the trunk\"Which themselves were a copy of the 03 Accord\\'s.  Honda\\'s are usually conservative; same is continued with this iteration. The interior looks great; let\\'s see how well executed it is in real life  The non-navi does seem to have more buttons.The non-sport mode ATX was pretty much expected ever since the first spy shots started appearing  The interior of the Accord is gorgeous;That\\'s your opinion. I think it\\'s nice but still average. the Mazda 6 can\\'t even in its dreams have an interior like this (at least from pictures).I had an \\'04 Mazda6 and it had the same faux aluminum, silver plastic all around the center stack that this new Accord has. The part I was actually referring to is the use of the small display (navi), or larger display (non-navi) above the center stack that shows the HVAC and Entertainment info. Mazda has been using similar displays since 2003 when it first appeared in, you guessed it, the Mazda6. I like that they others are now using that type of display, but realize that some people won\\'t too.  The non-sport mode ATX was pretty much expected ever since the first spy shots started appearing Then why have the Accord faithful been leading us to belive that this new gen was going to be light years ahead of the competition? I\\'m still not seeing anything to get excited about.  FWIW . . . I\\'ve rented a 2007 Camry SE on two separate occasions and driven them over 1,500 miles on interstates each time with a consistent 34MPG. Interestingly, I just rented a new 2008 Ford Taurus (a.k.a. Five Hundred) with the new 3.5L V6 and 6-AT, and it delivered 28.8MPG (typical speed 75MPH) over a 1,350 mile trip, and it\\'s a pretty good sized car - considered a full-size, or large car, I believe.  \"That\\'s your opinion. I think it\\'s nice but still average.\"That\\'s correct; its my opinion, I never implied anything else. Just like it being average is your opinion, not fact. If you don\\'t put \\'IMO\\' in every sentence, why do you expect others to do teh same?\"I had an \\'04 Mazda6 and it had the same faux aluminum, silver plastic all around the center stack that this new Accord has\"Its the execution my friend; the Mazda 6 was all cheezy plastic; this one, IF it is uptp Honda\\'s usual standards, will be in another zip code  The non-sport mode ATX was pretty much expected ever since the first spy shots started appearing \"Then why have the Accord faithful been leading us to belive that this new gen was going to be light years ahead of the competition? I\\'m still not seeing anything to get excited about.\"Be frank, would a sport mode ATX make it light years ahead? No, and if it did have it, would you say it is light years ahead? No again.What excites me about this car is its gorgeous interior; clearly a step up on anything its competition offers (with the exception of the Passat). Again, its my opinion.  Is it me or does the non-navi stack have more buttons? Good placement for the navi system though. Should be easy to view in that location. No sport mode on that ATX? I\\'m a little shocked at that omission too. The NAVI will have many functions built into its screen/control knob, hence - less buttons.The screen up top debuted in the \\'05 Odyssey and looks great in both applications. Should be handy, I agree.As for the SportShift, I personally could care less as long as they offer me some options in my gear selector (D3, 2, 1). If it is just Drive and Low, I\\'ll be upset. If I wanted to shift, I\\'d get a manual, since SportShift feels nothing like a manual.As far as styling, its my turn to say a lil somthin I have a 2006 4-cyl EX Accord Sedan(LED taillight model). To me, the exterior of the new Accord is fantastic. The interior doesn\\'t impress me as much as I might have expected, although I think the gauge cluster looks wonderful. I read that at night, the climate controls light up aqua-green, while the stereo controls light up white, to help differentiate them easily (a simple way to clean things up, i think). Overall it is busier than my 06 is, although it doesn\\'t seem to integrate any extra functions into the interface.So, if we\\'re keeping a scorecard, mine would goExterior Styling - AInterior Styling - B+Interior Ergonomics - B-As with a lot of things, seeing the car in person could change my mind altogether in both respects (for the better or worse).   don\\'t think the sixth gear is that important in general on a family sedan. It is not one of the deal breakers for me. and it beginsI got to laugh at that one. Just like other discussions here, if it\\'s not on the accord, then it shouldn\\'t be on a car. everything that the accord has that other cars don\\'t makes it better, and what other cars have that the accord doesn\\'t is unnecessary, pointless, and just a gimmick.As for my opinions, the \\'08 is about what I expected. They\\'re still shooting for the 45+ midlevel management type and little old ladies. Bigger, and just about as conservative. But, I do like the engine choices they\\'re offering. a 200hp I4 seems very impressive to me. Even the 180hp version of the I4 will be the highest in the midsize category now.It will be real interesting to see the pricing on them.  As for my opinions, the \\'08 is about what I expected. They\\'re still shooting for the 45+ midlevel management type and little old ladies. Bigger, and just about as conservative.Hmmm, I guess I need a raise then. I\\'m 19, and love the look of the new Accord, more so than the exterior of my 2006.  Wrong, look at both cars, \\'03 Accord and \\'06 Sonata--lamps are much different in shape. The \\'08 Accord\\'s lamps now match the shape of those on the Sonata, with the sides canted back from top to bottom. But then, this is also much like the taillamps on several current Lexus models, so it\\'s hard to tell just who Honda was copying here.  There are exceptions of course, but the majority of people I see driving them are eitherA middle ageB FemaleC both.I don\\'t blame them though. Its the same strategy that put the camry at the top of the midsize car segment.  Uh...I think the 06\\' Sonata copied 98\\'-02\\' Honda Accord\\'s head lamp, NOT the current version\\'s.  But we were talking about TAIL lamps. :surprise: Hyundai\\'s engineers admitted they used the Audi A6 as a model for exterior styling. The headlamp shape is pretty nondescript and has been used by many, many other cars.  Okay, tail lamps. So you were saying...is similar toAre you kidding?  AS for performance, we haven\\'t seen any Mazda 6 beat an Accords performance, and I don\\'t expect that to change.This is the Honda-holic\\'s attitude in spades... whatever facts don\\'t fit with their view, they ignore. Ok, how about braking, where the Accord stops 10 feet longer according to the Edmunds midsize comparo - or were you thinking a bigger # is better? Or how about that the Accord tested in the same comparo to be able to do the slalom at 60 mph where the Mazda6 was able to do it at 65 mph. The Accord has many strengths, but to overstate and exaggerate how good it is does nothing but make me think you are a indeed a Honda-holic. Look, I hope the new Accord raises the bar... as a consumer, I always look forward to new models irregardless of whose name appears on the car; competition is a great thing and we are very lucky that this competition by all manufacturers in this segment results in better cars for all of us regardless of what brand we choose. As a long time Honda fan, I look forward to trying out the new Accord. So far, there are things that I\\'m excited about, but there are also areas where Honda could have done better. But the main thing for me is how it drives... for that I\\'ll have to wait a little longer.  No, I\\'m not. Look at the shape of the lamps on the rear quarter panels--they\\'re nearly exact copies except the Accord has more white plastic. And Honda didn\\'t put the extensions onto the trunk lid. They are saving that for the refresh in 2011 MY (don\\'t laugh, they\\'ve done exactly that before).  it does look similar. are you kidding? the shape of the tail light is almost identical if you don\\'t look at the part that is attached to trunk.  you beat me to it backy! anyway, this car is combinations of 4-5 cars. identity crisis anyone? i like this accord, but this really isn\\'t a design masterpiece. i don\\'t mind buying one because it\\'s roomy, saves gas, and reliable, but not for the looks. interior looks great except there are too many buttons for my taste(i like current versions simplicity), but shapes and materials looks very nice. oh by the way, tsx is the best accord ever.   Will there still be a hybrid Accord here or will there be a diesel? I heard the diesel is a 2.2 liter 140 hp I4 and gets 50 MPG. But I think they could make it more powerful.  Hybrid Accord is dead (, Jim). RIP.  I have to admit that I\\'m too much of a (I want power and I want gas mileage at the same time!) kind of a guy to have ever even test driven the Mazda 6. When you combine somewhat poor gas mileage with somewhat poor power at the same time, you won\\'t get on my \"gotta have it list.\" (Note: I know the Speed6 mostly solved the deficiencies and inefficiencies in the Mazda 6) That being said.... I do like a car that can handle well in the twisties, and the Honda\\'s have always been competent in this regard.  love mazda 6, but this accord kills mazda 6\\'s interior material. it\\'s too busy for my taste, but i can\\'t argue against the material.  Is it me or is it that Honda did away with cool electroluminiscent (optitron) gauges of the prev generation and replaced them with cheaper overstyled regular ones?  love mazda 6, but this accord kills mazda 6\\'s interior material. it\\'s too busy for my taste, but i can\\'t argue against the material. I\\'m not sure how you guys can say that? :confuse:  The silver plastic in those pictures looks exactly the same to me as what was in the 6 before they changed the center stack to all black. The entire dash and most of the doors of the 6 are covered in a soft material that has been compared to leather by MT or C&D. I can\\'t remember which one. Here, MT comments on the quality of the interior materials in the 6. The soft textures and surface coverings are unusually good and would be at home in any aspirational European sedan. Overall, the cabin of the Mazda 6s is highly functional, tasteful, and slightly more high-end than the other two in this test.The \"other two\" were the Altima and the Jetta. I don\\'t think anyone here will argue that VW makes some mighty fine interiors. Have you guys that keep dogging the interior of the 6 ever acutually sat in one and touched the materials or are you going by pictures?  Be frank, would a sport mode ATX make it light years ahead? No, and if it did have it, would you say it is light years ahead? No again. Honestly, no it wouldn\\'t. But I was expecting more. Maybe a DSG or something of the like. You Honda boys are quick to point out what other mfrs left out of their cars and are equally quick to defent Honda\\'s blatant omissions. How are we to call this new Accord class leading when it doesn\\'t match or better the competition in any way?  The \"other two\" were the Altima and the Jetta. I don\\'t think anyone here will argue that VW makes some mighty fine interiors. If they were talking about the current Altima (and not an 03 model), a Passat (not the Jetta), or an Accord interior, I would be impressed. But those two were pretty easy to beat, IMO.  It appears some folks have some serious mis-conceptions about the Mazda6 and what it is all about. I\\'m betting the next 6 will be a pretty serious sports sedan and keep all these other cars in it\\'s rear view mirror. I have no proof of that, and weight could prove me wrong, but I think Mazda will come through once more.  Please don\\'t generalize; if there are some people you have a drudge against, take that out to their posts; not mine. The Accord has always been a car that is good at most things it does, not always the best in any one category; this iteration seems to be following the same lines.  So you\\'re telling me that you think the Jetta\\'s interior is low rent then? That\\'s literally the first time I\\'ve ever heard someone speak negatively about a VW interior.  \"It appears some folks have some serious mis-conceptions about the Mazda6 and what it is all about.

I have no proof of that, and weight could prove me wrong, but I think Mazda will come through once more.\"Really, no one denies that hte Mazda6 handled better than the Accord; however, that was the end of its superiority over the Accord. Everything else, including engines, refinement power, fuel economy, interior fit and finish were always better than the 6 (IMO). I have no doubt that the new 6 will be a good car, expecially since mazda executives addmitted that the reason for the failure of the 6 in the US market was due to its slightly smaller size compared to its competitors. I am expecting a larger car this time around. Hopefully, they can keep the zoom-zoom DNA and extend it to superior engines as well.I will be in the market for a mid sizer in mid 2009 (when my current 330i lease runs out); be then both these cars will have been in the market for a year plus; things will be much clearer.  \"Have you guys that keep dogging the interior of the 6 ever acutually sat in one and touched the materials or are you going by pictures?\"I frequently rent Mazda6 cars; have always liked the way they drive. Interior fit and finish (to me) is not upto Accord standards, and the new Accord goes one up (I especially liked the pictures with the wood interior); having said that, the new 6 is due soon, so we can compare new to new.  Sorry, you are the one wrong here. When the Sonata came out, i had to do a double take to tell them apart (at least initially). If you read my posts from then, I always maintained that the Sonata\\'s tail lamps were a better form of the Accord\\'s; my views remain the same. Most of the automotive press out there (and this has been discussed to death) said as much; so I was not alone in this line of thought.  \":This is the Honda-holic\\'s attitude in spades... whatever facts don\\'t fit with their view, they ignore.

I have always maintained Handling wise the 6 is superior to the Accord - the slalom superiority would come in there, right? Or are your glasses too tinted to see praise from unexpected quarters? As for brakes, I changed to Potenza RE950s and the braking improved significantly. The brake feel of the Accord has always been superb.By the way, I don\\'t even drive an Accord now; have a sport pkg equipped 330i, so I do know a bit about handling/slalom/brakes.  The new Accord looks like a fine car, and I think it will at least retain it\\'s current status in this segment. It has a little more of everything compared to my 03 EX V6. If I was in need of a car right now, I would be looking at the equipment options and colors right now, and anticipating a test drive. I don\\'t see myself growing tired of my current car anytime soon though. The bar has been raised.  I can understand why some people (who do not have an eye for details) would think that the taillamps of the \\'03-05 Accord resemble those of the \\'06+ Sonata. They both have a horizontal orientation, wrap from the rear quarter panel into the trunk lid, and have red and white lenses. The resemblence stops there, however, and I can\\'t see any substantiation for your claim that the lamps on the Sonata are copies of those on the Accord. The shape is totally different. But Honda has fixed that for \\'08.But at the risk of boring everyone to death, maybe we should agree to disagree and move on.  \"it does look similar. are you kidding? the shape of the tail light is almost identical if you don\\'t look at the part that is attached to trunk\"Wow, you gius sure must be kidding. Half a tail lamp similarity. How about this; the Accord\\'s tail lamp mimics every cars out there with white reverse lights???? Maybe the car itself also mimics other cars, since it has 4 black tires?  \"I can understand why some people (who do not have an eye for details) would think that the taillamps of the \\'03-05 Accord resemble those of the \\'06+ Sonata.\"Please don\\'t imply \\'eye for detail superiority\\' and then ask to agree to disagree. You are not ready to agree that the 03 Accord\\'s and the Sonata\\'s tail lamps were similar, but want us to believe the 08 Accord\\'s tail lamps look like the Sonata\\'s, when there is no lamp on the trunk? Eye for detail or convenient memory?  http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FirstDrives/articleId=58887  Ah, now you get it! You\\'ve no doubt remembered all the people who said the Sonata stole the Accord\\'s rear end, when there was only a slight resemblence, yet now you don\\'t see those same people admitting the resemblence in the other direction. Because a Honda can\\'t look like a Hyundai (or a Kia, as in Optima), can it?   i loved the exterior, and loved the way it drove, but just couldn\\'t stand 6\\'s plastic. similar with sonata, but i prefer sonata\\'s interior(if it was all black like platinum edition) than mazda 6. anyway, the only thing i like(look wise) about this accord is the interior even though it seems too busy and less ergonomic. i\\'m pretty much sure that i would like the new mazda 6\\'s styling much better than the new accord because any mazda products are more sportier than honda. and i\\'m sporty kinda guy. i\\'m certain mazda will upgrade their interior material because both of their suv\\'s look great in and out.  \"Ah, now you get it!

Please go back to the time the Sonata was launched; you will see I was one of the first few who said the tail lamps resembled the Accord\\'s and I liked their design so much that even said that this should have been the design on the Accord.Af for your second point; I hate proving you wrong twice in a few minutes; please see my first few posts on the 08 Accord; I said that the headlamps of the Accord seem to resemble the Sonata\\'s. Wish you had read the posts before commenting blindly. That\\'s what happens when you generalize without support.  It looks exactly like a Porsche.....a 1954 Porsche-Allgaier P312 coffee tractor that is.I\\'m making a ridiculous statement as I\\'m weary of hearing \"it looks like xxxxx\" every time a new model of any vehicle is introduced.I like the new Accords styling on the outside, don\\'t like the inside. KISS!  Well the Accord is starting to look a bit blended, as most cars seem to be. People say the Aura was the fresh look or a Sonata is sort of like this or that, and well they all look like a blend of Euro knock-offs. I think the starting point was Passat for the Altima, which was pretty cool for the bucks, and the Camry has the bangle butt off the BMW3. Oh heck, what is the difference, since 1968 it has all been downhill. The Big 3 had the look back then. And in Euro cars, well I don\\'t know, they had great looking sports cars dating back to 1950\\'s. For the most part, the mid-sized and full sized cars are now all too tall doors, with some having the chop top look. Great, just great, like I want a modern day Merc chop top. Even sports cars have the too tall doors, and you now sit in a bathtub to drive. Very few graceful looking cars, and few with any wow factor at all. I wouldn\\'t mind some though, like an SLK. In a mid-sized sedan, my \\'07 Accord looks fine, nothing over the top and nothing to right home about, just modern and areo dynamic. Not quite a Jag for looks though  There is the new Malibu, which once again looks like another nicely blended car, as in all the rest. The new Bimmer 3 are looking pretty good. Altima I guess is the only less expensive car with some extra style.L   Because a Honda can\\'t look like a Hyundai (or a Kia, as in Optima), can it? Doesn\\'t seem like that would be a logical thing to do. If I am Honda, I am looking to emulate designs from higher end cars, or higher selling cars. Not cars that sell a fraction of what my car does.  No, they still appear to be electroluminiscent, much like the CR-V\\'s. They don\\'t show up really obviously in pictures, but they are.  AS for performance, we haven\\'t seen any Mazda 6 beat an Accords performance, and I don\\'t expect that to change. says 03accordmanThen I said: This is the Honda-holic\\'s attitude in spades... whatever facts don\\'t fit with their view, they ignore.

I\\'m more than happy to accept compliments from others, particularly from \"unexpected\" people. But look at your first statement...where was the praise exactly? Seems to me you were saying that the accord was, and will continue to be (even though you have yet to drive one and no review of the new accord has said that it is the handling leader in this class) superior in all aspects including performance. Did I paraphrase you incorrectly by being too literal in defining your own words?And as to my bias, everyone who has followed my posts will know that I like Honda and I like Accords. But for my wants and needs, the Mazda6 was the smarter choice, especially considering I was able to get it for 4K less than a comparable Accord. Believe me, I was surprised that the Mazda6 was my ultimate choice... it was barely on my radar when I first started looking with the Accord 6 speed and the Legacy GT far out in front. In the end, I\\'m glad I kept an open mind. But just because I now own one, does not make me dislike everything else... hardly, I have and continue to recommend other car manufacturers to friends and acquantances if their wants and needs seem to not fit Mazda. But I will not hesitate to correct people who try to misrepresent the Mazda6 with things that are untrue.Anyways, here\\'s some pics of my Mazda6 circa 2005 (the 06 and 07 have a black center stack). And the seat material is not the same as stock...after reading about a fraying issue on the older cloth seats, I got them changed before I had a problem.:  I have to admit that I\\'m too much of a (I want power and I want gas mileage at the same time!) kind of a guy to have ever even test driven the Mazda 6. When you combine somewhat poor gas mileage with somewhat poor power at the same time, you won\\'t get on my \"gotta have it list.\"Aren\\'t you the one with the Fusion? I haven\\'t heard you complain about the amount of power in your car even though you have power sapping awd and an automatic yet we share the same engine. And when a couple car magazines have tested the Mazda6 w/ mtx 0-60 times in the mid 6 seconds, I\\'m not too sure where you can reasonably say \"somewhat poor power\". Yeah, 215 hp vs 268 hp is a big difference, but it\\'s more what a car can do with the power that matters IMO. 0-60 times differ with the higher HP cars by about .5 of a second... not that big of a difference. And it\\'s not like I\\'m looking to beat every car at a stoplight off the line anyway. That\\'s why I prefer a car that handles well in turns and in braking rather than a car that drag races really well. As far as gas mileage goes, there was a couple weeks where I was doing all office work so I was only doing city driving with a few hills and tons of stop and go in traffic on the way home. I got 18 mpg in that all city driving. And on my longer business trips, I got 27 mpg plus while averaging 80 mph the majority of the way on a highway that had a fair amount of hills. This is better mpg than the new Accord coupe w/ v-6! And I am not gentle on the throttle either... while not rabidly tailgating and manically speeding, if the opportunity presents itself to pass someone or take a corner quicker than most, I will do so. And on the highway, the ratio of cars I pass vs being passed is around 10:1. Now I have no doubt if I were driving an Accord v-6 w/ a mtx, I\\'d probably get better mpg... but how much gas can I buy with the $4000 I saved when I got the Mazda6 vs the Accord? Probably a lot.  You sir raise the bar on Honda..itis (a disease where the affected person cannot see beyond a certain chrome \"H\" wherever it may be placed) Boy this IS funny.  We need to get away from characterizing each other and stick to the cars.  Interior fit and finish (to me) is not upto Accord standards, and the new Accord goes one up Unfortunately we weren\\'t talking about fit and finish but rather the actual quality of the interior materials. At least I wasn\\'t anyway. Look at the pics zzzoom posted of his 6\\'s interior and tell me how the shiny silver plastic in the new Accord is any different than what you see there. If what you\\'ve been renting are newer copies of the 6 then you are probably seeing the newer all black center stack which IMO is a step down from the original silver and the silver in the Accord and Camry. The entire dash and most of all the doors in the 6 are covered with a high quality, soft to the touch material that has a leather grain look to it.So you could be right about the fit and finish between the two but honestly, fit and finish are not on my radar anymore because I haven\\'t owned a car with rattles or squeaks inside since our \\'96 Civic. And even in that car the squeaks and rattles didn\\'t show up for 3 or 4 years. I\\'m not concerned with a few mm between panel pieces as long as they don\\'t make noise. I\\'m not actually concerned with the quality of the interior materials either and tend to focus on the driving experience when I\\'m shopping. Not everyone does that, hence our discussion of interiors.   Let me start by saying the new Accord looks alright but certainly reminded me of various others, Honda Ridgeline (grill), Hyundai Sonata (headlight), Passat, Saturn, Bimmer, etc...As for the Accord/Sonata revelation, it has been proven the Sonata did not copy Accord\\'s rear taillight, as the design froze long before the debut of the Accord in question. I believe backy mentioned it earlier, the Sonata\\'s inspiration came from an A6.  Did you realize I was not talking only about you and your opinions? I thought so, as you accused me of generalizing without support, but maybe not.The Sonata\\'s taillamps would have looked strange on the \\'03 Accord, IMO. The Sonata\\'s lamps fit its rear end perfectly--which is why Hyundai chose that design; not because it bore even a faint resemblance to the Accord\\'s lamps.Just as Honda had no intention of copying anyone (except its own TL, perhaps) with the \\'08 Accord design. But as I\\'ve said a few times before, there are only so many ways to bend sheet metal and make lamps that fit the car body while meeting regulations and being aesthetically pleasing.  Did you realize I was not talking only about you and your opinions? I thought so, as you accused me of generalizing without support, but maybe not.  I\\'ll go out on a limb and predict that the Accord will be a sales success and sell even more Accords in 2008 than 2007.The sniping will be irrelevant.  I\\'m going to have to agree with backy in post 4205. There are only so many ways to style a 5-passenger sedan, and they are bound to resemble yet another 5-passenger sedan.We\\'ve all been over this anyway; great style is in the eye of the beholder. Saying someone likes all things out of one particular brand just because of the brand name doesn\\'t progress the conversation, even if it may be true. But putting words in someone\\'s mouth won\\'t help things here.Let\\'s all take one of two things... a deep breath, or a Valium.   Yes, I think the Camry\\'s stay at the top of the car sales charts will be short-lived--assuming Honda can make enough Accords and isn\\'t too tight on pricing.  Did you see the road test from Edmunds.com, which I posted yesterday? Also they have a separate test of the coupe.I expect we\\'ll see reports in the auto mags like C/D and MT with their October issues (due out around Sep. 1).  I expect we\\'ll see reports in the auto mags like C/D and MT with their October issues (due out around Sep. 1).I won\\'t be surprised when Car & Driver and Motor Trend give the 2008 Accord rave reviews. That\\'s what they always do. The Accord and Camry are fine automobiles, to be sure, but I\\'m not so certain they actually deserve all of the accolades they receive.  First of all, I think you have me confused with another Andres, or Andre1969???I opted for the 2003 Accord LX V6 Coupe back in November of 2002, and kept it for 65,000 miles, 50 months, and sold it for 53% of the out the door 25K price I got it for (had 16\" polished aluminum alloy wheels thrown in to make it every bit as good as the EX V6 Coupe (except for no leather and no moonroof; things that I didn\\'t want anyway).I averaged 25-26 MPG in mixed driving with heavy San Diego traffic and I drive much like you do, if not slightly more aggressively (a lot as you described), with probalby a 15:1 ratio of passing people to being passed. On long trips, even driving through LA traffic (always a hiccup), I was able to average 30 MPG going 80-85 MPH whenever I could and traffic would allow. All this with just the 5 speed Auto.In regards to preferring a great handler and braker to a great drag racer, I say this: I want both! Why can\\'t you have the best of both? Or at least NEAR the best of both?  AS for performance, we haven\\'t seen any Mazda 6 beat an Accords performance, and I don\\'t expect that to change. says 03accordman \"Then I said: This is the Honda-holic\\'s attitude in spades... whatever facts don\\'t fit with their view, they ignore. Ok, how about braking, where the Accord stops 10 feet longer according to the Edmunds midsize comparo - or were you thinking a bigger # is better? Or how about that the Accord tested in the same comparo to be able to do the slalom at 60 mph where the Mazda6 was able to do it at 65 mph. The Accord has many strengths, but to overstate and exaggerate how good it is does nothing but make me think you are a indeed a Honda-holic. then 03accordman responded with: I have always maintained Handling wise the 6 is superior to the Accord - the slalom superiority would come in there, right? Or are your glasses too tinted to see praise from unexpected quarters? Ok, try to reconcile your two statements...they contradict each other a bit eh? I\\'m more than happy to accept compliments from others, particularly from \"unexpected\" people. But look at your first statement...where was the praise exactly? Seems to me you were saying that the accord was, and will continue to be (even though you have yet to drive one and no review of the new accord has said that it is the handling leader in this class) superior in all aspects including performance. Did I paraphrase you incorrectly by being too literal in defining your own words?\"When I said performance, I was referring to power/acceleration/fuel economy. Was not referring to handling, which I already agreed to be better on the 6. See any contraditcion there?  Baggs, the fit is responsible for rattles (or lack of), the finish is a different thing altogether. Finish is the actual finishing of the interior, which to me has been better on the Accord.  I understood you to mean performance NOT including handling. Though some might put handling INSIDE the word performance.Kind of like the way Bill Clinton defined \"sex\" or sexual relations. Simply a misunderstanding.   I won\\'t be surprised when Car & Driver and Motor Trend give the 2008 Accord rave reviews. That\\'s what they always do.Not exactly a rave review:C&D First Drive  \"Did you realize I was not talking only about you and your opinions? I thought so, as you accused me of generalizing without support, but maybe not.\"Now you are spinning it. You were referring to my particular post, not to anyone esle. You said I \\'remembered\\' that at the Sonata introduction some people said that it\\'s taillamps resembled the Accords, and then you added that \\'honda can\\'t copy Hyundai\\' or something to that effect. Sir, it was directed at my post, and when referred to my earlier post where I had said that I felt the headlamps looked like a Sonata\\'s, you conveniently backtracked and said you were replying to other posters as well. Not true. Anyway, I am not getting into a discussion of who copies who, neither was that my intent here.  Given that both the Accord and Camry have legendary reputations for reliability lasting decades and decades, I think no amount of accolades could be MORE than they deserve.  Plus, we\\'ve already seen several teaser shots of the new Mazda6. When will we have specs, photos and first impressions of that car?The 6 is scheduled to debut at Frankfurt early next month (press days are Sept. 11-12, open to public on Sept. 13-23). I\\'m sure the info and pics will be pouring in before the show is open to the public.  Baggs, the fit is responsible for rattles (or lack of), the finish is a different thing altogether. Finish is the actual finishing of the interior, which to me has been better on the Accord. I know. But again, we were talking about the quality of the materials. Not how they fit or how good they looked all grouped together in one big piece. The plastics and other materials in the 6 and the Accord are extremely similar. How they look all mashed together is where the difference lies and that varies from person to person. I think they both look just fine and certainly wouldn\\'t base my purchase one having a slightly tighter fit than the other.  If they were talking about the current Altima (and not an 03 model), a Passat (not the Jetta), or an Accord interior, I would be impressed. But those two were pretty easy to beat, IMO. I have some more for you in case you didn\\'t actually read the entire comparo I posted.From that same C&D comparison of the 6, Altima, and Jetta.The Jetta\\'s interior is clean, attractive, comfortable, and cool. Its solid, substantial feel is attributable to class-leading build-quality demonstrated by perfect paint, tight gaps, and nary a squeak or rattle. All the buttons, wheels, and knobs are damped and complement that oh-so-German black-rubber dash pad and the fold-flat ventilation outlets. Indigo-blue and red instrumentation, with logically located switchgear, is now a common VW trait, but it still looks as good as it works. The trunk is impeccably finished, with a full-size spare and brushed-stainless-steel gas strut to boot. There\\'s a reason VW/Audi are often benchmarked for interior design--they\\'re that good.You\\'ll find the same comments on pretty much any VW interior no matter where you look. Still think the 6 won that contest easily? :P   :shades:  Wow, although C&D is very reserved with its tone but anyone who can read through the line can see that they are not impressed at all with the 2008 Accord.Here are some quotes from C&D:You were just a cute little three-door when you were born. Now you&#146;re 32 and crowding the ends of the garage. Factor in the extra inch and a half of cabin width, and, Accord, we hardly know ya.You&#146;re 32, going on 64.I have to agree with C&D, this is no longer the Accord that I\\'ll eager want to step in and take it out for a spin. This has become an appliance, just like the Camry (5 inches longer than the Camry, are you kidding me Honda?). Man I missed the \\'94-\\'97 and \\'98-\\'02 Accords.  baggs32, the pictures you posted in #4222 are waaaay too wide for the page. I had to take the message down. Sorry.And in the process I managed to delete #4208 by benderofbows for no good reason. I can\\'t even get a copy of it. I\\'m very sorry.  :blush:  Not exactly a rave review:C&D First DriveThat review could have been (and probably was) written from a press release. All it says is that the Accord has grown in size, dimensions. Not much of a review at all. I\\'d wager a dollar to a doughnut that the rave reviews are already in the works.  When you think about it all automobiles are appliances made for passenger transport. There are some that transport in a more vigorous manner. Those have room for only two passengers..little to no luggage...and cost more than my last two or three years salaries. Then there are a few with 4 doors that transport 4 passengers with vigor..their luggage..and cost more than one years salary. Then there is the rest they transport me, my wife, an occasional passenger or two. It should get out its own way (0-60 mph in around 7 seconds or so) and gets out of that semi\\'s way at the end of the on-ramp. Gets 20 mpg around town and 28-30 mpg on the highway. Is fairly quiet and reasonably comfortable. It doesn\\'t roll over at the first curve in the road. Has a nice hot heater and cold A.C. Has to be fairly nice to look at for 5 years or however long it takes to pay it off. And ideally it isn\\'t in the shop for an undue amount of time. This pretty much sums up what most people are looking for so if that makes my choice an appliance so be it. Yeah, my choice of appliance may be different than anothers but in this category they are all people moving appliances.  Yeah, that\\'s the Saturn I thought the new Accord looks like! Thanks for looking it up and posting it. Despite the looks of the exterior, I am sure it will sell well. The accord, even without a redesign, is still a great car. With the noise cancellation technology and a step up in safety ratings (I\\'m assuming), I would think that this car will be considered an improvement by many.  Why me??? LOL  I\\'ll try linking to them later. Sorry about that! I have a 17\" widescreen laptop set to 1680x1050 so they looked fine to me. :blush:  I\\'ll go out on a limb and predict that the Accord will be a sales success and sell even more Accords in 2008 than 2007. I\\'m not so sure they will. not because of anything honda did in the redesign, but midsize car sales have been dropping for nearly a decade now. And now, more than ever, people want smaller, more fuel efficent cars, and or hybrids. For the last decade, the asian car companies have been doing alright by taking away from the domestics, but how much lower can they drive them?I think honda took a pretty big gamble with making it bigger, less fuel efficent. That seems to be contray to where the market is heading. It could pay off big if people (after a test drive) decide they want the bigger car. But it could also go the other way.  but in this category they are all people moving appliances.Truer words were never spoken. While all mid-size sedan owners would like to think that their transportation vehicles are \"sporty\" or \"luxurious,\" the truth is that they are \"moving appliances,\" not unlike a fine washing machine or nifty clothes dryer. Some are better than others at what they do, of course.  Unless you can read minds, you might not want to assume what other people are thinking when they are typing a post.Have a great day!  Yeah, I agree--C/D\\'s actual review and first comparo vs. other mid-sizers will put the Accord on top--again. By then they\\'ll get over the fact that the Accord is bigger than the previous generation. What a surprise--an Accord that is bigger than the last one! :surprise: Like that\\'s never happened before.Note their negative comments were really nits, e.g. picks on the dash styling and the fact that the car is bigger. And did I mention that they carped about the Accord being bigger?  It may not be less fuel efficient. My 2007 was EPA rated at 26/34, before the revised numbers. However, I\\'m seeing way over that, and I don\\'t drive slowly at all, plus I have a 5-mile commute and do mostly city driving. On most tanks I am seeing 28-31 MPG. Highway is 34-plus, even at 80 mph with the tach pegged at 3,000 and A/C on. I think the Accord will remain a good mix of performance, size, and fuel efficiency.  I think honda took a pretty big gamble with making it bigger, less fuel efficent.As others have posted, there really isn\\'t a drop in mileage with the revised EPA estimates. Bigger, more HP and about the same mileage. Not bad.  As others have posted, there really isn\\'t a drop in mileage with the revised EPA estimates. Bigger, more HP and about the same mileage. Not bad. feel free to correct me if I\\'m wrong, but the way I interpret most of what I\\'ve read is, the thing that keeps it\\'s fuel numbers the same is the cylinder deactivation. But, how many people will buy that option? and how many people do enough highway driving to take advantage of it?I still think its a gamble. most other car companies market their large cars separately, the maxima for nissan, taurus for ford, the impalla (which I think honda is targeting with the redesign)for GM, the avalon for toyota, the 300 for chrysler and so on. the only one of those cars that sell in signifacant numbers is the impala. and its sales numbers are still a good bit lower than the accord.  And in the process I managed to delete #4208 by benderofbows for no good reason. I can\\'t even get a copy of it. I\\'m very sorry. Getting a bit trigger happy over there?   Have you ever driven an Accord SEV6 or say the Aura XR? Bet they beat most all of the older sports cars for handling and acceleration and in a way are close to modern days sports cars. Yes, they are sporty. Why do you think Mustang had to up the HP on its V8 & V6? Look at the slalom test scores, 0-60 scores, lateral G testing and such, over the years then see how well the modern day sedan is -- just awesome. OK, it is not a Miata or a Porsche, but these cars are not old boats of days-gone-bye. Style wise, they look modern and sleek, with little to no wow factor. Yes, we need to get the wow back. GM, please bring the magic of \\'68 - \\'69 back! To me a true appliance car are those which are rental grade, such as the Taurus, Impala, Malibu, Fit, Aveo and the like. Those are bought for transportation, point A-B.Loren  But, how many people will buy that option? and how many people do enough highway driving to take advantage of it? That\\'s why Honda opted not to make it a \"dumb\" cylinder turn off system, but a \"smart\" one that can use not only half its cylinders or all, but also 2/3 of them as well; for low speed cruising, for high speed cruising, and for leaving Aura XR\\'s in the rear view mirror when the time comes.  the impalla (which I think honda is targeting with the redesign)I don\\'t see Honda targeting the Impala for anything. I think with the size Honda is making a play for those who are stepping out of SUVs but still want room.Also, we should keep in mind that the Accord barely makes it into \\'full-size\\' territory. If you buy it with a sunroof, it\\'s back into mid-size range (interior + trunk = >120 cu sq ft). On the mileage, all their engines are either more efficient than the previous generation or equally as efficient. Regardless of how they achieve that, that\\'s the situation.  I am old enough to recall the brand new idea from GM for the Cadillac. The 8-6-4 engine was going to be one of those great inventions. No thanks, I will do a wait and see, and may never jump into the 6-4-3 engine buy. I own the \\'07 V6 SE Accord and can get up to 29 MPG at good speed. At the 60 MPH speeds, who knows, maybe say 31 MPG or more???L  the majority of drivers now are locked into city traffic. I don\\'t see cylinder deactivation as being usefull to most drivers. a lot the same reason fewer and fewer stick shifts are being put into cars.  I don\\'t know any dishwasher, or clothes washer, or dryer, that would make it fun for me to use one. I do know some vehicles I could (and one I do) have fun in all the time.Fun is good for the soul!  The new EPA estimates will have many car buyers thinking the 08 models have terrible fuel economy, when they may actually get higher mileage than 07 models. Will this affect sales of all cars, or convince people to buy smaller cars? I think it will have some effect.  Well, sticks tend to get better mileage in the city vs. autos.......Also, if your only concern is being locked in city traffic then there is no reason to opt for the engine with cylinder deactivation in the first place!!!!  sticks do get better milage, but people tend to view driving them in traffic a pain in the [non-permissible content removed]. thats why thery\\'re dissapearing. more and more people are driving in traffic.Also, if your only concern is being locked in city traffic then there is no reason to opt for the engine with cylinder deactivation in the first place!!!! Thats my point. I don\\'t think many people will, and thus, the milage estimates will not bear out. As I said, I could be wrong, but from what I\\'ve read, the epa estimates are bassed on the V6 with the cylinder deactivation feature. I\\'m betting less than 15% of the accords will have it, and even less will bennifit from it.  Well, I live and work in and around a very high traffic city of San Diego, and I\\'ll tell you that the highway mileage still matters more to me than the city mileage, overall. Even then, since only the V6 has cylinder deactivation, most people will opt for the 4 banger, which gets better fuel economy than the V6, even w/o cylinder deactivation. SO EPA estimates for the 4 cylinder are great!  feel free to correct me if I\\'m wrong, but the way I interpret most of what I\\'ve read is, the thing that keeps it\\'s fuel numbers the same is the cylinder deactivation. That\\'s only in the V6. The I4 does not have VCM but the EPA estimates are about same as the 07 models.  A bit trigger happy? Heh, more like a bit addled!Um, ahem, no no, we had some, um, technical difficulties. That\\'s what happened! :blush:  I said, I could be wrong, but from what I\\'ve read, the epa estimates are bassed on the V6 with the cylinder deactivation feature. I\\'m betting less than 15% of the accords will have it, and even less will bennifit from it. Um, all V6 models of the sedan will have vcm STANDARD. You are talking about it like its optional, so just clarifying.  Again, the \\'08\\'s all have equal to or better than mileage than the previous generation. If you don\\'t want cylinder de-activation, then just get one without (I4). You are still getting mileage as good or better than previous.The I4\\'s are the majority of Accords sold so you are correct that most people will not get the VCM. Those who buy the V6 probably will.  Why isn\\'t the Mitsubishi Galant in the discussion? I mean you could get a 3.8L 258hp V6 which is more than some of the cars here. The Galant has many standard features as well. I can see this as a serious contender in the market.  Look at the Galant\\'s sales numbers. The reason you don\\'t see it discussed here more is because almost no one else sees it as a serious contender in the market.It\\'s not a bad car; it just doesn\\'t stand out. I think the interior is particularly cheap-looking and feeling--not even competitive with cars at the low end of the price scale such as Optima and Sonata.Bottom line is: what is the compelling reason to buy a Galant vs. one of the other cars in this class?  Loren - Although the Ford Taurus is perceived as the defacto rental car, you should drive the 2008 Taurus (aka Five Hundred) with the new 3.5L Four-Cam V6 and 6-speed AT. I just spent 5 days and 1,400 miles in one, and it\\'s pretty impressive. A substantial number of changes from the Five Hundred, and the new engine does wonders for acceleration and top end. Fuel economy isn\\'t too shabby either - 28.8 MPG overall average with speeds between 75 and 80 on the freeways - and, that MPG includes the driving in various cities while on the business trip. The new \"Taurus\" is a sleeper.  What about the VW Passat? It has good sales numbers, it meets or in many cases exceeds the competitors. Even in price by just a bit. But, it is even more technologically advanced than the others and offers all wheel drive like few of the others.  Reliability? Not sure the engines are new technology or not. Ask about how they are to be broken in. Also ask VW what they would consider excessive oil consumption for an engine. It is 8/10 Qt. per 1,000 miles. To me that is plain wrong. Now, what I do not know is if this is some standard reply in the industry. Personally I expect a Japan make to use no more than a quart every 5,000 to perhaps 7,500 miles. But eight tenths per thousand, I think not. How did the VWs do in the latest Consumer Reports magazine? Ever price the transmission repair on one? Yes, they look cool, and seem to have a nicely done interior. The German cars all seem to drive well too. If reliable, and cost is no object, it certainly is a cool midsized car. I liked the older Jetta for looks too.as always IMHO, your results may vary,Loren  No dealership in my area for 135 miles or more, and I live in California, which is Import car capital of USA. That pretty much sums it up. A look at resale value pretty much seals it as a no so good buying decision, IMHO. The goodness of product is a non-issue at this point. The car looks cool, with a unique look, but oh well, it is not only off my list, it is nowhere to be found.L  How did the VWs do in the latest Consumer Reports magazine?Very well. The Passat 2.0T is CR\\'s top-ranked 4-cylinder Family Sedan, by a nose over the Altima 2.5S. The Passat is tied with the Accord EX and Altima SE for top-ranked V6 Family Sedans. The Passat V6, which btw has the distinction of being the most expensive as-tested Family Sedan CR has tested, is Recommended by CR, and has above-average predicted reliability. The 2.0T has below-average reliability and thus is not recommended by CR. Also, the 2.0T is (as tested) about $5000 more than the 2nd-ranked Altima. Based on price, I\\'d say the Passat competes more with cars like the Avalon, Azera, Maxima, Taurus/Sable, LaCrosse, Lucerne, and 300 than cars like the Accord, Altima, Camry, Sonata etc.  The Taurus is a sleeper, or at least sleepy. Yes, for those wanting a Volvo safe car, with a pretty throne like driving position, at a Ford price, yeah, go for it. Not my cup o\\' tea though. I was referring to the real Taurus, and not the renamed FiveHundred. What a stupid move, IMHO, to give a new car the name of one which faded into rental car land. It is just all too sad. Take a pretty solid car, under power it when introduced, make it perhaps a bit too plain, though I wouldn\\'t say ugly, give her a name, then yank the name off in a year or two -- oh dear-dear. New engine, and some bling-bling chrome, with a bull name, will do the trick? Hey, I am not paid the big bucks, so perhaps the CEO is on to some very large plan here to save FiveHundred project. It would be sad to see it fail if it is a good car. I had a PT with the high seat position. Good around town, but nothing I liked for the open roads / country roads twisty driving. The car looks solid though and as a vacation transporter, it looks like it would be comfortable.I can see why some may like the car, and the value is there too!L  Well then the plan would be to get the V6 and keep a good warranty on hand, or around $5K come tranny replacement time. Good to know the V6 is reliable. That would be the one to shoot for. Avoid the i4 engines, I guess. How about the electrical? All the gremlins leave the car? If all is well with the V6 models, it could be a choice for a German FWD for less than Audi pricing. Is it better than an Altima, which I assume took on the looks from Passat as they look similar to me?L  Wouldn\\'t it be even more stupid for Ford to take a name with 80% recognition and millions of satisfied owners and stick it on a shelf while carrying on with a name that only has 30% recognition and a history of only average sales volume?Let\\'s revisit the sales numbers in a few months and see who\\'s right.  I guess we can\\'t talk about the 2008 Accord in this forum anymore since it\\'s no longer a midsize sedan. Oh darn...... :blush:  Actually, the host has already prevented it from being added to the Mainstream Large Sedans discussion.The Sonata is full size, but is competitive with midsizers, as is the Accord.  While all mid-size sedan owners would like to think that their transportation vehicles are \"sporty\" or \"luxurious,\" the truth is that they are \"moving appliances,\" not unlike a fine washing machine or nifty clothes dryer.Sorry, but I could not disagree more. I don\\'t have any particular affection for my drier, stove, or microwave. Yeah they keep me fed and leaving my clothes smelling like an Irish spring morning (whatever that is...), but if they were to get dirty, dented, or even if they would break, I don\\'t think I\\'d give a rip. But a car is so much more than these appliances... there is something visceral about how a car accelerates, corners and moves. For me, driving is almost therapy... it lets me forget about all the other things that may be happening and for that moment when I commit to taking that corner rated for 20 mph at 45 mph, there is faith, exhilaration, maybe even a little doubt, but my mind is focused on the car, on every little twitch, the tension of the steering wheel, remembering how much force my backside is being forced into the seat bolsters, and making sure that I know where the brake pedal is... just in case. Then I hit the apex, the tires are screeching, my heart is racing, but the car is still in my control... a small smile starts to appear on my face and all in the world is glorious! I take a deep breath and think, \"I love this car! I am soooo lucky to have made this choice!\" Never in a million years would I ever get the same emotions and level of satisfaction from a clothes washer. Yeah, it is still a way to get from point a to b, but if that\\'s all it was, I\\'d get a corolla. But cars mean more to me than that, especially when it comes down to MY car. It\\'s an expression, an amusement ride, my therapist, my tour guide, my hobby, my addiction, my means to an end... There\\'s a reason I, and dare I say \"we\", spend a good part of our day reading, writing, and even arguing about cars and not about refrigerators: we use appliances because we have to, and yes, in my current condition I have to drive my car, but I also do it because I like to.  And now the question becomes: What defines fun? In my opinion there is a fine line between having \"fun\" while driving and reckless driving. Are those who pass me on a curve in the mountains having fun? Do they do so because their car can corner better than mine at speed? Do those who blow by me at 100 mph on a curvy 2 lane do that while having fun (a Corvette did just that not too long ago)? I like my \"fun\" every now and then but like most people I just go back to using my \"appliance\" like it was intended to be used 99% of the time. Fun CAN be good for the soul...but hard on the wallet if you get caught!!  Actually, the host has already prevented it from being added to the Mainstream Large Sedans discussion. Main Entry: tongue-in-cheekFunction: adjective: characterized by insincerity, irony, or whimsical exaggeration  What defines fun? In my opinion there is a fine line between having \"fun\" while driving and reckless driving.Not if it\\'s done right. There are plenty of opportunities to have \"fun\" without even being close to breaking the law. It\\'s all in how you look at it.Zzzoom is right. All of us spend a fair amount of time reading, talking, and debating about cars, more than the average joe (and MUCH more than my wife!) That\\'s why we\\'re passionate about our cars, because they\\'re much more than just \"moving appliances\" to us. I\\'m proud of that, and you should be as well. If not, I don\\'t think this board is right for you.Just because the majority of us drives midsize sedans, doesn\\'t mean that we CAN\\'T enjoy what (and how) we drive. I\\'d LOVE to have a two-door, two-seat supercar, but it\\'s not practical for me and my life. Why can\\'t we have our cake and eat it too?  Also ask VW what they would consider excessive oil consumption for an engine. It is 8/10 Qt. per 1,000 miles. To me that is plain wrong. Now, what I do not know is if this is some standard reply in the industry.Yes, the typical industry standard is that up to 1 quart per 1000 miles is okay. So this is not a VW thing. Our VW has not used a detectible amount in 20,000+ miles.I think the actual reliability differences are a lot less than many think. When my wife bought the brand new model Jetta in 2005, a no deductible extended warranty to 7 years/100,000 miles was about $1500. For an Accord, the exact same warranty from the same source (our credit union) would have cost about $1000. VW\\'s are ususally highly rated by CR in terms of quality and drivability. They only complain about the reliability, based on data from their flawed survey.  VW\\'s are ususally highly rated by CR in terms of quality and drivability. They only complain about the reliability, based on data from their flawed survey.I\\'m no fan of CR by any means, but VW reliability (or lack of) goes beyond their surveys. Ask the dozen or so people I know that have owned a VW over the past decade, with their flawed electrical systems (constantly burning out bulbs, faulty door locks/alarm system, windshield wipers, dash gauges, etc.), transmissions (both manual and auto) failing after 25K-30K miles, faulty ECMs, faulty turbos on the TDIs, etc.Their lack of reliability is no isolated incident.  I haven\\'t driven one but from what I have read the new Taurus is a much better car than the Five Hunderd. With the new engine Ford fixed the major \"flaw\" in the Five Hundred. Since everyone knew that the engine in the Five Hundred was grossly inadequate from the onset, why did Ford even release the Five Hundred with that engine?  Yeah, smart guy, I picked up on that. :P I wrote what I did for the many people that may pop in to read, and then try to look for the Accord in the full-size room, since the host said we get a lot of reader traffic as opposed to a very small fraction of those readers that post (a lot of people may likely be first timers).  Fun CAN be good for the soul...but hard on the wallet if you get caught!!You don\\'t have to be reckless to have fun. I guess I\\'m lucky I\\'m not the drag racer type since that kind of driving is much more likely to result in tickets. And before I decide to take a corner at \"fun\" speeds, I always make sure I can see far enough ahead to make sure that there aren\\'t any surprises in front of me. If there are things in the way where it\\'s difficult to see, it\\'s not worth the risk.  From what I\\'ve heard, the 3.5L simply wasn\\'t ready. After having driven both, and lived with the 3.5L for the 1,400 mile trip, I can assure you the 3.5L has some serious \"grunt,\" and it\\'s quiet too, not thrashy. I drove about 15% in the city, and 85% on interstates, with a 28.8MPG average. And, in response to Loren\\'s post, on twisty two lane roads in Mississippi and Alabama, it wasn\\'t too bad either - no Accord mind you, but equal to or better than the Camry SE I last rented.Also, I prefer the upright seating position akin to a SAAB, Volvo, or many European cars, compared to the \"legs out\" position of other cars. After miles and miles of interstate driving, I\\'m still comfortable, unlike when I\\'m driving a car without that seating position. In some respects, the Five Hundred/New Taurus is a more affordable Volvo anyway, since it\\'s built on the Volvo S80 platform - not a bad thing.  I am old enough to have had some of the premier ( mostly MOPAR 383\\'s @ 440\\'s with one 340 thrown in and an occasional 390/406 Ford) muscle cars of the 60\\'s and early 70\\'s with my last being a 1970 Chevelle SS 396. Fun then was defined as street drag racing late at night. Well I guess that still goes on doesn\\'t it? As I said I too like my fun but now drive sedately most of the time as I would bet 99% of the owners of these (Camry..Accord...Sonata etc.) do. I was thinking a Z-06 Corvette would be nice though.  Actually, the new Taurus is built on the D3 platform which is a modified version of the previous gen S80 platform.And the 3.5L engine was at least 2 years later than anticipated so they would have had to postpone the Five Hundred, Freestyle and Montego for 2 years if they waited for the engine. The 3.0L was simply a stopgap measure. Same is true for the Zephyr - it was supposed to debut as the MKZ with the 3.5L but they needed something for Lincoln/Mercury dealers to sell last year after they killed the LS.  I\\'m no fan of CR by any means, but VW reliability (or lack of) goes beyond their surveys. Well, what I said was differences are less than many think and that CR only dislikes VWs based on reliability issues.If I happened to like the Passat best amongst the midsize cars, reliability fears would not keep me from buying. Most (but not all) cars these days are reliable enough that it is a non-issue for me.  EXCELLENT post! BRAVO! I feel the EXACT same way; and I couldn\\'t have said it better myself. Driving my car is TOTALLY a therapeutic and rewarding experience. There aren\\'t forums about refrigerator enthusiasts. But, car/driving enthusiasts? Too many to mention. It\\'s for a reason.  Yeah but even an enthusiast doesn\\'t drive in a what?...yeah, an enthusiastic manner 100% of the time. I absolutely love cars and everything about them and as I noted in my O.P. about what defines an appliance I do care that my car is reasonably quick, quiet, comfortable, fuel efficient, handles well etc. etc. but I believe most who insist a Mazda 6, for instance, is so \"head and shoulders\" above the rest in all performance categories that a part-time enthusiast couldn\\'t be happy without one are deluding themselves (well maybe deluding is too strong a word but for a lack of a better one for now I\\'ll let it stand). Most of us only drive at less than 50% of the capability of most modern cars in this class anyhow. A V-6 Sonata for instance is fast enough (as fast as or faster than 90% here) gets similar fuel economy, is as quiet as any here, and handles and stops as well also so it is the appliance of choice for thousands ($$$ for thousands LESS $$$). It becomes nit-picking trying to define what is an enthusiasts sedan. I can scare the hell out of myself in an Accord as easily as in a Camry..just before I drop back down into a sedate cruise for the remainder of my trip. Nah, those who say they drive in such a manner as to demand a more \"responsive\" car all the time are kidding themselves.  One of my all-time favorite things to do, ever, is to drag race a cop. I\\'m not kidding, it is hilarious. Almost every car being discussed here can really hand it to a Crown Vic off the line.I love it when one is next to me at a red light and after it turns green, I hear that Ford V8 start to rumble. I\\'ll scoot as fast as I possibly can up to the speed limit, wasting the cop car in the process, and then cruise along. Every single time I have tried this, without fail, the cop leaves it floored and absolutely blasts past me at 15-20 mph over the limit. If we get caught again at the next light, we just repeat. Every cop has repeated.Don\\'t peel tires, just floor it to the speed limit. Nothing illegal about that. And it is so much fun.  Well I have heard plenty of complaints about the i4 engines though and electrical problems. I remain cautious of the brand. The V6 seems better. The i5 engine is an old Audi, by any chance ???L  Well I have heard plenty of complaints about the i4 engines though and electrical problems.The i4 engines are great. Just add diesel fuel and change the timing belt at recommended interval and they go forever.  but I believe most who insist a Mazda 6, for instance, is so \"head and shoulders\" above the rest in all performance categories that a part-time enthusiast couldn\\'t be happy without one are deluding themselves I second that! None of these cars are considered appliances, by the people who drive them. And none of these cars are true sports cars either.  no I meant the i4 gas engines, with adding a quart of oil every 1,000 miles. I know they have an i5 now. Wonder about both of those two engines though for reliability. If, that is if they are reliable, the VW Rabbit, Jetta and the Bug may be a good by.L  The I5 is only in the Jetta, not in the midsize Passat. Passat base engine is and has been a turbo 4. We have had no problems with our I5, but at 21,000 miles or so that does not mean a whole lot...but it certainly is not burning oil.My kid, just this week, bought a \\'96 Jetta I4 with just about 100K mi. I guess we\\'ll be seeing if that one uses any oil...  ...I believe most who insist a Mazda 6, for instance, is so \"head and shoulders\" above the rest in all performance categories that a part-time enthusiast couldn\\'t be happy without one are deluding themselves...Nah, those who say they drive in such a manner as to demand a more \"responsive\" car all the time are kidding themselves.Speak for yourself.Yes, I don\\'t drive at full bore 100% of the time, nor do I participate in SCCA events, but I\\'ll buy a bicycle before settling for a softly-sprung land yacht because it \"supposedly\" suits the majority of my driving.And yes, there\\'s a LARGE difference between the way my 6 reacts when accelerating on a highway on-ramp (taut, composed) compared to a Camry and Accord (lots of body roll and lean). This, among lots of other day-to-day situations, make all the difference to me.   And none of these cars are true sports cars either. Owners of the SPEED6 or Legacy GT might want to argue with you about that. I know they aren\\'t in the list of cars compared here but their prices are right in line with the V6 models of the two best sellers here and will put everything else to shame any day of the week and still serve as fully competent daily drivers.  \"And yes, there\\'s a LARGE difference between the way my 6 reacts when accelerating on a highway on-ramp (taut, composed) compared to a Camry and Accord (lots of body roll and lean).

And that the Accord is a land yatch compared to a 6?  \"Owners of the SPEED6 or Legacy GT might want to argue with you about that.

One would tend to think they would have a niche market, but clearly that\\'s not happened. Also, these are not cheap cars, the reason one can buy them cheap is because the major discounts on them (which is a good thing for someone really wanting one of these). I am not saying that these are not good cars, but maybe drivers preffered (at least in case of the Speed6) the lighter V6 6, compared to the AWD Speed6? Never know how the market is going to react.  When I clearly stated \"I believe\" I WAS speaking for myself. Further I really don\\'t think any car in this class really qualifies as a \"land yacht\" and I have yet to be flung off the road by anything I have driven in this class. You are participating in the \"nit-picking\" contest I spoke of. OK if a Mazda 6 is the only thing that will satisfy your perhaps overinflated need for being \"one with the road\" then have at it but don\\'t presume to call everything else a \"land yacht\"..it isn\\'t the only thing that won\\'t fall on its side in a corner.  And yes, there\\'s a LARGE difference between the way my 6 reacts when accelerating on a highway on-ramp (taut, composed) compared to a Camry and Accord (lots of body roll and lean). LOL, yeah right...I have no argument about the 6 is the king of performance in the midsizer segment but it\\'s not like it is in another class all by itself. The difference between the 6 and Accord is small but noticeable when push hard. Camry SE can hold its own against any car in this class as well. Okay, so the regular Camry is a yacht but it\\'s mission is to satisfy a bigger crowd than the 6.Oh, by the way, one of the difference between the V6 Mazda6, Accord V6 and Camry V6 on a highway on-ramp is that the 6 is get outrun by the other 2. :P  Another big difference between the Mazda6, Accord, and Camry is that right now I (and anyone else) can walk into my local Mazda dealer and get a very well equipped 6 MT for a bit over $16k + T&L with no haggling. What kind of Accord or Camry would you get for that price? Would it have power seat, 17\" alloys, CD changer, ground effects, etc.? Plus the handling and great looks of a Mazda6?  The Mazda6 has been going at very low prices for a long time; and it is a tough value to beat (especially now with a new gen coming out). They never did sell well; so Mazda has had to dole out discounts by the dozen to get people to buy them, unlike the Mazda3. Maybe the next gen 6 will change this, since it is supposed to be a larger car to cater to American tastes.BTW, the year end clearance at Honda has been great as well; I have seen fairly low prices for the Accord as its ends it current cycle. However, these wouldn\\'t comapre with Mazda6 prices.  Also, these are not cheap cars, the reason one can buy them cheap is because the major discounts on them That\\'s right, and I pointed that out. They do sticker, well equipped, somewhere around $30k which is also roughly the starting price for the sportiest Camry and next Accord. I say that for the latter because all reviews of it so far say the EX V6 will start at $30k. If your intentions are sporting then you are much better off with a SPEED6 or Legacy GT IMO. Those two are true sports cars and fall in this class.  Oh, by the way, one of the difference between the V6 Mazda6, Accord V6 and Camry V6 on a highway on-ramp is that the 6 is get outrun by the other 2. If the 6 in question has an MTX then it will stay right with them particularly if the ramp has a curve in it which most do. At least around here anyway.  \"If the 6 in question has an MTX then it will stay right with them particularly if the ramp has a curve in it which most do. At least around here anyway. \"Not really, is the Accord has MT as well. Will still pull away.  Funny you should mention low prices on Accords. The Honda dealerships in my town seem to have an unwritten (since written would be against the law) agreement not to publish purchase prices, just lease prices. And the lease deal on the Accord LX right now is worse than it was earlier in the year: still $199/month but nearly $3000 up front. The up-front money is much higher than it was earlier this year. In fact, earlier in the year the deal was $199/mo. for a V6! That seems odd to be given Honda must be trying to close out the Accords before the new models roll in.Personally I like the size of the current Mazda6 and don\\'t like the trend of making mid-sized cars larger (on the outside). The new Accord is 194\" for gosh sakes! That\\'s about 6\" less than the huge Grand Caravan I had. And it was a cumbersome beast to park. Other automakers seem to be able to fit mid-sized space (even large-car space) into a smaller package. Maybe Honda should add a large sedan ala Avalon to its lineup so it can let the Accord play the role of mid-sized family sedan and keep it a decent size.  The Azera is 192.7, Avalon 197.2, and Amanti 196.9 inches long. If this keeps up, the Accord will be clearly in the next size up. Not good for those that like mid-sized cars.  But good for those who are looking for a bigger Honda sedan.  Length of a car does not exactly measure usable space - interior volume, trunk space. The perfect example is, despite the Azera being shorter than the Avalon, the interior volume and trunk space is the same between the two. On by the way, the Accord (w/o sunroof only per louiswei) is a large car per EPA. It\\'s the second car to the Sonata (w/ or w/o sunroof) classified as a large car by EPA, two and half years later. Which car will be next? Probably not the Mazda6.  You\\'d think they\\'d just make a larger car under a different name. Everybody else does.  The 3 series is a perfect example of a car that has grown in length and girth over the years. Now BMW is introducing the 1 series, which probably is as small as the original 2002.  Again, not if there\\'s a curve involved. Once they get out on the highway it\\'s anyone\\'s game because the published numbers usually don\\'t tell us gearing. Full throttle on a straight away, yes the Accord will most likely pull away but onramps aren\\'t all like that now are they?Either way I\\'m beating both of them by A LOT even with my wife and two kids in the cabin. Curves, no curves, whatever.   Something like McDonald\\'s does with super sizing that meal. Call the new larger Accord the Accord SS or Super Sized.  We fit larger beltlines! I got the \\'07, and I am thinking it to be fairly large as is. Oh well, make no difference to me.L  Honda already brought the Fit over here because the Civic is now the size of the original Accord (or bigger?). So the next logical step is to introduce a new mid-sized car for 2013, slotted between the Civic and Accord, at which time the Accord will be about the size of the Crown Vic.  Or maybe by then the Civic will be big enough to take over as Honda\\'s mid-sized car.  \"According\" to a USA Today story, only the LX trim (without sunroof) has enough interior volume to qualify as a large car per EPA measurements, just making it with no room to spare. I don\\'t know why the others wouldn\\'t, but that\\'s what the story said.  The sunroof reduces headroom; less headroom = less cubic feet.  Grad: I was referring to the part that said only the LX trim qualilfies as \"large\".  but the difference is, there is demand for it. as us americans get fatter, we wan\\'t more food. but with cars, the trend is different. less people getting married, waiting longer (if ever) to have kids, and having less of them. more and more people are buying smaller cars, not bigger.I\\'m not saying honda can\\'t pull it off, if anybody can it\\'s probably them. But seems like a gutsy thing to do with their #1 vehicle  Length of a car does not exactly measure usable space - interior volume, trunk space.Interior volume is not always the best measure either. Somewhat lower roofline reduces interior volume, but does not change a mid-size to a compact no matter what EPA thinks. (Malibu is a mid-size and G6 is a compact per EPA.)Adding a sunroof also does not convert a large car to a midsize. While interior space is important, exterior dimensions, wheelbase. and weight are also important factors in classifying cars as these affect how it drives. EPA may think the Sonata and the Crown Vic are in the same size class, personally I think the 2 foot difference in length puts them in different classes. Of course, actually EPA also recognizes this which is why they have market class which \"groups together cars that are similar from the car buyer\\'s perspective\", in addition to the official EPA size classification based on interior volume. The \"market class\" sensibly puts the Sonata in the \"family sedan\" category and the Crown Vic in the \"large sedan\" category.http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass.htm  Doesn\\'t seem like growing larger has hurt Camry sales any (07vs06), so why would it hurt Accord sales?  cause the camry hasn\\'t grown that large, they still keep the avalon bigger to fill that spot. I\\'m not saying it won\\'t work, just seems to be moving in the opposite direction of where the market is going. Mid size sales have been dropping for a long time now. I seem to remember reading somewhere that over the last 10 years or so, they\\'re down about a million units. just look at the trend. the accord sales peaked in 2001-2002. the civic, versa, and crv (i know its a suv/cuv, but it is the small version) are way up. same way with toyota. their fastest growing cars are the matrix, yarris, carolla. nissan and Gm are an exception, but the versa is selling as fast as they can make them, and the altima was made smaller this time arround. and if the sentra were a better car, it might be cutting into altima sales. same with gm. I think they only reason the impala does as well as it does is because the malibu and cobalt are such poor choices.As said before, It may work. Honda is usually very good at guessing the market. Just seems like a big risk to take with the #2 selling car in the country.  And only the LX and LX-P models are full size, the EX is still a midsize because of a lack of Sunroofs.I also read that EX models (EX-L, EXV6 and EXLV6 models) will make up over 50 percent of sales this time.  Grad: I was referring to the part that said only the LX trim qualilfies as \"large\".That\\'s what he was trying to say. The LX does not have a sunroof but the EX does. The sunroof takes away cubic inches from the interior because the height of the car stays the same but the inside of the ceiling is lower to allow for the sliding mechanism.That reduction in cubic inches is enough to reduce the overall volume back to midsize in the EX.  Tallman beat me to it. Post 4316 is exactly what I was talking about.  some graphics from Temple of VTEC:Headroom of 2007 (front/rear): 40.4 / 38.5Legroom of 2007 (f/r): 42.6 / 36.8Looks like the only real gain in the 2008 in interior dimensions is driver\\'s headroom which gains an inch. Legroom actually decreases in the back...  Maybe the reason growing in size didn\\'t hurt the 2007 Camry is because it\\'s the same length as the previous generation, yet with more interior room--a very intelligent use of space. Whereas the Accord grew nearly 6-1/2\" in length from 2007 to 2008 and is now five inches longer than the Camry (and also the Sonata, although the Sonata actually has more interior room than the Accord).  Thanks.I didn\\'t know the Honda does not offer a sunroof across the board in the Accord. So, it still seems like the Accord shouldn\\'t be considered \"large\" by Edmunds if so many Accord sales are for trims above LX.  Look back on the previous page of this thread, if you would, and tell me you see 6-1/2\". I see 3\" longer and 1\" wider, and 1\" taller. Not a huge difference, IMO. It seems bigger is better (to you) when it\\'s the Sonata, but no so for the Accord. What\\'s up with that?  Sonata: 188.9Camry: 189.2Accord: 194.1I should have used a calculator the first time--it\\'s actually almost 5-1/2\", not 6-1/2\". But if you see only 3\", I guess you need glasses? Bigger is better when it doesn\\'t make the car a cumbersome size. The Camry and Sonata manage to house roomy interiors with less length. Actually, the Camry and Sonata are longer than I like/need. I prefer cars like the Elantra and Versa that are roomy inside (mid-sized car volume) but compact outside--in this case nearly a foot and a half shorter than the Accord. The Elantra puts more interior volume than the \\'07 Accord EX into 177 inches. I suppose some folks like big (long) cars, but I don\\'t see the benefit unless it translates into more useable room. Parking spaces seem to be getting smaller, and I\\'m not accumulating less stuff in my garage every year.   Whereas the Accord grew nearly 6-1/2\" in length from 2007 to 2008I\\'m not going crazy, you did say the 08 Accord was 6-1/2\" larger than the 07 Accord was (not the Camry and Sonata) :P . When it has grown only 3\". These are your own words. And even though the 08 Accord is 5-1/2\" longer than the Sonata or Camry, I don\\'t see that making a big difference.  Yes, I looked up the number for the 2007 Accord but didn\\'t notice it was for the coupe. Thanks for the correction.If 5-1/2\" is not a big difference for you, that\\'s great. I know that parking my 200\" long van in my garage was a real squeeze sometimes. The Accord is 6\" shorter, but I have more stuff in my garage now than I did when I owned the van. If I have choice between a \"mid-sized sedan\" that\\'s 194\" or one that\\'s 177\", I prefer the shorter, easier to park car. Or if I have a choice between two sedans that have about the same interior space, I prefer the one that\\'s almost half a foot shorter.I can\\'t wait for the Gen 9 Accord--will probably give my old Grand Caravan a run for its money in length. :sick: Maybe it will have footrests in back though.   I think your have to sit in the car to evaluate the interior roominess. Roominess is function of interior ergonomics not of cubic feet. Knowing Honda they probably made very good use of interior layout without compromising the other fine qualities of the car.Of course, what not \"compromising is\", will be subject to interpertation.  I agree, it\\'s not just cubic feet for interior room. But length is length--no need to try a \"garage door test\" to evaluate that.   True, but to me the length is inconsequential, unless I was talking about a Mini Cooper. In a so called mid-sized family sedan I want roominess without being barge-like.  This review was generally positive, but did mention that the base model\\'s interior materials seemed inferior.An interesting fact pointed out in their review is that the first generation Accord had a 93 inch wheel base, which is shorter than the current Honda Fit.  Did anyone read this? This review wasn\\'t generally positive, it was all positive.http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FirstDrives/articleId=58887  Did anyone read this? This review wasn\\'t generally positive, it was all positive.http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FirstDrives/articleId=58887It could easily be titled, \"Accord strikes a chord.\" Still haven\\'t figured out why Honda enlarged the dimensions to the point where it\\'s no longer a mid-size sedan.  Yes, I read it--and posted it here--five days ago.backy, \"Midsize Sedans 2.0\" #4191, 21 Aug 2007 7:23 pm!keywords=allin%3Amsgtext%20limit%3A.f12d514%20FirstDrivesMaybe more people will read it now that you\\'ve posted it.So far the only negatives I\\'ve seen mentioned in reviews are lower quality interior materials on the \"base\" model (whatever that is--LX?) and some carping on size. Looks like another winner for Honda. It will be interesting to see how sales do at first with no incentives--that will make the \\'08 Accords much more OTD than the \\'07s and $5000+ more than some competitors. But there\\'s probably a lot of Honda fans who\\'ve been waiting to grab a next-gen Accord.  Further I really don\\'t think any car in this class really qualifies as a \"land yacht\" and I have yet to be flung off the road by anything I have driven in this class. You are participating in the \"nit-picking\" contest I spoke of.It may be \"nit-picking\" to you, but when it involves over $20K of MY hard-earned cash to purchase a vehicle, it\\'s not \"nit-picking\" to me, or anyone else that values handling.OK if a Mazda 6 is the only thing that will satisfy your perhaps overinflated need for being \"one with the road\" then have at it but don\\'t presume to call everything else a \"land yacht\"..it isn\\'t the only thing that won\\'t fall on its side in a corner. If you think that my needs are \"overinflated\" (which is obviously YOUR opinion), then why can\\'t I call the others in this class \"land yachts\", which is clearly MY opinion?  What kind of Accord or Camry would you get for that price?With a V6? Used.  I looked back in previous posts and didn\\'t see it, else I wouldn\\'t have reposted it. Once the sedan is readily available the \"real truth\" will come out.  So the Accord grew 3\" longer and 1\" wider, and that makes it a land yacht? So if the interior volume moves a fraction of an inch above Midsize, all of a sudden it\\'s huge. :confuse: Honda has simply built the car they think Americans want. Are they right, or wrong? The sales numbers will tell the tale. I think it will do at least as well as the 7th gen did.  Honda is probably spot-on as far as what most Americans want, i.e., bigger is better (see: Suburban). There\\'s just some of us who don\\'t equate sheer size with goodness, unless there\\'s a benefit to the size other than helping the steel companies sell more of it. Honda did add more interior volume for 2008, but that doesn\\'t impress me given some of their competitors have already done that, but with more efficient packaging.But Honda is smart, and it\\'s all probably part of their plan to make the next Fit compact-class, and the next Civic mid-sized class. Then they can introduce a car under the Fit.  Actually, people have been talking about that and the coupe article here: Article Comments - 2008 Honda Accord Coupe and Sedan First Drive. Everyone is welcome to drop by!   But Honda is smart,No doubt about it.  Honda is probably spot-on as far as what most Americans want, i.e., bigger is better (see: Suburban). There\\'s just some of us who don\\'t equate sheer size with goodnessTruth be told, I\\'m one of those who wants all the size I can afford (how American of me, right?) I\\'m 6\\'4\" and have never found a car other than a TRUCK that had enough legroom for me (I have LONG legs and short torso). My Accord is a 2006, and my knees are never able to straighten out as much as I\\'d physically want, but that was true for any car, not just Accord. I couldn\\'t afford 15 MPG of a pickup or large SUV, so the midsize MPG was the best compromise I could find. Since the Accord has added power, has same/better MPG, and larger interior/exterior, I wouldn\\'t have a problem swapping mine for a new one. I think my Accord\\'s interior is classier looking though.  When the 2003 Accord first came out, I thought the car looked ugly, but the look slowly growed on me and I think the 03-07 Accord looks just fine. Hell, I thought my wife was ugly when I married her but she is looking better everyday. Same analogy can be applied to the 08 Accord. For those of you who don\\'t like the look, look at it upfront instead of the pics and you might actually like it. (Thank god my wife doesn\\'t visit Edmund\\'s forum, otherwise I would be sleeping in the doghouse tonight)  Did you try the Elantra at the time you got your Accord? More front leg room than the 2006 Accord (43.2 vs. 42.6 inches, although the new-for-2007 Elantra has 43.5\"). Since the old Accord fits you, the Elantra might also.So, leg room isn\\'t necessarily a function of vehicle size. Another example is the Versa. The 5-door is only 169\" long, or over two feet shorter than the 2008 Accord. But I found it has more stretch-out rear leg room (including lots of toe space) than the two-classes-bigger Altima, when I had the driver\\'s seats adjusted for comfort. It felt like a limosine in back! Definitely one of those \"try before you buy\" things.  You can find a lot of leg room in some pretty small cars. My 92 Nissan Sentra had gobs of legroom.  There were other factors that caused me to want a car the Accord\\'s size; including a pretty amazing power-to-economy ratio, plenty of room all-around, and a bit of a heavier car made the parents happy. I was coming from a 1996 Accord (which I still drive some), so stepping into an Elantra would probably feel like I was going backwards (not a 07 of course, but the 2001-2006 model). Honestly, I never set foot in an Elantra because the dated looks turned me off. Lots of car for the money, but if it is a car you don\\'t want, you\\'ve wasted your money good deal or not, right?My whole point was to say that not everyone feels that more room is bad, just like not everyone feels like a bigger car is good. To each their own. In my case, more room = better.  I agree 100% that more room is better. What I don\\'t agree with is more length is better.  I\\'d be willing to add 3 inches length to my 2006 if I could get two extra inches of legroom.  Round\\'n round it goes. OK you love your \"6\" good for you. I don\\'t dislike them particularly or like them either. I am neutral but probably wouldn\\'t consider one when buying my next new sedan. So, in the end you are correct of course..your money...your priorities...your decision. Enjoy!!!!  I would not have bought a car that had inadequate legroom, in the first place. Being comfortable sitting in the car is mandatory for me to consider buying. However, I understand that you have extreme leg room needs...Does the 2008 Accord add 2 inches of leg room?  Grad,Have you tried the \\'07 Altima? I\\'m 6\\'-3\", and I can\\'t put the seat all the way back in my wifes Altima. I can tip-toe the pedals, but thats it.  It\\'s weird, but in all the press for the 2008 Accord, all I see is mention of the extra 0.4\" legroom in the back compared to 2007, and the extra width up front (and back). No mention of more legroom in front. I\\'d think if there were improvements there, it would be mentioned prominently, just like they did for the rear legroom increase (a whole 4/10 of an inch there!). So maybe you don\\'t get at least 2\" more legroom overall from the 3\" extra length?  and in order to get the extra leg room, they had to reduce the trunk space, If I read that right.  No mention of more legroom in front.According to the Spec sheets for each, front leg room for the 07 and the 08 Accord are:07: 42.608: 42.5  I guess I should have stated it more clearly.I am not uncomfortable in my current vehicles, a 1996 Accord (compact) and a 2006 Accord (midsize). Would I welcome more legroom? Whole heartedly. Am I cramped or uncomfortable though? Nah. I like the idea of having stretch out space, but I have never had a problem traveling in my Accord, driving for long periods of time (10 hours at a time, only stopping for lunch/gas/pee breaks). Second of all, I would welcome larger exterior size if it bought me more legroom (I don\\'t have a need for a wider or taller car, as I have plenty of hip, head, and shoulder room in my sunroof-equipped Accord as it is. The only thing that would make a good thing better in my case is legroom (I have enough to be comfortable, but more spread-out/stretch-out room never hurts at 6\\'4\", ya know? I didn\\'t know the actual specs on legroom, I was doing more \"wishful thinking\" than anything. I know I\\'m rambling, but car companies should put more front-seat travel in their seat tracks. I sit with the seat all the way back, and anyone under 6\\' has plenty of room behind me. I could go an extra inch or two and have a typical 5\\'4\" person comfortable. I\\'m regularly driving my friends around (it happens when you\\'ve got a roomy car), and extra travel would be appreciated for my guy friends (my three best guy friends are 6\\'4\" 190, 6\\'4\" 320, and 6\\'3\" 250) in the front seat!   Ah, no wonder they don\\'t mention the front leg room specs! Although I can swear I saw multiple reviews mentioning \"more front leg room\" for 2008.IMO that is pretty poor that in a 194\" car, Honda has managed to increase rear legroom by only 4/10 of an inch while decreasing front leg room and making the trunk only 14 cubic feet. In comparison, the 177\" Elantra has more front leg room and about the same trunk space. I thought Honda was good on intelligent packaging. Maybe the Accord engineering team should take some pointers from the Fit team.   How its packaged may make it feel larger than it is. I know my 1996 actually has tight legroom, but it is very open and airy (moreso than my 06) so it doesn\\'t feel too compact.I\\'m not making an excuse, but it may be why some reviewers may have mentioned more front-seat room - it may well seem that way.  The front seat room they commented on seems to be related to extra width--which is mentioned in the various press releases and articles. Maybe a testament to the ever-increasing girth of Americans. :sick:  Doesn\\'t help me much then. I\\'m just tall (6\\'4\", 190). Good thing I\\'ve got an 06; I plan to keep it a long time. Maybe my 2013 the Civic will be as big as an old Accord (1998-2006) and I\\'ll just get one of those. It\\'s already as roomy as my 1996.  Or maybe by 2013 you\\'ll take a serious look at what other auto makers are offering then. Who knows what will be available 6 years from now?  If thegraduate is so happy with his 2 Accords why would he consider anything else but Hondas? Of course, unless if his criteria changes and Honda no longer offers anything that suits his needs...If I am happy with my current car I\\'ll be more than likely to consider the same brand again over any others.It\\'s human nature, stick with what works.  Good thing for Honda and Toyota that lots of GM, Ford, and Chrysler owners didn\\'t follow that advice starting in the \\'70s.   Louiswei is right. I really did look at other automakers before deciding on my 2006; for me, Honda has two MAJOR things in their pocket - interior quality and ride/handling balance. The power/economy ratio was an extra bonus. If Honda starts slacking on one of these MAJOR points (major to me) I\\'ll look much harder elsewhere. For now, having a dealer close by (walking distance, actually), and Honda doing nothing but give me good service (referring to both vehicles and personnel), I don\\'t have a reason not to give them my loyalty.Of course I\\'ll look at other makes each time, but I\\'m starting with a well-earned Honda bias.  Good thing for Honda and Toyota that lots of GM, Ford, and Chrysler owners didn\\'t follow that advice starting in the \\'70s. Because they were not satisfied owning GM, Ford, or Chrysler cars. Honda owners are usually satisfied with what they have, and will buy another one when the time comes. Only problem for Honda is, I keep my cars a long time, so they have to wait a while for this repeat customer.  Looks like Honda\\'s done fine on the ride/handling balance for the \\'08 Accord, but the interior quality could be another story, based on the comment re the quality (or lack thereof) of the base trim\\'s interior. But the higher-end trims seem to have impressive quality. That\\'s too bad if true; one of the great things about getting the Accord DX, VP, or LX in the past is that you were getting basically the same car, interior and all, as in the higher trims (no leather or fancy doo-dads, but the materials were the same). Looks like some de-contenting occuring to keep the price reasonable.I guess I am a dis-loyal car buyer. I buy whatever fits my needs best at the time, for the lowest price. If that\\'s a Honda, I\\'ll gladly buy a Honda such as the Accord. But I\\'m not going to give Honda or any other manufacturer brownie points because one or more of their cars worked for me in the past. I don\\'t see Honda offering me any financial incentive to be loyal to them--a loyalty rebate, for example. So let the best car, at the best price, win my business.  Well I guess my Honda Accord V6 may last a good long time, though I am less than impressed with a couple of noises. First the engine got noisy, as in a rubbing sort of sound to the belts after about a couple thousand miles on her. Had it in twice to be repaired. Makes the same sound. Ask the dealership about it again during the last oil change, and the mechanic said it sounds normal. Well it may for a 1970\\'s American V6, but certainly not by Japan, or Honda standards. I may try another dealership. The other noise, which is only heard when things are really quiet, is the right fender which makes a few ticks or creaks sounds when turning the car. You only hear that in a parking lot or entering a driveway. They repositioned the fender. It makes the same sound.The car performs 100% on the road for handling and comfort. The gas mileage is good. Will I buy another one, not sure. The noise thing gives me a little pause. Will see how the car rates over time. Feature wise, I like everything except auto-express down and up windows, which drive me crazy. Oh add the re-locking of doors after you hit the open in about 30 seconds - kinda crazy thing. Now the auto opening of windows before entry is pretty neat idea to cool the car down and is a real plus. Being a person which has owned lots of different cars, some being Japanese, I am kinda tough on rating my car, so at the present time, I am giving it an 85 to 90% due to engine and fender noises. I did have an independent repairman say he thought the engine sounded OK, but then again, he may have listened to lots of rock n\\' roll over the years, at volume = full. Loren   That\\'s too bad if true; one of the great things about getting the Accord DX, VP, or LX in the past is that you were getting basically the same car, interior and all, as in the higher trims (no leather or fancy doo-dads, but the materials were the same). Looks like some de-contenting occuring to keep the price reasonable. I know in 92 the interior seat and trim fabric was different from LX to EX. It was the same color, but not the same quality material. I think the floor mats were stronger in the EX also.  What about those saying the New Civic is much the size of the Old Accord and thus for 2008 it may be time to consider a downsizing? Is the Civic large enough? I have the \\'07 Accord, and see absolutely no need for it to be larger, as it is slightly larger than the Cadillac CTS right now. I think I am drawing the line at this size now. Oh what do I know, when I had a Miata, I also had \"my bigger car\", the Corolla. :blush: I think the \\'98 Corolla was a bit too small. Actually the Miata is like getting into a glove, but then again, it is a sports car -- different game ya know. As a side note, the new Miata could have been made with a little more hip room and the seats got more narrow than the previous models, which was in my mind a big mistake, in a SUPER-SIZED America. L  Its not so much loyalty as peace of mind. With Hondas I feel like I know what I am getting. If I felt differently after sitting in and driving the vehicle, I wouldn\\'t be so quick to buy it.I can get a vibe about a car pretty early on (how the doors close, how it handles, how the controls feel).  I guess the tech was too lazy to figure out what was causing the noise. The loudest sounds I hear from my V6 are the fuel injectors clicking, and that\\'s not very loud.  I was not impressed with the New Camry interior. I would think Honda would not make the same mistake as Toyota after seeing the response from the press and public. It is far from the worst, but not up to Japan standards. What\\'s up with fake silver aluminum, which looks like a cheap China radio boom box? I don\\'t know what you think, but to me plastic aluminum ranks right up there with what is the worst for interiors.L  A Miata! Isn\\'t that a \"chick car\"? Just kidding. What\\'s up with fake silver aluminum, which looks like a cheap China radio boom box? I here you. The Harmon Kardon receiver and cassette deck I had back in 84 was that color. It\\'s been out of style for a while now, I think.  They have replaced the belt and wheels assembly thing. Seems to be louder once warmed and after using air conditioning. There is an another dealership to try and another repair shop which specializes in Hondas to have look at it. So your Honda makes no loud belt noise which can be heard without the hood open???L  From my ownership experiences, I know what I think I\\'m getting with a Honda, but also a Toyota, Mazda, Nissan, Hyundai, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, and Ford. (Been too long since I owned a GM car.) But times change, cars change. As you implied, it depends on what the car is like now, and I will add how it compares to others, and at what cost.I am sure the new Accord is a fantastic family sedan, maybe the best in the class right now. But having something that others consider \"best in class\" ceased to be important to me a long time ago, if I have to pay a lot extra to have it.  So your Honda makes no loud belt noise which can be heard without the hood open??? I can barely hear anything without the hood open. When it\\'s open injectors, are the dominant sound. Even the clicking seems to quiet down after a few minutes.  Well if pure sales were a guide (and yes, including rentals), the Camry would be seen as \"best-in-class\" by most people\\'s standards (it was best in class to them because they bought it!). I completely disagreed; it was too soft, too numb, and too dull for me to consider it for very long.You and I likely have a very different idea of best in class; basically, I agree with you though. Buying because others feel a car is \"best-in-class\" is like buying pants because they fit on someone else. Different people have different standards (some prefer big, some prefer small; some prefer soft, some prefer firm; etc...)In that sense, we compeltely agree backy. Whoulda thunk it? The slant H guy and the straight H guy can get along! :shades:  Ah, that\\'s the deal. Honda is giving good discounts on the \\'07 model Accord, and thus I got mine for less than the Aura XR. And this is months ago. I bet another grand is taken off the price now. The Saturn Aura XR was fun to drive and all, but the price was higher -- they did not deal with me on the trade-in allowance. Net price out the door was gonna be a lot more with the Saturn. I got the best price at the second Honda dealership for a quote. The first one was crazy on the trade-in, while the second one got it right. And then I got another $1,500 off on the car. Anyway, the Honda prices are low -- find the right dealership.If a person like the CVT, the Altima looks kinda interesting. I dislike the stange foot brake location though and the CVT.L  Oh no- not the chick car thing. Try to convince people the Miata is a track car compared to the BMWZ3, SLK, Solstice or Sky, and many just don\\'t understand. And yes, it makes for a good little secretary or commuter car too. For handling, I am thinking Miata again, maybe the second gen, or Bimmer for a little more room, nice engine and roll bars and aggressive look the BMW Z3 is good, but can not match handling. The Solstice has the looks, but no roll bar - not a place to put a roll bar, and it is kinda a bathtub feel to the driving position with those too tall doors.OK back to mid-sized cars. I guess something positive can be said for most all of these cars in this class. They all have something for someone. I may be what is the most important elements to an individual nowadays, more so than the old this is good car, and that one is a bad car, which did make life more simple :blush: For resale, we all know the leaders, so debate there is useless. If resale doesn\\'t matter, the rest is all in what ya see a car as. - Loren  For resale, we all know the leaders, so debate there is useless.Huh? Resale is very important to the guy that likes a new car every 3 years or less - like me. I like to buy cars somewhat under my wearwithall but dump \\'em every 2-3 years, so resale value keeps me from having to pony up much money when I sign for the next one. I rarely lease.After 6+ years or so resale values become moot (except for maybe trucks and some boutique type cars)  In a way, yeah, in 6 years resale value is less important. If you happen to own a Corolla or Civic though, you may be pleasantly surprised at the retained value even in 10 years, with higher miles. They will still buy them, at least in Ca. with high miles and many years. Much harder to sell an old domestic. I still think domestics make a good used car buy, or even a new car buy, if it is something special you really are after, and plan to keep it awhile. Old rule with me was Japan new, Domestics used. Problem is the rule was NOT old enough, and I bought a lot of NEW domestic cars which did not sell well. I must say the Mustang was a good enough trade-in value. Mustangs use to do well -- perhaps still do.L  Resale is very important to the guy that likes a new car every 3 years or less - like me. I like to buy cars somewhat under my wearwithall but dump \\'em every 2-3 years, so resale value keeps me from having to pony up much money when I sign for the next one. I rarely lease.Seems to me you are loosing a lot of $$$ on depreciation (on any car) in the first 3 years, and getting a car that hasn\\'t really improved that much over the 3 year old model.  I hardly ever sell a car. I think of the 13 cars I\\'ve owned only 3 have been re-sold and these were all sold for a few hundred bucks. So resale value has been of little concern for me. It took me about 18 mo. of off and on shopping and research to buy my last car. So if I were to trade every 2-3 years, I\\'d probably be perpetually working on buying/selling cars. I have never been able to bring myself to buy used, unless it was a cheap car. Most I ever paid for a used car was $3800 in Dec. 2000. Buying a 1-3 year old car and supposedly saving a lot on depreciation sounds good on paper, but I have never gotten the impression that it would work that well in reality...at least for me. Saving in the neighborhood of $4000 to get a car with maybe 20,000-30,000 miles on it, is not enough compensation for going with a used car for me. The idea of buying a higher priced used car from a private seller makes me nervous.  Where do you park all the cars? Drive a different old car each day? As for used, I would say if bought for 1/2 the original cost, or less, is the way to go for used. American cars are usually the best deals in used. I did find an excellent 6 year old Miata some years back. It was about a third the current Miata price, and had 36K miles on it. Sometimes Japan and German good buys can be found.L  I didn\\'t say I had kept all those cars from my 30 years of car ownership, just that they were not sold. Some were junked, some were donated, a couple were given to kids.  I guess we will find out about the \"super Honda resale value\" in a few years, I don\\'t see myself in the \\'07 Accord EX for more than 3 or 5 years if I can help it; I am hoping by then I can get something more fun.The old Accord (1993/145k)seems to be about 2k on craigslist around here. We will see how that goes.  Seems to me you are loosing a lot of $$$ on depreciation (on any car) in the first 3 years, and getting a car that hasn\\'t really improved that much over the 3 year old model.Last 2 vehicles - a 2000 Camry and a 2002 Accord. Bought \\'em for a great price, no money down, 5 year financing, traded \\'em in and got the payoff as trade-in value - no upsidedownness carried to the next vehicle.My current ride is a TL. Bought it for less than what Edmunds suggested, no money down, 5 year financing (787 FICO score).And I\\'m not buying the same model car each time. I like to try \\'em all. Waiting to see the HunDye Genesis. Hopefully that car won\\'t upset my pattern.  Wouldn\\'t lease payments be lower than the 5 year finance payments? It\\'s your $$$, so if you really want the freedom to sell/trade whenever the urge strikes (even if it\\'s less than 3 years) it\\'s the only option.   I don\\'t see Honda offering me any financial incentive to be loyal to them--a loyalty rebate, for example. So let the best car, at the best price, win my business. It\\'s an unwritten rebate issued as knowing and having peace of mind that your car will never break down or require tow truck services for over 200,000 to 300,000 miles with proper maintenance. The finanicial incentive is that you won\\'t have to spend money on mechanics and replacement parts (I must have spent thousands on MOPAR replacement parts alone).So in order to have your viewpoint and outlook, you have to ignore decades of reliability data. :surprise:  The car performs 100% on the road for handling and comfort. The gas mileage is good. Will I buy another one, not sure. The noise thing gives me a little pause. Will see how the car rates over time. Blame those \"rookies\" in Ohio........ They will never be as good or as talented as the Honda workers in Japan, but in time (maybe another 5 years) they will get really good. A lot of the workers in Japan have been assembling Honda\\'s for decades, or even their whole career and most of their lives; hard to compete with that.  If someone rearends and totals your 1 or 2 year old car, your Insurance Company will make you care about resale value a whole lot!!!!   It\\'s an unwritten rebate issued as knowing and having peace of mind that your car will never break down or require tow truck services for over 200,000 to 300,000 I\\'d love to take you on a tour of garages sometime. Might take the blinders off your eyesI hate to be the one to break it to you, but yes, Honda cars do in fact break down from time to time.  If someone rearends and totals your 1 or 2 year old car, your Insurance Company will make you care about resale value a whole lot!!!!Well, not a lot but a at least a little. Whatever the insurance would pay should be enough to buy a car of similar age an condition. But, I would care a little as I might want to replace it with new, which is why I say resale is of little (as opposed to no) concern.  Last 2 vehicles - a 2000 Camry and a 2002 Accord. Bought \\'em for a great price, no money down, 5 year financing, traded \\'em in and got the payoff as trade-in value - no upsidedownness carried to the next vehicle.I would guess that this means you are paying around $300-350 per month. If so, that seems like a pretty high cost for owning a car. Also, despite being Accord and Camry, that depreciation seems pretty high at an average of about 20% per year for the few years you own them.  That is why there is GAP insurance. If someone is upside down on payments (assuming payments are up to date) GAP insurance will pay the difference between the cars value and the loan payoff amount. In CT where I live, state law requires insurance companies to pay RETAIL value (which is better than resale value) when a car is totaled. My 28 month old \\'05 Sonata is worth about $3500 less than I paid for it in April, \\'05 according to NADA. That\\'s not a bad depreciation hit at all. Anyone should check with their car insurance company about GAP insurance before buying GAP through the dealer. I\\'m an insurance agent and have seen hundreds of dollars of saving for my clients by getting insurance company GAP vs dealer GAP.  Wouldn\\'t lease payments be lower than the 5 year finance payments? It\\'s your $$$, so if you really want the freedom to sell/trade whenever the urge strikes (even if it\\'s less than 3 years) it\\'s the only option. Exactly why I usually lease. I don\\'t keep cars long and I prefer the lower payments that can go with that. I did buy my Mustang after I \"sold\" my leased Mazda6 to the Ford dealer for the amount of the remaining balance on the lease. There were 7 remaining months, out of 36 total, on that Mazda lease so you\\'re not necessarily bound to the length of a lease if you don\\'t want to be. I could have sold it myself too and made a profit but I didn\\'t want the hassle.Lease companies may differ in how they handle those situations but Mazda was very clear in what I could and couldn\\'t do and they made it very easy for the Ford dealer to buy my lease out and therefore own the car. I drove home in the Mustang the very same day I went to look at it. It was that seamless.  The best value deal is the SE V6 Accord. Has some good equipment value to it, it is being discounted right now, and is rated better than the EX for total turnaround or cost to own over the years, by Intellichoice. It is a good deal. IF you are thinking Accord, of all those I looked at the SE V6 stood out for value in the sedan.L  Yes, but if your going to waste the extra money on GAP insurance payments, why not just put aside the payments in a high interest yielding account and pay for the \"gap\" yourself??? For that matter, why not just use the extra money you put towards GAP insurance towards buying a better vehicle that doesn\\'t fall apart and lose its value quickly??Also, using any guide like NADA and Kelly Blue Book is a slippery slope with Insurance Companies. Insurance likes to look at ACTUAL Cash value, meaning what those cars are REALLY selling for.  Yes, you can find a Honda broken down in a garage, but it\\'s a one in a million shot.  GAP *is required* by some lenders for lease deals.  One in a million shot? Lesseee now... the last Honda I owned was \"broken down\", i.e. major components inoperable, twice. Since I appear to be good at beating the odds, maybe I should go down to my local casino, or buy some lottery tickets.Take off the rose-colored glasses for a minute and notice that Hondas do break down. And they break down regardless of whether I\\'ve owned one before. So much for your idea of a \"loyalty rebate.\" I\\'ll take the cold cash for a loyalty rebate, thank you.One question comes to mind wrt the 2008 Accord: Honda has had more problems than normal lately with the first year or so of a new design (see: 1999 Odyssey; 2001 Civic; 2003 Accord; 2006 Civic for example). So I wonder how the new Accord will fare for reliability? Or will only 1/2 of one 2008 Accord (or about one in a million) have a significant problem?  One question comes to mind wrt the 2008 Accord: Honda has had more problems than normal lately with the first year or so of a new design (see: 1999 Odyssey; 2001 Civic; 2003 Accord; 2006 Civic for example). So I wonder how the new Accord will fare for reliability? Or will only 1/2 of one 2008 Accord (or about one in a million) have a significant problem? What problem have you discovered with my 03 Accord, that I have obviously failed to notice?  Andres, how does $28 per year for an option package offered by one of the insurance companies I represent sound to you? That $28 option includes lease GAP, up to $3,000 rental car, OEM replacement parts until car is 5 model years old, replacement of accidental air bag deployment, $100 lock & key service, plus a couple other things. Would a high interest yielding account pay for any GAP if I front ended the first year\\'s $28 payment if I were upside down on the loan? How much more car would $28 per year for 5 years buy? And, my \\'05 Sonata GLS SV is no where\\'s near falling apart. It hasn\\'t had to have anything fixed or adjusted. I\\'d guess that a typical new Honda has decreased in value by at least $3500 in the same 28 month period.You seem to be totally ignorant regarding GAP insurance. GAP insurance does not apply to a car\\'s reliability, it only applies to physical damage claims that \"total\" a car. Actual Cash Value means \"replacement cost less depreciation.\" In CT, as I posted earlier, the law defines \"replacement cost\" as \"retail value\" and further specifies that \"NADA\" and one other recognized source\\'s value will be averaged to determine the retail value. These other sources can include KBB retail value or newspaper ads from dealerships for used cars of the same make, year and model of car.  You heard about the mass recall of the \\'03 Accord for auto transmission problems, right? Glad that your Accord was not affected, since the transmission gear failure (subject of the recall action) could result in transmission lockup, which could result in a crash (according to the recall notice).  \"It\\'s an unwritten rebate issued as knowing and having peace of mind that your car will never break down or require tow truck services for over 200,000 to 300,000\"\"I\\'d love to take you on a tour of garages sometime. Might take the blinders off your eyes.\"\"I hate to be the one to break it to you, but yes, Honda cars do in fact break down from time to time.\"I agree, the last two vehicles I have observed either being towed or dead on the side of the road were Accords - just today. Brand loyalty is one thing, but \"blind\" loyalty is something I simply don\\'t understand. Any mass produced product made by a human being will break down, including a Honda.  You heard about the mass recall of the \\'03 Accord for auto transmission problems, right?Yes, of course I have heard of the recall. The recall was done on my car, and unlike many other companies recall fixes, it worked like a charm. No one has opened my hood but myself since then. I sure haven\\'t been hearing of many 03 Accord transmission failures since then. On the other hand, if I brought my Chevy truck in for every recall listed for it, it would be at the dealership more than at my house. Recalls aren\\'t a problem, when the fix works.  Or another way to say it is, recalls aren\\'t a problem if they are on a Honda, right? Just because your car was fixed before it left you stranded on the road (or worse), doesn\\'t mean it didn\\'t happen to many other Accord owners. Too bad they didn\\'t qualify for that Honda \"loyalty rebate.\" :sick:  Let me say this, as a 2-Accord owner who has no problem saying he loves both of his cars...Honda is a large company, just like any other in this forum.Honda makes good cars that please lots of customers, just like any other in this forum.Honda makes its share of mistakes and has its share of issues to work through, just (say it with me) like any other in this forum.Hondas are cars made by imperfect beings, people. Are they typically ahead of the curve on reliability? Many reports say yes. It doesn\\'t make them perfect though; far from it. Let\\'s quit pretending like Honda wears a halo and has only a \"1 in a million\" shot of being a shop. They don\\'t. I have a 1996 Accord that has 175k miles, and has cost relatively little to keep running. I also have a 2006 Accord with 24,100 miles, and it had more problems (2) than my 1996 had in an entire year last year. The problems were minor (a loose interior rear-view mirror and a gas flap that needed some little rubber piece plopped back into place). Still, not perfect, and not any more or less than I\\'d expect from any one of its competitors.  Grad, that\\'s a voice of reason; love your cars but realize, like all cars, that they are not perfect. I even saw a Rolls broken down on I-95 years ago in one of the Carolinas or Virginia. There are a couple posters here who still insist than anything other than Accord or Camry are junk. As a proud/pleased Accord owner, you recognize that all car are not for everybody and that there are many good choices available.Our \\'07 Sonata (company car) which my brother drives has been great for 8K miles, whatever he has driven it. In fact, at least once a week, he tells me how great a car it is after having it for a little over six months. My \\'05 Sonata is still great and a pleasure to drive (requiring no fixes) since new 28 months ago.  Maybe that Honda went the 301K \\'th mile, then died. Just a thought :shades: I see in Consumer Reports of several years for transmission problems. Seems it was for the V6 models. Things happen, and this time it was happening to Honda. Oh well, it is not like one doesn\\'t spot a whole lot of black dots on the pages on Consumer Reports for GM, Ford, Mercedes, Saab, and well most of the rest. I do note more solid red dots come to view when looking at the pages of Honda cars. Funny how that happens.L  Well, I bought a Honda because of the qualities Honda bakes into its cars (the interior design/fit/finish, the handling and ride balance, and the suh-WEET engine ). Not becuase \"It\\'s a Honda.\"Of course, the class-leading resale and reputation for reliability is a plus, but the reliability thing means above average, not perfect.I think it is pretty reasonable too, but then again, I\\'ve never argued with myself!   The life story of a 1990 Honda Accord EX Automatic, bought brand new by a married couple for the wife to commute to work in.The original owners put 100,000 miles on the car in 9 years before deciding to upgrade. They listed the car for sale privately in 1999, when I purchased it to commute to college in.During my ownership over the next 2.5 years and 40,000 miles, the car did have quite a few moderate problems. Right off the top of my head:-on the drive home, noticed a strange high-pitched scraping noise, turned out to be the distributer-intake manifold became clogged, resulting in increased intake noise and reduced performance; shop had to drill holes-starter solenoid failed; car would not start when interior was hot, had to open doors/hood for it to cool before it would crank-igniter failed; while driving, all power accesories including gauges went dead, car kept running until shut off then wouldn\\'t start again-power door lock module failedI sold this car privately in 2001. Last year, I emailed the third owner and asked her what became of the car. She stated that she drove the car with no major problems until \"well over 200 thousand miles\" but that everything was starting to go at that point, including the transmission. She traded it in to a dealer in 2004, and who knows what happened to it then.So all in all, that car was pretty reliable throughout it\\'s life. Evidently I just had the bad spot, but hey nothing major failed. No engine/tranny rebuilds, etc.Now I bought a brand new Accord. I\\'ll be happy if it is as reliable throughout it\\'s life as the 1990 was.  Nicely said:Let\\'s quit pretending like Honda wears a halo and has only a \"1 in a million\" shot of being a shop. They don\\'t.   >to a dealer in 2004, and who knows what happened to it then. If you have the VIN number from an insurance policy (your agent probably has records), a service writeup, an old registration, I\\'d check a carfax or other tracking record for it just to see what happened. Ohio has a state website where VINs can be checked for cursory records on cars in their system, e.g., free.I\\'ve often wondered how long my 89 Century and 93 leSabre went after my wife made me trade them.  I saw a post within last coupl\\'a days in a Honda discussion here on Edmunds by an Accord owner about his front fender popping when turning into the driveway. I\\'ll bet it\\'s the early problem with welds in the firewall/A post area from the 03\\'s. His was an 05 or 06 however. Naaah. It couldn\\'t be. Honda would have fixed those the day they found their welds were insufficient. :sick:  I\\'ll bet it\\'s the early problem with welds in the firewall/A post area from the 03\\'s. His was an 05 or 06 however. Naaah. It couldn\\'t be. Honda would have fixed those the day they found their welds were insufficient.Now lets not forget about how Honda also called all owners with affected copies into the shop so they could get their welds fixed for free too. While it was in there I\\'m sure they hooked everyone up with a new tranny, timing belt, brake pads, muffler, etc. too. You know, standard Honda service stuff. :P  >new tranny, timing belt, brake pads, muffler, etc. too. You know, standard Honda service stuff.AND they didn\\'t let the owner know all the other parts had been replaced to correct \"errors\" and the owners think their cars never needed any service for problems like all those \"other\" cars do when problems pop up. :blush:  Soooo I guess Honda should shut down their service and repair facilities at all their dealerships...wow think of all the savings. What a great idea and all those unemployed Honda techs. can find jobs where? probably according to your skewed rationale at Hyundai...right? Yeah sure, last time I checked not one dealer in my (or anyone elses) area has closed their service dept. due to a lack of business.  So now the pendulum swings the other way. Sigh. People get mad at the Honda fans for being so blindly loyal that it sounds a bit ridiculous. Then thegrad speaks with reason and the pendulum swings back so that the Honda bashers are sounding ridiculous. :P What\\'s the point of egging each other on?  Once upon a time (it seems like long ago) a mid-size sedan forum would have been dominated by the theme which is best, Ford or Chevy. Now it\\'s Honda and Toyota versus the rest of the field. The more things change, the more they stay the same.There are loyalists -- and detractors -- on both sides of the aisle. It\\'s safe to say, I believe, that Honda and Toyota have built some fine automobiles over the last two decades. I believe it is equally true that the competition has gotten a lot keener in the last five years.In its heyday, the Ford Taurus absolutely dominated the mid-size sedan segment but Ford failed to keep pace with the market and let the Taurus die on the vine.The Fusion is the new Taurus, although the new Taurus is an old Five Hundred and now a full-size sedan. Except for horrific 14.8 mpg in-city gas mileage, our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion has been perfect for nine months and 4,321 miles. Knock on wood.Only time will tell if the Fusion proves to be as reliable as an Accord or Camry. So far, so good. Nary a recall. Not a single rattle, squeak or other malady. I believe Ford has produced a genuine winner in the Fusion, definitely equal to the Accord and Camry but with better styling and handling at a better price.Just my 2 cents worth.  So now the pendulum swings the other way. Sigh. People get mad at the Honda fans for being so blindly loyal that it sounds a bit ridiculous. Then thegrad speaks with reason and the pendulum swings back so that the Honda bashers are sounding ridiculous. I dunno, but I\\'m kind of afraid to talk now!   Blame those \"rookies\" in Ohio........ They will never be as good or as talented as the Honda workers in JapanUmmm, those \"rookies\" have been building the Accord for 25+ years :confuse:  \"There are a couple posters here who still insist than anything other than Accord or Camry are junk.\"That\\'s not exactly the way I think. I\\'m not interested in purchasing/leasing any other car in this segment for one reason or another, other than an Accord.That\\'s different than saying they are all junk.  Yes, you can find a Honda broken down in a garage, but it\\'s a one in a million shot. Not too sure about that... My buddy\\'s 02 Accord EX-V6(Please die already) Died while driving - bad tranny. Rebuilt it (at his expense). Died again. New tranny (again, his expense) and it\\'s slipping already. 68k miles. Please die already. And the sad thing is that he wants the 08 Accord.  I have a friend who bought new in 2002 Camry XLE I4 auto and replaced the Toyota emblem on hood at about 5000, the water pump at about 18000, driver-side door stripping at about 25,000 and now has a rubbing sound from steering mechanism at about 50,000. I know there has been a couple of other repairs but I can\\'t remember what they were. Point is, it has been a good car but it\\'s not perfect.  The question is does he say something like his car has been reliable, except for a couple minor transmission problems?   Except for horrific 14.8 mpg in-city gas mileage, our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion has been perfect for nine months and 4,321 miles.I looked at Fusions when I was buying last year and only barely chose an Accord. I think the Fusions are good looking cars with good content.I am blown away by the mileage you report though.You are getting similar mileage to a full-size SUV out of a mid-size sedan. I would not be happy with that by any means.Do you expect it to improve? If not why stay in a sedan at all when you can get twice the space with the same mileage in something bigger?  $28/year sounds really cheap for ANY option from an Insurance company, you sure that\\'s not based on a 1990 Kia Sephia?What if you have zero down on a 72 month loan on a new BMW 335i? I\\'m fully aware GAP has nothing to do with reliability, but covers the amount you owe vs. what your car is worth. GAP ceases to be useful if you stick to cars that have great resale and don\\'t buy with no money down. Cars that have great resale TEND to be, and USUALLY are very reliable, so they are inherently indirectly related.  Boz (urnews) only drives very short trips with lots of stop-n-go. It\\'s not the vehicle in this case - it\\'s the driving. So while an I4 would help he\\'ll never hit the EPA mileage estimates.  That\\'s not exactly the way I thinkIt may not be the way you think but it\\'s certainly the way you type.  If you looked at why the service shop is so full of Honda\\'s, you\\'d see they are all there for oil changes and other regular maintenance.  our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion has been perfect for nine months and 4,321 milesJeez - I hope so. 4321 miles in 9 months? I do that in 2 months easy.The 2 Fusions I test drove just seemed adequate whereas Accords and the new Sonata were at a different level altogether.And what\\'s with the funky turn signal stalk at 10:00 on the Fusion? Weird.  I am blown away by the mileage you report though.You are getting similar mileage to a full-size SUV out of a mid-size sedan. I would not be happy with that by any means.Do you expect it to improve? If not why stay in a sedan at all when you can get twice the space with the same mileage in something bigger?The mileage culprit, I believe, is the all-wheel drive and the type of driving, as Allen Kirky noted. Even our 2000 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder, automatic transmission Ford Focus station wagon only averages 17-19 mpg over the same route.But I certainly agree that 14.8 mpg is the pits for a mid-size sedan. It does yield 24-24 mpg on trips however and the revised EPA estimate for this drive train is 17 mpg city and 24 mpg highway.We really like everything about the vehicle except for the poor gas mileage. If I\\'d had any inkling whatsoever that the mileage was going to be this bad I would have bought something else.A mid-size sedan is plenty large enough for our purposes (and most people\\'s). In retrospect, a 4-cylinder engine would have been a better choice. It might not have equaled the EPA estimate in our driving circumstances but it would certainly do better than the 14.8 we are constantly getting.Since we have 4,300 miles on the car, I don\\'t expect any improvement either. It\\'s a bitter pill but it is still a fine automobile otherwise.  The 2 Fusions I test drove just seemed adequate whereas Accords and the new Sonata were at a different level altogether.And what\\'s with the funky turn signal stalk at 10:00 on the Fusion? Weird.We didn\\'t test drive an Accord or Sonata. Considered the Accord to be too expensive. Same dealer sells them both in our burg and we liked our Ford, Lincoln, Mercury dealer (Sherwood of Salisbury) better.Wife also wanted a Mustang (not practical) but was willing to settle for a Fusion. You know how that goes. Plus, styling was a big factor. We both liked the looks of the Fusion better than the other mid-size sedans.Yeah, the 10 o\\'clock turn signal stalk was a bit weird at first but we like it now.So, what did you buy, an Accord or a Sonata? How do you like it?  If I\\'d had any inkling whatsoever that the mileage was going to be this bad...Well...sorry, but I\\'d have to say that getting 17-19 mpg in a 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder, automatic transmission Ford Focus station wagon should have given you more than an inkling of what to expect in a V6 AWD Fusion. Your Focus Wagon would have had about 26 city listed on the sticker and you were getting 17-19. The Fusion had 19 city on the sticker, you should reasonably have expected to get 7-9 mpg less or alternatively you should have expected about 70% of that figure, based on your Focus. Those expectations would have led you to expect maybe 13 mpg at best. You should be actually be happy that your Fusion is doing better than the Focus relative to its EPA rating  I have to agree with you 100% here. If you have already owned a Ford and it delivered poor gas mileage under the old EPA rating, and then you went out and bought another Ford, you should have known there was a strong liklihood of repeat poor performance.You don\\'t buy Ford\\'s to get good gas mileage.  But much more importantly, how long have those 25 year Ohio (has it really been that long?) Honda workers been building V6 Accords? Or even better still, V6 Accords with more than 200 HP?  Ever stop to think that maybe the transmission mechanic he\\'s going to is incompetent? Not Honda\\'s fault at all (except the initial tranny).  \"Not too sure about that... My buddy\\'s 02 Accord EX-V6(Please die already) Died while driving - bad tranny. Rebuilt it (at his expense). Died again. New tranny (again, his expense) and it\\'s slipping already. 68k miles. Please die already. And the sad thing is that he wants the 08 Accord:\"Honda extended the transmission warranty on all 1998-2002 Accords to 100k miles; why did he pay out of pocket? Sounds suspicious; not that it didn\\'t happen, but that he had to pay for it.  Well I happen not to think highly of Nissan, Saturn, Ford, Kia, Hyundai or Mazda. If it shows in my typing then I\\'m being honest. I\\'ve had bad experiences with Nissan and Ford, I don\\'t believe though, I called them junk.  You know andres, you\\'d avoid a lot of heat if you didn\\'t make such broad stroke statements like \"all Hondas in a shop are there for other maintenance.\"It\\'s not true buddy, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m beginning to wonder if you are actually serious about some of the statements you post, or if you are just trying to incite a riot (of laughter). I\\'m from a full-blooded Honda family (one grandmother has a 97 Civic LX, the other an \\'02 Accord LX, my mom and dad have an \\'07 Civic EX, my great aunt has an \\'05 Odyssey EX, and I have two Accords.Guess what? Hondas CAN have problems, just like Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai, Ford, etc... They AREN\\'T all in for maintenance. My grandparents just had their alternator replaced at 110,000 miles on the Civic, and my 1996 had an emissions recall performed at 88,000 miles because it caused 02 sensors to go bad. Our 2000 Odyssey had more rattles than any vehicle I\\'ve ridden in, and my dad\\'s 2003 Accord had to have the headliner replaced in order to fix a rattle; not to mention the LCD display failure at 30k miles.Hondas are wonderful cars, but its competitors can be just as wonderful if you prefer their characteristics. I just happen to like Honda\\'s attributes and \"better than average\" reliability. If I wanted perfect reliability, I\\'d have to walk, and even then my bad knee would probably put me down to \"average\"   You don\\'t buy Ford\\'s to get good gas mileage. oh COME ON man!It\\'s obvious that his route is the culprit of his poor mileage. You are taking every opporutnity to make an invalid argument against Ford (or, in simpler terms - BASH).I dont have a Ford, I don\\'t plan on buying one soon, but this is getting CRAZY.  I don\\'t think I was out of line, Ford has never been known to get good gas mileage. Honda and Toyota have always been known for that. His mileage is POORER than normal due to his driving habits/route, but I guarantee you if he had the V6 Accord he could floor it everywhere he ever went at every stoplight, and he\\'d probably get the same mileage, if not better.I\\'ve never owned a Ford, but my impression from other\\'s Fords, my friends Ford from a while back, a really old Escort, and other friends of friends is that they are junk; except of course, there stuff from maybe the last 2 years.  No one is saying Honda\\'s are perfect (especially the USA built ones) but they are really good, far above average.And not only that, the problems you have (even as you describe with your family and friends) are all very minor both in hassle and cost (trust me on this). One question: how many times have you called a tow truck in to move your Hondas?  I don\\'t mean to throw fuel on any particular fire, but here is an interesting article I found out of curiosity comparing warranty costs from the larger manufacturers. The numbers are not broken down on a per vehicle basis. One would have to determine the approximate number of vehicles still under warranty coverage per manufacturer during the the period in question.http://www.financialweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070820/REG/70817026/10- 36  A very interesting article, ergsum. Thanks for the link.  Additional info.http://www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20060620.html  Its much more than one in a million, my offer still stands, I\\'ll take you around some garages show you reality.   It\\'s not true buddy, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m beginning to wonder if you are actually serious about some of the statements you post, or if you are just trying to incite a riot (of laughter). I think its the latter, but everybody understands that by now. But your point is right on grad. I had a sentra go 220k with no work, have a 200sx with 147k thats never needed fixed, and thats the reason I bought my alti. But, I know nissan\\'s break down, I\\'ve seen plenty in shops and being towed, and once in awhile one on the road. It\\'s one of the reasons I\\'ve come to believe most cars are built of fairly equal quality. They just need to be taken care of. Treat your baby right, and she\\'ll treat you right. It\\'s worked for me over 3 nissan\\'s, 1 honda, and about 500k miles.  The \\'02s were know to have issues with their tranny. Its likely that the tranny in the \\'08 Accords will be fine as its nothing new. The VCM V6 though is something I would be concerned about.Now if one wants the crown jewel of 4-cylinder motivated sedans, then one needs to look no further, this is Honda territory all the way.  Hondas are wonderful cars, but its competitors can be just as wonderful if you prefer their characteristics. Great observation. Sometimes we lose sight of the point that each buyer must choose the car that fits his or her needs, not our personal criteria. So while an Accord, Camry, Mazda6, Sonata et. al. may be just the right car for you or me, it won\\'t be right for everyone. If we would all respect each other\\'s choices this discussion (and the world maybe) would be a better place.  Yeah, the 10 o\\'clock turn signal stalk was a bit weird at first but we like it now. This is from the company that in the 1980\\'s put the horn on the turn signal.  I\\'ve never even noticed that the turn signal stalk is at 10 o\\'clock instead of 9 and I\\'ve never had a problem reaching it.  I would concur that Ford engines historically may not be as fuel efficient as others, but . . . I just spent 5 days and 1,400 miles in brand new 2008 Taurus (aka old Five Hundred, and yes, it was a Hertz rental) with the new 3.5L DOHC V6, and 6-speed automatic. 85% highway and 15% city with the trunk and backseat loaded with tradeshow material for my business trip. Combined mileage was 28.8MPG - not bad for such a large and heavy car. And, I didn\\'t drive 65 on the highway either - typically 70 to 80, with a couple of blasts far above either. How far on a practically uninhabited interstate in KY, I won\\'t say, but suffice to say Ford\\'s new 3.5L DOHC V6 has some serious get up and go, unlike the old 3.0L Duratec.  Ok then lets narrow it down to MY specific 2006 Civic then which has been in the shop for oil changes has ALSO been there for repairs and or replacement of parts under warranty. So, nope I for one certainly don\\'t buy your rather ridiculous claims and would bet no one else here does either.  There is a new rumor that the 09 Fusion will get the 3.5L V6 after all, which sounds like a change from the original plans for only a revised 3.0L V6. Looking at 2008 EPA numbers:2008 Taurus 18/282008 Accord V6 18/292008 Camry V6 19/28Given that the Fusion is 340 lbs lighter than the Taurus and assuming it does get the 3.5L V6 I would expect it to get at least 18/28 or possibly 19/29. With 268 HP this would put the Fusion on a level playing field again. And if more hp becomes necessary, Ford will have a 3.7L version and direct injection available.Of course only Ford has AWD to enable that much power to reach the ground without massive torque steer so I don\\'t see how the Camcords could handle 300 hp even if it was available.  With a number of assumptions in the case of Honda and Toyota, they come up with the following warranty costs per unit at your link:That would imply that Toyota is paying around $265 per vehicle in warranty claims and Honda is paying out around $330 per automobile. That\\'s considerably less than Ford\\'s $585 or GM\\'s $512, not to mention DaimlerChrysler\\'s $1,370 per vehicle. Taking Ford vs. Honda, assuming the difference is spread over the three year warranty period this comes to an $85 per year difference. BTW, this is in the same balpark as the ~$50 difference in repair costs that edmunds estimates for year 5 in their true cost to own figures for Accord vs. Fusion.Cost differences of under $100 per year are not enough for me to choose one vehicle over another. I\\'d might want to stay away from Chysler based on this information, though...but they had nothing of interest (to me) to begin with anyway.(Note to Andre...Honda\\'s figure is not $0 :surprise: )  While I don\\'t doubt for a minute that overall Toyota produces more reliable vehicles than GM, it\\'s hard to compare these numbers due to vehicle mix. I\\'d bet GM\\'s trucks and SUVs are more expensive to warranty than a Yaris or Camry. It would be interesting to see what the warranty costs are on each model line. One model with a huge quality problem can throw the whole thing off, like what happened to Ford a few years ago with the Powerstroke diesel that I believe cost them over a $1billion alone in warranty costs.  Given that SH-AWD is working its way into all of Acura\\'s lineup, I would imagine they will let it trickle to Honda in due time as well, especially if they have a problem to correct in the future such as torque steer.Honda has it, they just aren\\'t using it yet.  (Note to Andre...Honda\\'s figure is not $0 ) LOL  One question: how many times have you called a tow truck in to move your Hondas?1. Radiator failure2. Main relay failure3. Master cylinder failure4. Distributor failure 5. Clutch slave cylinder failure6. Starter failure7. Ignition switch failureAll within the first 10 yrs/100k. The distributor failed again but it was after 100k so I didn\\'t count it.  My Contour with the 2.5l duratec and MTX75 would get 26-27 in mixed driving, slightly better than the EPA estimates. I used to get frustrated when I couldn\\'t get 30 mpg on trips, but then I realized highway MPG was listed at 27 and I was getting 29 and change.Given that in the last few months you\\'ve only accrued about 4k, I don\\'t think an additional fuel cost is really impacting anything that much.  To help even the mix a little, I\\'ll tell when I\\'ve had to have it towed.Once, and it was the dealer\\'s fault.In June, I had a hairline crack in the top of the radiator. I had the radiator replaced, without it ever overheating on me; never leaving me stranded.The dealer didn\\'t clamp the hose tightly on the bottom of the radiator, however, and it came loose, losing all of its coolant. Luckily, I saw the temp gauge rising, got to the shoulder (fun at 4PM on a workday in 95-degree heat), and called the dealer. Since the work had just been done two days prior, they sent a tow truck and a service representative to drive me behind the tow truck back to the dealer. In truth, they ought to be glad I saved their butts. If I had kept driving, the car would\\'ve overheated and blown the head gasket, and they\\'d be the one covering the repair. Instead, they had a $80 towing bill to cover, and that was it.This was with about 173,000 miles on my 1996 Accord LX 4-cylinder.So, yes, I was towed once, but it was indirectly the car\\'s fault (I pay enough attention to my car to as to catch problems before they leave me stranded, such as seeing the radiator crack and the small leak that was getting larger).  This was with about 173,000 miles on my 1996 Accord LX 4-cylinder. Eh, you are over the 100k/10yr limit, I can\\'t even hold the car accountable for that. If thats the case, I get to add 2 more, another distributor (that failed the week we were closing on our house  ), and it blew out an o-ring on the counterbalance shaft, requiring an otherwise unnecessary timing belt/wp service and a tow. Then, they did it wrong, requiring another tow, and then then did it wrong again, but the leak was slow enough I could get back to the dealer.My dad was teasing me that the Honda had actually been towed more times than the Reliant, which seemed to break weekly when I was growing up.  That was its first time on a hook, DEFINITELY not its first repair though. Don\\'t get those mixed up. Repair one came at 135k or so.  One model with a huge quality problem can throw the whole thing off, like what happened to Ford a few years ago with the Powerstroke diesel that I believe cost them over a $1billion alone in warranty costs. Ford doesn\\'t mfr that engine though so I have to wonder how much of of the warranty costs go to the mfr of record.  Ford doesn\\'t mfr that engine though so I have to wonder how much of of the warranty costs go to the mfr of record. True, I know Ford is in a fight with Navistar about the warranty costs. So I believe Ford had to foot the bill and is trying to get reimbursed.  You are living in a dream world if you think vehicles have similar \"fairly equal\" quality across the board.I will join you on a sightseeing tour of car garages and shops if you will try something other than Nissans, Mazda\\'s, HOnda\\'s, and Toyotas (hint domestic car, not truck) for 100,000 miles and then say the same statement you are now saying.  What has your 2006 Civic (a first year model) been in the shop for repairs and replacements for? What parts and replacements? Just curious   One question: how many times have you called a tow truck in to move your Hondas? It is a myth that folks who drive anything but hondas or Toyotas are constantly getting towed and/or \"stranded\". That sort of thing just does not happen much with any car. I had a 1986 Horizon for 12 years and 120,000 miles never towed, never stranded. Same with a 1989 Plymouth Voyager also in 12 years 120K mi. 1997 Windstar that is still in the family, is at 10 years 110 K mi also never towed/stranded. A 1996 Contour was towed twice after I had given it away to my son. Once was due to broken timing belt at 106 K mi or so, this occured 3 blocks from home. This was not unexpected and was really more due to what could be considered to be deferring maintenance as long as possible. The second tow was when it was totaled in an accident at about 112K. After 1995 Contour was given to my daughter it had radiator explode with about 140K mi and she was stranded and towed.So in 20 years and about 450,000 total miles with American makes (the contours were bought used, so I am only counting the miles during the time we owned them) there is a total of one tow/stranding that was not due to accident or deferred maintenance.  Note to you... Edmunds must use averages to come out with it\\'s cost to own figures... averages over thousands of cars.If you buy the one that costs $100 more a year to repair, that might mean you get the one that costs $1,000 more a year to repair, since there will be many MANY more of those for company X (to obtain that higher average) than company Y (with the lower average).  Can we knock it off now? Seriously, this has been done and done and done to death. The SAME conversation was happening like, 2 months ago. Nobody won then, and no one will win now. And frankly, it\\'s boring and uninformative for anyone looking for a real conversation about the features, benefits, and drawbacks about midsize sedans.No more. Please.  You beat me to it by mere seconds!!Okay guys - you got two of us telling you enough of this. Please move on.  A 1996 Contour was towed twice after I had given it away to my son. Once was due to broken timing belt at 106 K mi or so, this occured 3 blocks from home. This was not unexpected and was really more due to what could be considered to be deferring maintenance as long as possible. The second tow was when it was totaled in an accident at about 112K.After 1995 Contour was given to my daughter it had radiator explode with about 140K mi and she was stranded and towed. My Contour V6 got hooked 2x, both times it was a waterpump. In my Japanese car, the rubber band in the engine would\\'ve been replaced by then and with it, the waterpump.My \\'89 Galant (car of the year at the time) was never on a hook in 185k miles.  Talking about the midsize vehicles, not their makes and warranty costs?Here are a few EASY topics...1.) 2 Different Accord 4-cylinder engines; how will the market respond, if at all?2.) Based on what we know, will Chevrolet\\'s new Malibu be a rental queen like the Impala, or a real-deal competitor, like the Fusion?3.) Your list of the top three MUST-HAVE features in your new midsize car, besides the obvious A/C, Stereo, PW/PL etc... and what model fits your needs best? Which ones needs work?How about these, host?  1.) 2 Different Accord 4-cylinder engines; how will the market respond, if at all? Like back in the day with the 90s models, EX had 140 while the DX/LX had 130, and then the EX got Vtec and the LX didn\\'t, etc. I am thinking no one cares.2.) Based on what we know, will Chevrolet\\'s new Malibu be a rental queen like the Impala, or a real-deal competitor, like the Fusion?I dunno, the vehicle is not marketed to me. It does seem like it has a lot of features though.Your list of the top three MUST-HAVE features in your new midsize car, besides the obvious A/C, Stereo, PW/PL etc... and what model fits your needs best? Which ones needs work?I can\\'t believe my \\'07 Accord lacks any kind of decent iPod interface. Criminy even Volvo can do it. I am also in the minority because I require a manual transmission. Oh, and ABS is required. Everything else I can think of is just a matter of how much you are willing to pay for a feature (although sunroofs and leather heated seats are very nice).  1) Just more choices.2) Since when has the Malibu been a real deal competitor; that should answer your question.3) Top 3 must-haves are 1. Reliability 2. Dependability 3. Durability.   1.) 2 Different Accord 4-cylinder engines; how will the market respond, if at all? It would make a difference to me. In 92 the EX had 140hp, and the LX had 125hp. I test drove the LX first, and was not going to buy an Accord, until I drove the EX. That 15hp made a big difference in that car.2.) Based on what we know, will Chevrolet\\'s new Malibu be a rental queen like the Impala, or a real-deal competitor, like the Fusion? It may be sold less to fleets, until low retail sales force them to re-think that decision.3.) Your list of the top three MUST-HAVE features in your new midsize car, besides the obvious A/C, Stereo, PW/PL etc... and what model fits your needs best? Which ones needs work? V6, Alloy wheels, ABS, 4 wheel Disk brakes, Auto climate control, and would it be possible to get leather seats without power or heat?  Nice post Grad!1.) 2 Different Accord 4-cylinder engines; how will the market respond, if at all?I think it will go completely over most buyers heads. They will buy for trim alone. I would think that if economy is your #1 priority, you should be impressed that Honda is trying to keep costs down in the entry level stuff. Personally I look at an Accord as the opportunity to drive luxury and not pay for it. EX-L is the only way to go! Finally I am most interested in what the diesel will be like.2.) Based on what we know, will Chevrolet\\'s new Malibu be a rental queen like the Impala, or a real-deal competitor, like the Fusion? I just don\\'t believe in Chevy\\'s commitment to passenger cars. It\\'ll read like a real contender and feel like a rental queen.3.) Your list of the top three MUST-HAVE features in your new midsize car, besides the obvious A/C, Stereo, PW/PL etc... and what model fits your needs best? Which ones needs work? Mp3 interface, manual without entry level trim, I would love cooled seats. It is way too hot for most of the year down in Texas. Cooled would beat the heck out of heated for me.  edit.  2) Since when has the Malibu been a real deal competitor; that should answer your question.Well, the new Malibu will be different from past Malibus, so no, it really doesn\\'t. I\\'m not the forum police, just trying to look for a constructive way to get off the shameless Honda is perfect praise. If a Malibu can beat a Camry in a comparison test (this is the current model that beat the last-gen Camry back in 2004), thaen I would say the Malibu has been competitive for a while now. The Camry is a best-seller, and a prominent magazine rated the Malibu higher, so, yeah, its competitive. I was asking about the new one with the 3.6L engine, much more stylish interior, etc... But instead it went back to bashing the domestic *sigh :sick: I tried.  I was asking about the new one with the 3.6L engine, much more stylish interior, etcI think the Malibu will do much better than the Aura has. It has Chevy loyal followers, It will have a 4cyl. engine available (it will, right?), and it will sell for less.  Yes, Malibu will have a 170 hp Ecotec and also a (mild) hybrid option--said to be the lowest-priced hybrid yet. And come next March, the I4 will have a 6-speed AT (comes out of the gate with just a 4 speed). And it\\'s (dare I say) a looker--IMO much better looking than Camry or Accord. I see a lot of Auras on the road, and Chevy has a much bigger dealer network, so if the Malibu is at least on a par with the Aura, sales should be brisk.  Your list of the top three MUST-HAVE features in your new midsize car, besides the obvious A/C, Stereo, PW/PL etc... and what model fits your needs best? Which ones needs work? 1. Safety - both active and passive. That would mean at least six airbags, active head restraints, good IIHS crash test scores, ABS, and ESC.2. Comfortable and flexible driving position. As Leslie Nielsen said in Police Squad (or one of its sequels maybe), \"A guy\\'s gotta be comfortable!\" That means a multi-adjustable seat with dual (or power) height adjuster, a telescopic wheel, and ideally an adjustable lumbar support.3. Smooth, compliant, quiet ride without being mushy. I drive on the pot-holed highways and byways of Minnesnowta most of the time. \\'Nuff said?I haven\\'t driven the new Accord yet (well, very few people have, right?), nor the new Malibu, nor even the Altima. Right now, there isn\\'t a single mid-sized car that meets all of these criteria. The Legacy comes closest, but is pricey, the ride is a little too firm for my taste, and it has too small a back seat for my needs (that would be #4 on the list). If the Optima gets a \"Good\" on the IIHS side crash test, it will move to the top of my list for mid-sized sedans. At least until I drive the Accord, Malibu, Altima, 2009 Mazda6... Another intriguing option for me, assuming it scores a \"Good\" on the IIHS side test, is the Elantra SE. It\\'s mid-sized where it counts (inside) but compact outside (and in price). But is well-equipped including standard ESC, has comfortable seating front and rear, and a smooth ride with decent handling. The Versa is another compact with mid-sized room, but it doesn\\'t offer ESC. Otherwise it\\'s high on my list; it\\'s one of the few low-priced cars (Civic is another) that aced the IIHS tests.  That 170 HP should supply adequate power for most situations.My \\'05 Sonata has 170 HP and 180 lb-ft of torque. I have never been in a situation where I felt a need for more HP or torque. Not for racing, but for pulling our of a side street or merging onto a limited access highway, my car has plenty of juice.  The interesting option to me is the hybrid, if it has more power than the standard I4, better fuel economy, and is still priced less than the Accord and Camry I4s.  And it\\'s (dare I say) a looker--IMO much better looking than Camry or Accord.Have you noticed that \"looks\" don\\'t get you very far in this segment. \"Substance\" sells here. If the Malibu sells well, it will be because the 4cyl version is competitive with the competition. Being \"on par\" with the Aura, is not what the Malibu needs to do, IMO. V6 cars (of any brand) do not sell very well in this segment. If Chevy wants to sell high numbers of Malibus it should not copy the Aura.  Well the Aura XR would have sold better had they not watered down the V6 image for the Aura in the first place with the XE 3.5 V6. This two flavors of engine and transmissions became a distraction for the Aura as seen as the really cool Euro - American car to compete with the likes of say the V6 Camry, Altima and Accord. But oh no, here we go with the old, we\\'ll give you six cylinders for the price of four cylinders, with an old four speed tranny. Then we also have this other version, which looks the same on the outside, but oh boy, she is a new gal inside, with the 3.6 V6 and a 6 speed paddle shiften\\' selector and that good stuff. Now they are going with an i4 engine in the Aura and a hybrid, with not all that much different performance to further confuse the buying public. NO- the Aura should have be top line only. Let the New Malibu to the rest. But then again, we have the first ever G6, Aura and Malibu, along with the pricey Saab, all sharing this platform. Ah it won\\'t stop there, perhaps a Caddy is on the way, or what the heck, a Buick or GMC truck (just kidding) in this platform. To me, the New Malibu is a slight exterior change to Aura, with a cooler looking interior, while the G6 is less interesting looking of the three sedans. Wouldn\\'t mind a Saab 9-3 for say $25K  And in the end, all will be good to good enough, but nothing to write home about. Yeah, I know, award winning and all that jazz. Good car, leave it at that. The Impala and Camaro are the next shots they need to take to score the big one. L  The Aura does look good, but I have to wonder what GW was thinking with that VW looking rear end on the new Malibu. Overall the new Malibu looks rather bland from the front, awful from the rear and just ok from a side angle. The Aura is certainly leagues better in the styling department. They should have stuck with the concept styling seen previously, the final incarnation is quite a disappointment.Interior of the Malibu, now that looks a lot better than its outer skin, and more stylish than the Aura.  Malibu Classic is not too far off from what the New Malibu is going to be style wise. What they needed in that first, not so bad looking effort, is now going to be available. Better handling and drive-train arrives on the scene. I hope the emergency brake is a hand brake type, and that the car eeks out another inch or two on the inside space -- more narrow center of dash, if not anything else. Hope it has gas props for the hood. Seems like it could be a decent car -- good car. Should play well against the competition in the mid-sized FWD car class. Now Toyota has the time to change the interior on the 2008, so one wonders if an improvement is in the works? What about the transmissions on the Camry? If they are A-OK for 2008, yet another problem for New Malibu efforts for the old knock-out punch. Will the new super-sized Accord be a hit. American seem to like super-sized everything. New look could be a hit too. With so many good cars in the competition, from Aura to Milans who knows the ultimate fate of yet another good car? Is the Altima going to remain fairly hot? What happened to Sonata? Looks like it is half fleet sales. Oh wait, this means soon there will be very-very inexpensive cars in this class flooding the market. Folks, this is one tough game!ya wonder?Loren  \"I can\\'t believe my \\'07 Accord lacks any kind of decent iPod interface.

It is basically a rebadged \"USASpec\" CD changer emulator thing. I would probably go aftermarket first. Like I said, I can\\'t believe the Accord lacks any kind of decent iPod interface. I also think the lack of RDS/stationID/songID info on that relatively large display is dumb too.  I am in total agreement. How difficult would it have been for Honda to add a MP3 interface ? Also info on the dispaly would have been nice. They should have done this with the minor 06 changes. The car would have sold better in my opinion. I just recently bought an EX I4 sedan 5sp because of the fantastic deals available. I had never seen such deals on an Accord.  I am in total agreement.

I figure I can drive it for a few years, then get something sportier and get most of my money back out.  Many people love their cars and don\\'t change brands. It can be seen in the opinions of many here. What percentage of car buyers when buying a new car switch brands ? And what were the former brands they are switching from ?

I do think that some problems with transmissions by the two have opened the door slightly.  I do think that some problems with transmissions by the two have opened the door slightly. Yep, you\\'re right about that. I bought a Ford first (02 Focus, 88k stress free miles) then Mazda (05 3s, 55k miles 4 front axles harsh vibrations, bad brakes...........)I would actually consider an Accord but I\\'m afraid of their trannys and won\\'t buy one. Toyotas are just plain boring. I want a bigger car this time and I thinking Fusion (3.5 pls) or Aura XR. I am def buying American again based on my past experience and the fact that our economy is falling badly. I\\'ll help. I can\\'t imagine (and don\\'t want to) what would happen if the now big 3 went out of business. It trickles down to ALL industries. What a mess.  Off topic due to size of vehicle but relevent due to the fact it IS a Honda. I originally had a small right rear suspension clunk (from new @ 5 miles showing) that only got worse until last July with about 4K miles showing it was terrible. Upon returning to the selling dealer and after a short test ride with a tech. it was evident to both of us (actually it was evident to me for a long time) I had some sort of problem. They took the car in, placed it on a lift, and five minutes later I was informed that not only was the right rear shock completely dry..all the fluid had leaked out BUT the left side was leaking too. So, both rear shocks were replaced at 4K miles. As I type there is a front driver seat, bottom cushion cover (the seat fabric) awaiting me to make an appointment to be replaced due to the roughly 4 inch X 3 inch patch where the fabric pattern has all but worn off. The fabric has not worn through but the \"squiggly lines\" that are the pattern on the EX sedan we own are mostly gone within that area. This is addition to several Honda \"service bulletins\" I have had to avail myself of to correct odd noises. There is one (#06-060)that they (Honda) won\\'t apply because the noise \"cannot be duplicated\" even though on the drive home from that attempt I heard it several times..bad for me!! Car currently has 10,050 miles showing. This was our first Honda product so you see I am not entirely in agreement with the notion from you or anyone else posting here that Honda is \"God\\'s own ride\"  Many people love their cars and don\\'t change brands.

I do think that some problems with transmissions by the two have opened the door slightly.The overwhelming majority of my vehicles have been hand-me downs. I really don\\'t consider myself to be a brand loyalist at all, I just look at what meets my needs at the time and what is available. I went from a Mitsubishi Galant (great car - they made its replacement much less appealing and no manual trans) to a Ford Contour (also a great car, no replacement from Ford) to a Subaru Legacy (so far a great car also, and a manual trans AWD wagon). The hand-me-downs were 90s Hondas, which incidentally, got replaced by another Honda.I wish I had been able to get a Subaru Impreza WRX or a MazdaSpeed6 (or even a Mazda6 Touring)instead of the Accord EX this last go around, but they were too expensive or unavailable.  1.) 2 Different Accord 4-cylinder engines; how will the market respond, if at all? I guess it depends on how different the performance really is. It appears that both should have enough power.2.) Based on what we know, will Chevrolet\\'s new Malibu be a rental queen like the Impala, or a real-deal competitor, like the Fusion?Although the back-end looks strange, the interior seems to be nice. Believe it or not, the Malibu competitive when it came out in the late \\'90s. Even my \\'02 Malibu was competitive in terms of price/standard features. I\\'m not a fan of the handling or styling in the current Malibus, but the steering in my \\'02 is excellent, the standard V6 is powerful enough, and the seats are great. Hopefully the new Malibu will improve on the original.3.) Your list of the top three MUST-HAVE features in your new midsize car, besides the obvious A/C, Stereo, PW/PL etc... and what model fits your needs best? Which ones needs work?When I bought my Malibu I wanted a V6, Cruise, and a CD player. When my girlfriend bought her \\'06 Altima we were looking for a powerful 4-cylinder, ABS, and side airbags (I can\\'t believe how many cars, including the Altima, still did not come with standard ABS). When I buy my next car, I will be looking for a powerful 4-cylinder, safety features (ABS and side airbags), and an MP3 player interface. Hopefully most cars will include these things in three or four years.  Many people love their cars and don\\'t change brands. It can be seen in the opinions of many here. What percentage of car buyers when buying a new car switch brands ? And what were the former brands they are switching from ? Does this have a place in the discussion when we are talking about how well a new car will do ? Can the domestics recover market share when Honda and Toyota are so well liked by their owners ? I do think that some problems with transmissions by the two have opened the door slightly. Sure, I think domestics can gain market share, but it is going to take a dedication to going above and beyond the standards set by Honda and Toyota. While not a domestic, Hyundai has offered an excellent warranty and more standard safety features at good prices. Although she didn\\'t end up buying one, those are the features that drew us to the Hyundai lot when my girlfriend was looking for a new car. I don\\'t think that having good looks alone will be enough to have a real impact.  Sure, I think domestics can gain market share, but it is going to take a dedication to going above and beyond the standards set by Honda and Toyota. While not a domestic, Hyundai has offered an excellent warranty and more standard safety features at good prices.If you think about the humble beginnings (Hyundai Excel, Toyta Toyopet, etc) of many companies, it seems like it takes a few years to establish yourself as a player in the marketplace, and then a few more to win buyer confidence. It will be interesting to see if those OEMs that lost buyer confidence can recapture it within a decade.  I used to be very brand loyal if I had a good experience with a product, but now, I\\'ve had good experiences with many different brands, so I don\\'t care as much as what characteristics a product has and it\\'s relative value. I do pay attention to what Consumer Reports and Jd Power says in their reliability ratings to get an idea of how things hold up. And both of these sources of info indicate that the differences in the amount of problems a car in this class have over a five year period is very minor (usually less than 1 extra problem over a 5 year period, which to me is not as significant as say hauling capability or better handling). Given that there are two different sources that have come up with similar reliability ratings, I find that I can now choose what I like rather than feeling any sense of loyalty to a brand. I mean, why should I be loyal to someone I give money to... I\\'ll let companies who innovate and engineer good features for a fair price get the money I earn. Who that company will be is up to them... let them fight for my dollars by constantly improving their product!  Since I\\'ve changed brands twelve times when buying/leasing cars, I guess I\\'d have to say I am brand agnostic.When I was young, I guess you could say I was a Toyota fan; 3 of the first 4 cars I bought myself were Toyotas. But then I learned there\\'s a big world out there with many good choices.  I wish I had been able to get a Subaru Impreza WRX or a MazdaSpeed6 (or even a Mazda6 Touring)instead of the Accord EX this last go around, but they were too expensive or unavailable. Hard to believe that you found a comparable Mazda6 or even Speed6 to be too expensive compared to an Accord :confuse: . Is this based on actual selling prices? From what I have read over the last couple years, the Speed6 was selling at $7-8K discounts from MSRP most of the time and Mazda6 probably available at anywhere from $4-6K off MSRP.Anyway since Accords do not depreciate, should be easy enough to correct your error  and trade that Accord for a 6 or speed6  .  Maybe it\\'s just a local thing, but I\\'m seeing many more Mazda6\\'s around lately compared to when I got my car almost a couple years ago. And there have been a couple different people posting on this forum mentioning that the Mazda6 that was configured the way they wanted was in short supply and would have to be ordered from the factory so maybe the upper trim models with a 5 speed are getting snatched up. If that\\'s the case, I\\'d think the deals that some were able to get may be harder to find.  I was asking about the new one with the 3.6L engine, much more stylish interior, etc... But instead it went back to bashing the domestic *sigh It wasn\\'t bashing at all, just reporting the facts on my previous experiences with the Malibu/Classic. Is it possible for a player that has averaged 5 homeruns a year for the past 10 years to suddenly have a year where they hit 45?? Sure (if they take steroids). But, not likely.  See, there\\'s the problem. There is nothing in this class that is a totally bad choice across the board for everyone. You need to let others express positive opinions about vehicles which don\\'t interest you without responding with sarcasm. The vehicle does not appeal to you? Okay, that\\'s fine - and neither does your vehicle appeal some others. That\\'s the way the cookie bounces and it\\'s no skin off your teeth... or something like that.It\\'s all about personal preference and it\\'s all good. The sarcasm and derision need to be left out of this because responses of that nature do nothing but derail the conversation. That would make this discussion much more helpful to shoppers which - I do believe - is the overall purpose of the Forums.  Understood, but I was just trying to reiterate in an entertaining way that people shouldn\\'t be so quick to assume a car can improve by \"lightyears\" all of a sudden, from one year to the next. Cars can improve, a lot, especially with major redesigns, but to assume all the sins of the past will be eradicated \"all of a sudden\" seems to me, wishful thinking.  That\\'s good - but let\\'s drop the sarcasm and the under-the-heel-grinding. Those kinds of things are what continually knock this discussion off track.I\\'m not just talking to you.  I enjoyed this forum. And, I want a similar high-energy discussion on cute-utes. I have already created a new forum.  A car CAN jump lightyears all of a sudden; check out Hyundai and most of its lineup. Check out Ford\\'s Fusion compared to the aged Taurus. Saturn Aura vs. Saturn L-Series sedan.I tend to believe its not wishful thinking; its what we should expect. If a company does not fulfill on its duties, shame on them. But damning a company for a what it was a decade ago isn\\'t quite fair in my opinion.And, I\\'m not sure if I\\'ve been a major part of the problem or not as far as getting this discussion derailed; I\\'ve been trying to keep things on track with new subjects, etc...If I\\'ve caused I problem, I apologize to the host, the posters, and the silent readers of this forum.  Saturn Aura represents a new direction for Saturn. It is in total a new car for Saturn, and the little plastic unique cars are replaced by GM basic design, or the Epsilon for everyone car. It is a good sound car. Why not just call it an Opel, who knows. The more interesting stuff come to us in a couple years as the Impala and Camaro. How good are the Aussie cars for reliability and performance -- anyone here know. It is basically the new stuff. The New CTS to me personally is a wait and see. I am not wanting any of these cars to grow, be a CTS or Accord, but that is life. We are all super-sized now from McD\\'s to autos.I personally see the Epsilon, in its many flavors as competing with the rest, and winning some hearts along the way. The Aura XR is entertaining to drive. I do not expect it change the game completly however, as it is doubtful to have the same resale value as brand X from Japan, and the reliability being equal or better is a question mark. Don\\'t know what to say other than I guess one could sort of judge reliablity performance by that of G6, as it has been released earlier and has some miles of actual use now. So when the new Consumer Report comes out, we have a couple or so years to go by. As for giant leaps, the RWD from Down Under still look to have the most impact. If they do not get the Impala and all those Pontiacs right, all hell may break in the press. I understand many are impressed with the Sky and Solstice. Well, they do look impressive.Wish more cars had good looks these day.hot-humid in california, blahhh, we aren\\'t use to this L  I am in total agreement. How difficult would it have been for Honda to add a MP3 interface ?Mazda needs to be slapped around for this also. Perhaps the 07 might have an interface, but I know my 05 doesn\\'t. I went aftermarket and got a tape deck emulator and now I\\'ve got two mp3 plug ins that sound really good (much better than those radio station ones). Since I did the install, it cost like $40, and took about an hour to do, so no big deal, but since Mazda\\'s are generally marketed to youthful people it is amazing that they haven\\'t added this feature earlier.  Nissan Altima And Saturn Aura: Canyon Road Cage MatchPretty interesting stuff that buyer\\'s would like to know. Considering how much emphasis Nissan put into improving their suspension, it\\'s strange that they did not put very good side bolsters on their seats.  A car CAN jump lightyears all of a suddenI agree. One thing honda and toyota did thats undisputable was to raise the bar. Everybody else was forced to catch up fast to stay competive. and because of honda and toyotas efforts, we all have better cars.  You haven\\'t. I appreciate your efforts to keep this conversation on track.   It all washes over time... a 2006 Fusion SEL V6 based on Edmunds TMV is $17,080 while a 2006 Accord EX (4-cylinder) is worth $20,027. In a few years, the Fusion will be worth next to nil while the Accord will still have some value when it comes time to trade-in/sell it. From a pure value standpoint at purchase time, I don\\'t think anyone can beat the Sonata.  Although these cars did not change overnight, they did change and for the better. I remember when Hondas were first brought to the US. They were really pieces of junk and you could see the rust bubbling under the paint after three or four years. The sheet metal was about as thin as a tuna can. I had a 1973 Toyota Corona which I kept for only one year as it was impossible to get the idle right. It had to be set so high to keep running with the air conditioner on that when you turned off the air conditioner it would be close to 2,000 rpms. Turn the air on and it would drop down to about 800 rpms. Several dealers could not fix so I got rid of it and took a beating. Now look at where Honda and Toyota are. Granted, it certainly wasn\\'t a quick turnaround but slow but sure. I personally think that the domestics can come around if enough effort is put forth and consumers keep open minds and don\\'t mindlessly follow the leaders.  Actually the best bet is the Accord SE V6 for price in / out.Sonata is a deal, if you keep it for ten years.L  In a few years, the Fusion will be worth next to nil while the Accord will still have some value when it comes time to trade-in/sell it.I think you exxagerate with the \"next to nil...\" comment. My guess would be that the difference in value is likely to be the same or less than the initial difference of $3000. When the Accord is worth $3000, the Fusion will likely still be worth more than $0.  No problem; I know I tend to get carried away sometimes, so I was just making sure!   Take a 3000 difference in initial price and add 6.5% sales tax which would total $3195 now compound at 6% interest over 5 years which would total $4275. When you add that number into the depreciation difference the Fusion would probably hold up rather well.  I\\'m picking this thread up after a couple of days absence, so it might have been addressed. I have an 05 Malibu Maxx with the 3.5 ohv engine. I think the technology was far from obsolete (obsolescent, maybe) and I like the engine a lot. Gets as good mileage as my 4 cylinder Optima-- 33 mpg on the road-- 22 around town, lighter and lower than an ohc engine, 7000 mile indicated oil changes on the OLM, unlike Japanese (and Korean) cars it\\'s real world mileage approached the old epa figures (most GM cars didn\\'t have the drops from 07-08 that Japanese cars did). True, it\\'s noisier and thrashier at higher rpms but low end torque is good and I don\\'t get that far up on the tach anyway.I think GM finally got tired of the tirades of the likes of Car and Driver constantly putting them down. RIP-- OHV engines, you will be missed. The last gen \\'Bu sedan was unremarkable, but I didn\\'t mind the back clip on the Maxx (won\\'t defend the front). I\\'m sure that the new Malibu is better in every way but I\\'ll miss the hatch and find the new one looks disconcertingly like a Mitsubishi Diamante from the rear.  I think GM finally got tired of the tirades of the likes of Car and Driver constantly putting them down. RIP-- OHV engines, you will be missed.I think the OHV engines are the ones GM is using for development of electronically actuated valves w/o a cam in the motor at all. That would pretty much be the ultimate VTEC.  I think engines are the same.Both have 11.7\" front ventilated disc and 11.5\" rear disc brakes.There\\'s only a 82 lbs difference.Very little difference in MPGs.Are these models twins or share the same platform?  What makes you think, or state here, that Japan and Korean cars do not match or exceed the EPA fuel figures? I have no problem doing so with a new V6 Accord. I have gotten up to 29 MPG and will likely do better once broken in. Let\\'s see a 200-300K mile engine, the break in must be at 50K  And I do not drive conservative to get the MPG, this is brisk off the line and good speed on the freeways. At 60 or 70, the SOHC is good to go faster with ease, and not throw a fit in doing so. Just smooth and sweet sounds coming under the full on acceleration period. And yes, the 3.5 OHV is perhaps the best V6 of its type I have seen. I am impressed with it in some ways. Good torque. Once up to speed, and in need of more speed, as in passing at higher speeds, I\\'ll still take the Honda engine. Or the DOHC 3.6 of GM, which is great. Something about the way the Hondas like to rev. Well, this is my first Honda car, but I owned a Honda 70SL and 100 bike some time ago. OK, a long time a go, gosh I feel so old.I could live with the 3.5 OHV engine in a car. I tested a G6 and did not like the electric assist steering. The engine was the 3.5 mated to a four speed. Test drove the Aura XE with that combo. It is OK. The XR is so much better though performance wise. For sound, I like the OHC engines in the V6, but I guess I never got a catback muffler by Borla on any of my OHV V6 engined cars from GM I owned. They all just made that blurping funny sound on launch time.L  I read today in the C/D 2008 preview that the Aura will come with an I4 for 2008. I think that\\'s good news, as not everyone who is looking for a mid-sized sedan wants/needs a V6 (I\\'m one of them). It should also drop the Aura below $20k and make it price-competitive (at least MSRP) with the Korean 4-bangers.Speaking of which, I noticed today that with current incentives and a discount down to invoice, a very well equipped Optima LX can be had for around $15k. So the new Accord looks really good... but is it $7000+ better than an Optima?  Well I bought an \\'07 Accord SE V6 for around $22.5K, some months ago. I assume it can be had for less right now. Have no idea what the Accord i4 then would be priced at, but let\\'s guess it to be currently around $19K for the SE i4, or less? Considering you are getting a Honda compared to a Kia and the resale should be about double that of the Kia in five to ten years time, I would say the bargain goes to the Honda. If you keep the Optima until death (of the car) or ten years time, the Kia is a pretty good deal indeed. That said, in ten years I could still sell a Honda for some good money.just trying to be helpful,L  Aura i4? I would wait an get the brother car, the New Malibu = better looking interior, and with some luck and bit more room inside. The Saturn Aura XR is a kicker drive of the bunch. If going base, plastic hub cap car, just go with Malibu or G6, IMHO.L  When I said \"the new Accord\", I meant the 2008 Accord. Good luck getting any incentives or even much of a discount on the new Accord for awhile. That means the base LX will start at, by published reports, about $21k. Add automatic, 17\" alloys, and upgraded interior trim (ala Optima LX with the appearance package and ESC package) and you are probably looking at $23k at least for an Accord I4 equipped like that. So I was probably being optimistic when I said a $7000 difference--probably will be more than that, at least for the next few months while all the \"gotta-have-a-2008-Accord\" buyers are satiated.Resale of an Accord double that of an Optima in 10 years\\' time? Maybe. As in, something like $2500 vs. $5000. You\\'d still be up several thousand bucks with the Optima. And I didn\\'t even include the extra taxes or interest charges on the Accord. No, the bargain clearly goes to the Optima. But if you gotta have that extra power, or spiffy interior (although the Optima\\'s interior is pretty darn nice too), or all the Hondaness (don\\'t know what else to call it), or extras like factory nav, and you don\\'t have a better way to use the extra bucks, go for it!  Don\\'t know about the Optima, but the Sonata, IMHO, is a good car, but not up there at the top. The steering, handling, suspension, engine, interior, and such are 85% to perhaps 90% there, but not quite the same as the top competitors. The car doesn\\'t handle and drive like a Honda V6. Anyway, just go get an \\'07 SE V6 for around $22K, or the i4 for much less money. I would say the i4 16\" wheels are more than large enough for the i4 engine version. Why would you want the 17\"? And the interior of the SE i4 is very nice. Then there is the Altima. I would wait for Camry until 2008 or 2009 to be sure bugs are not remaining. If looking at price only, the Korean cars do have price, with good performance, if perhaps not top line just yet. It all sorta equals out, and depends on what ya want from a car. The Aura XR is pretty cool, but the price is a bit much, if looking for the value overall type of thing, as in the price in/out. Just a sweet engine and tranny in the thing.Isn\\'t Optima the name of Radio Shack audio upper line products, after the Realistic name ( maybe it replaced it? )You could nickname the car Opie ! Or is that an Opel car?L  You never pay sticker on cars, be it Accord 2008 or Optima 2008.enjoy the drive,L  If they\\'re selling fast, you will, or within 500 of it  No, I would never pay sticker for a car, but for the short term you\\'ll pay much closer to sticker on a 2008 Accord than you will on an Optima. For one thing, forget about rebates or to-buyer incentives on the new Accord for awhile. And the steep discounts you\\'re seeing now on the close-\\'em-out old Accords? Forget those, too. It\\'s a new car, and ballgame, with the Accord now. As the guy from Men\\'s Wearhouse says, \"I guarantee it.\"   I had the same problem when I bought my altima. The dealers just weren\\'t having any problem moving them off the lot, and wouldn\\'t come down much. Some of the dealerships I sent emails to wouldn\\'t even respond. But, I knew it would be like that going in.  Have you researched the Optima? You might be surprised. The automotive press\\' consensus is that it\\'s a better car than the Sonata, at least in I4 trim. It has received strong reviews from MT (a 2007 COTY finalist), C/D (ranked just below the Accord and new Altima in the last mid-sizer comparo, with the comment that it out-Toyota\\'d the Camry; and CR has it (the I4) ranked above the Sonata (and the Camry LE, and Legacy, and Mazda6, and Fusion/Milan etc.) and one point behind the Accord. It handles better than the Sonata, has a nicer interior, has a 5AT vs. the 4AT on the Sonata I4s, and is shorter than the Sonata yet has almost as much interior room.So while the Optima is not seen as being the best of the class, it is viewed as being a very good mid-sized sedan and superior to some cars that are seen as standards in this class, e.g. the Camry. And of course it has the long Kia warranty. That makes it an intriguing buy for someone who doesn\\'t mind paying about $7000 or more less for a car that doesn\\'t have every attribute of an Accord or Altima, but is a solid, well-rounded mid-sized car.  I would say the i4 16\" wheels are more than large enough for the i4 engine version. Why would you want the 17\"? Wheel size diameter is an aesthetics issue, for the most part. The only time its not is when companies put random obscure tire sizes like 205/60R16 on their vehicles to crush any hopes of actually finding any kind of a performance tire. Most other vehicles use a 205/55R16 that can be found in types from mild to wild.  I agree a 16\" tire is fine for a family sedan. But with the Optima LX, Kia makes you buy a package that includes 17\" alloys in order to get ABS and ESC. :mad: That\\'s the one thing that really bugs me about the Optima. And the fact that the IIHS hasn\\'t done a side crash test on it yet.  Have you researched the Optima? You might be surprised. The automotive press\\' consensus is that it\\'s a better car than the Sonata, at least in I4 trim.I had an Optima for a rental car a few months ago, I found it adequate in every way while carrying 4 adults on in-town trips in Michigan. I also had a Sonata V6 that felt powerful, if a little bland, but totally adequate to run around Cincy.Neither vehicle made me want to run out and buy it right then (of course the Accord didn\\'t either, my folks did instead lol).  My wife has the four with add-on (but nice) leather, the appearance package--crippled dic, nice interior lighting, 17 inch Michelins-- for $16,100. Taking off the differences that should figure in at mid-fourteens for a base LS with automatic. We shopped the Fusion/Milan and Sonata four most carefully before buyingFriend just bought a Sonata, not sure what he paid as he had two cars to trade and he might not be as frugal as I am in driving a bargain. Just drove his car for a few blocks and it seems more comfortable. Frankly I\\'d prefer the Sonata (short drive) and last gen Malibu Maxx (my personal drive) when it comes to comfort. My wife doesn\\'t mind the Optima a bit for comfort but I\\'m roughly a foot taller. The Optima is only about a cubic foot smaller than the Sonata but it has more headroom. Who needs eight inches of above the head room if five inches is adequate. More important to get the leg room. The Optima\\'s platform is closer to the Elantra than a Sonata (struts v. links), but seems sportier in handling (not important to me)-- this is probably my 17 inch Michelins v. his 16 inch Michelin Energies (from experience Energies are lousy oem tires at least in my 01 Elantra). As far as the GM electric steering. It\\'s part of the reason why GM cars got good gas mileage. Vagueness and expensive repairs were negatives. I don\\'t mind the GM steering at all but can notice it after I drive the Optima. Same thing with the engine. Doesn\\'t bother me but the Optima\\'s four is smoother and revs better than the Malibu\\'s six (which does get as good mileage), so if I was doing short term comparisons it would bother me. I haven\\'t done a careful check but I think GM cars 08 EPA estimated mileages v. 07 has gone down less than the typical GM car. Now maybe somebody can do the research and prove me right or wrong on this.  the appearance package--crippled dic, nice interior lighting, 17 inch Michelins-- for $16,100.The appearance package has nice interior lighting, 17\" tires and WHAT?  DIC= driver information centerLOL Long night  No oil life monitor (shared with lots of cars), no MPG: huh?Sonata owners-- a quick drive of my friends Sonata indicated only one trip computer-- did I get that right? If so, that\\'s about as dim as missing the MPG readout. BTW-- Kia figures miles to empty so gas mileage is easily doable.  If you mean a trip computer vs a trip odometer, the trip computer does have the ability to show avg MPG.  I think you\\'re saying...That the Sonata has a trip computer that shows average MPG (the Optima doesn\\'t have this)-- the computer in most cars is usually optimistic though. That\\'s why I need two trip odometers. One for measuring trips, one to accurately measure mileage between fillups. Unless my quick look at the Sonata was in err, it looked to me like the Sonata only had one trip odometer. Correct?  Ya know it is pretty simple math to do in one\\'s own head. Once on empty, you have say three gallons left, and you get 30 MPG, it has to be up to 90 miles left. Not a bad thing though to have a little computer to let ya know from a half tank, how far you may be able to go. But then again, you become one with the car and just can do it in your head after a few months time. And the new cars can usually do some 360 to 450 miles on a tank anyway, so you should be close to a gas station at one point or another - just a thought.L  Why not get the \\'o7 then? If you do not need the larger 2008, just go for the 2007 and get the deal. You may avoid the first year out blues too. I hear of some 6-4-3 engine now for the V6. Sounds like possible trouble to me. And I do not need the car to be an inch taller, nor three inches longer, as it is pretty big already. And yes, the new one may be $500 to no more than $1,000 off, if it becomes popular. New car, ya never know.I think I have seen a couple of those Optimas around. I don\\'t think Kia is selling too many in my area, though other styles, like their SUV and minivans seem to sell here. Guess it is a good car. I did not research it, or take any test drives in one. You may want to test drive a V6 SE Accord some day on a twisty road. And it has very good passing speed and a good launch off the line. Interior is first class. That said, there is a lot of good mid-sized cars of all brands out there, and little if any are rated anywhere near poor these days. Seems you can not go too wrong. Close-out i4 Sonatas for $16K = wow, that is priced low :shades: With 27% going to fleet, resale may suck a bit.L  I live in the Midwest. Few twisty roads here. And as I mentioned a couple of posts ago, I don\\'t need the power of a V6. So I\\'m not willing to pay more for the Accord V6, whether it\\'s a 2007 or 2008. And to me the 2007 Accord is not that great a car, for what I\\'m looking for in a mid-sized car--and certainly not worth paying thousands more of my money than for a car like the Optima, Sonata, or Elantra. I\\'ll be keeping my next car in the family for at least 10 years, so I\\'m more concerned about up-front costs than resale value. Also, I\\'m not concerned about not seeing the same car that I drive on every street corner. In fact, I kind of like the fact that I don\\'t see my current drive, an Elantra GT 5-door, everywhere I look.   Do people in the mid-west drive Subaru\\'s? Seems like all wheel drive in snow country would be a good thing. Just a thought.L   Also, I\\'m not concerned about not seeing the same car that I drive on every street corner. In fact, I kind of like the fact that I don\\'t see my current drive, an Elantra GT 5-door, everywhere I look. All those Accords you see on every corner were bought for good reasons. Maybe there are a few good reasons why you don\\'t see so many Elantras.How many \"other people\" are driving a certain car should have no affect on what you buy, one way or the other, IMO. That\\'s allowing others to have influence on what you drive.  Do people in the mid-west drive Subaru\\'s? Seems like all wheel drive in snow country would be a good thing. Just a thought. People in the midwest originally from other places buy Subarus :P I don\\'t know, we got AWD and a wagon with a manual transmission for no price penalty and very slight fuel economy penalty over the Accord, which was our benchmark at the time.The Subaru feels much sportier to me than the Accord, but the Accord seems to have much more room in the back seat, even with the infant seat in the middle. Oh and the LATCH system works better in the Honda too. The Subaru handling is a lot more fun, it is phenomenal in the snow, and can tote 2700 lbs. I think once we get into child seats from infant seats, the differences will be less significant.  The Legacy is pretty good looking. Well compared to some rather odd looking stuff from Subaru over the years, the new Legacy is 100% improved. :shades: Nice looks, and all wheel drive sound like a good combo for snow country. Then there is the Fusion / Milan, which as posted here over and over again available in all wheel drive. I prefer the Milan look over the Fusion, but both are good ( well big butt, but good enough ) looking cars. Guess the new Mazda6 is coming soon? Seems like in the past they overpriced them, then had to discount them. Sort of an old GM thing to do. Oh no, here come the replies on that one. :blush: I would hope GM people all have a sense of humor. During ownership of those cars, it was the only thing which kept me from exploding from time to time, with every service shop en devour to remedy this n\\' that. So, I guess it is OK to rib them a little.L  How many \"other people\" are driving a certain car should have no affect on what you buyWhy not? nothing wrong with wanting to stand out, or be different.  So the fact that few people thought enough about your car, to buy it, is a positive thing? Buying a car because no one else wants it, just doesn\\'t seem logical to me.  you say few, but are probably taking about 10\\'s of thousands. It\\'s just nice to be different, stand out a little. I don\\'t think it should be the deciding factor, but its also nice to not have the same cookie cutter car that everybody else is driving. and probably because everybody else is driving. some people lead, some people follow.  I agree, going with the \"norm\" has always been a turnoff for me which is why I\\'m a bit against the Camcord. On the other hand I have to realize that this isn\\'t normal behavior by definition. The vast majority just go with one of the big two over and over again. This has resulted in the Accord being far less ahead of the curve than it was twenty years ago (Camry was always well done but conservative), but you can\\'t blame Honda for doing what\\'s in their financial interest.This doesn\\'t apply to the present generation Civic which is a big change and (could be argued) quite daring. Guess I am getting old because I for one don\\'t like that digital dash. I do like the Fit, however, so that shows that I\\'m not intrinsically anti-Honda. Too bad they\\'re so rare on the lots.  I think it gets down to wants and needs. When we bought the Subaru in \\'05, it wasn\\'t the run away sales leader by any means, and no one bought the Legacy wagon, they all bought the Outback.Personally, something with big heavy squishy tires and a raised center of gravity, and \"dual duty\" suspension was totally unappealing to me, so we went with the regular Legacy wagon. As an added benefit, we can actually find our car in the parking lot. At this time we were also cross shopping the Accord, but no wagon version, no AWD and proud pricing kept us away.When I lived in CA, I had the only Contour SE for miles around, but when I moved to MI, it started getting lost in parking lots too.  This doesn\\'t apply to the present generation Civic which is a big change and (could be argued) quite daring. Guess I am getting old because I for one don\\'t like that digital dash.Try it for a bit before deciding you don\\'t like it. It is very well set up for older drivers. It is a form of horizon display...the numbers appear at optical infinity, or on the \"horizon.\" This is great for older drivers (or anyone near-sighted that requires corrective lenses for distance) because it reduces/eliminates the time needed to go from looking at something far away to something close up and back again (its called accommodation). The Prius, the Inisght, and the Civic all have similar display technologies.  You know, I see very few NSXs or 300Zs or RX8s driving around, but I understand they are fine cars. Just because there are few cars of a certain model driving around, doesn\\'t mean no one wants them. Could be that only so many were available for sale in a given year, rather than 400,000 a year.And, some people like the fact that they\\'ll see a few dozen of the same kind of car they drive every time they go for a drive. That happened to me a lot when I owned a Grand Caravan--they\\'re all over the place. To each his own.One of the reasons this discussion is not as fun as it could be is that it\\'s nearly impossible to say something about why you like your car without having someone beat you over the head about it, and tell you how stupid you are for thinking that way. :sick:  Yes, Subarus are pretty popular in Minnesnowta, and if I lived outside the inner city I would be tempted to get an AWD vehicle (but probably not the Legacy, due to reasons I\\'ve noted earlier). But snow removal is an art form in the Twin Cities, and there\\'s been only one time in the past 20 years--the Halloween blizzard of 1991, 30\" of snow, when I really could have used an AWD vehicle.  So the fact that few people thought enough about your car, to buy it, is a positive thing? I don\\'t think that\\'s what people were expressing...I interpreted what they wrote as saying that there were several compelling reasons to buy car-x, and the fact that they were less common than camcords was a bonus. There were many reasons why I chose to buy a Mazda6 which among the bigger reasons were that the hatchback was more practical since it had a much bigger loading area than a trunk, great handling including its amazing brakes, had good reliability according to Consumer Reports and Jd Powers, and it was thousands less than what I could get an Accord for (another reason less popular can be a huge positive). But I did consider it a bonus that the Mazda6 was nowhere near as common. It\\'s nice when I walk out of a store and see my car as an attractive standout in the sea of vanilla-ish camcords and bloated SUV\\'s.  It\\'s nice when I walk out of a store and see my car as an attractive standout in the sea of vanilla-ish camcords and bloated SUV\\'s.My sentiments exactly, Zzzoom6. The only difference is we have a 2007 SEL AWD Fusion.  \"Don\\'t know about the Optima, but the Sonata, IMHO, is a good car, but not up there at the top. The steering, handling, suspension, engine, interior, and such are 85% to perhaps 90% there, but not quite the same as the top competitors.\"You\\'re correct & I agree with you that the Sonata is not up there yet although steering, handling, suspension, engine & interior issues may just be a matter of perspective but don\\'t forget that the 2007 SE Sonata is at least $5,000 cheaper than the $22k V6 Accord mentioned here.With that comparison, where the Sonata is about 85%-90% of the V6 Accord, I\\'d say paying for a Sonata, say the 2007 SE, at an objective price that\\'s about 70% of the V6 Accord is a pretty good deal to me :shades: Of course, people with moolah will certainly don\\'t mind to spend more for a car with a perceived higher quality.   It\\'s nice when I walk out of a store and see my car as an attractive standout in the sea of vanilla-ish camcords and bloated SUV\\'s. It\\'s also nice to walk up to my car in the parking lot knowing it\\'s what I consider to be the best midsize sedan in this segment. I\\'m certainly not going to buy a car I like less, because there are fewer of them around. :confuse:  nobody said anything about buying a car they liked less, just that having something different than the masses can be a factor in a purchase. Not everybody is like you and doesn\\'t automaticly go with the accord (not a critisizm, the accord is a fine choice). some people get torn between a couple different cars, and something like uniqueness can be a factor.a lot of people will rush out and get the new 08 accord for the same reason..........not many other on the road yet.  As was expressed well by someone else, the uniqueness factor really wasn\\'t part of my buying decision. But it is something I like about my current car. If I bought a car based on how unique it is, I guess my top choice in this class would be the Galant or Verona. :P  Test drove the Civic before my wife bought the Optima. More money for less car. Seemed noticeably smaller than my 01 Elantra.Wouldn\\'t completely dis the digital speedometer because what does a ten minute drive really tell you about living with the car. We still would have carefully considered a Fit but they only had one on the lot and wouldn\\'t let us drive it unless we looked very, very serious.   Fit but they only had one on the lot and wouldn\\'t let us drive it unless we looked very, very serious. For some reason honda is limiting the production on the fit. I can\\'t imagine why, It looks like a pretty good car.  My guess is, less profit margin than on Civics and Accords.  True, but it also helps them meet cafe standard because they\\'re allowed to average thier entire product line.  With the Civic having a higher EPA average than the Fit, and the Accord I4s with good numbers, I really don\\'t think they need the Fit\\'s numbers.There could also simply be a plant capacity problem with the Fit, since it\\'s sold around the world. The new U.S. plant will help there.But, back to mid-sized sedans...   Well it is higher quality. The Sonata is, like you say a cheaper car than is the Accord. No one is going to give away a car which identical to the top cars available at a fraction of the price. You know, the old if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. And take a look at what Intellichoice has to say on the different cars. Pay a little more up front, have the top line stuff, then trade-in or sell the car for a higher price -- which one is the bargain at that point? L  In this segment, cookie-cutter is the norm. Actually depending on where one lives car-x can be cookie cutter and be very high-end. in certain parts of the country Rolls-Royce are cookie-cutter cars, but I digress.I honestly don\\'t care how many of the brand of car I drive are on the road. Bro-in-law who does much more extensive research than me when buying a car, just ended up with a basic Accord. The reasons? They are the same reasons I would buy one over the competition. Not to mention Honda is giving away the \\'07s.  Intellichoice is very flawed. They ignore rebates in calculating costs, this overstates the costs of any car which commonly has a rebate available. They also ignore the value of discounted or free financing, when that is available. For example the Mazda6 has been available with $1750-$2000 rebates since Nov 2006. Intellichoice ignores this and shows a phoney ~$2000 difference in depreciation between Accord and Mazda6.I also found some flaws in their maintenance costs. For example on my car, Mazda6, their detailed maintenance costs mistakenly indicate that it does not have extended life coolant and does not have extended life trans fluid. They also project tire replacement cost at about $80 more than an Accord, I am pretty sure I can get the same tire price whether they are being put on an Accord or a Mazda6.Their insurance costs also have nothing to do with my reality. My insurance costs vary little, whatever model I choose and are far lower (about 1/3) than what they list. At most my insurance cost, from one model to another, might vary by maybe $200 or so over 5 years.I am not as familiar with the Sonata, but I bet the intellichoice figures are just as full of errors for that car.  I guess none of these errors apply to the Accord, right? People choose to believe what they want to believe.  it\\'s not about belief...it\\'s about noticing that intellichoice is flawed. you can assume that these flaws affect each car equally, but once the credibility of a method of calculating cost of ownership is shown to be incorrect for one car model on many different levels, the conclusions from this methodology are discredited. but if you want to believe in a descredited model, you can choose to do so... :confuse:  I think Edmunds TMV is flawed as well. They show a TMV of $18690 for a Mazda6i VE auto that you can buy in Chicago area for between 16500-17000 any time. I actually see people that think they got a great deal if they buy for 500 less than Edmunds TMV. You\\'d think they would be closer than they are. All they have to do is read the their own forums to get closer than they are.  So all these people who shop by comparing TMV and \"True cost to own\" are just going on flawed numbers. :surprise: If the numbers are flawed for one car, they are likely to be flawed for the other too. Does anyone do all these calculations before buying a car? Even if some other midsize car would cost me $50/month less to own (very unlikely), I doubt it would change my mind about which car to buy. Since I keep my cars more than 10 years, my True cost to own will be less than most, whatever car I choose.  I agree to a point. After reading a lot of the forums it does seem that a lot of people do look at some these calculators etc. as gospel. They should just be made award that the numbers may really not fit their region/locale. I just gave a 1993 LeSabre to Kars for Kids and I plan on keeping the car I just bought for at least 7-10 years so depreciation doesn\\'t matter so much to me either.  I guess none of these errors apply to the Accord, right? People choose to believe what they want to believe.No some of us choose to think for ourselves and do a little checking on numbers like those reported by (un)intellichoice.You tell me...when was the last time Accords were available with $2000 rebates, that were ignored by (un)intellichoice? Not to mention when was the last time you saw Accords advertised at $5000 below MSRP?The point is all the errors are in favor of Accord, at least when compared to the Mazda6. It is the Accord that is shown with lower maintenance costs, lower insurance costs, and lower depreciation all of which are questionable.If folks are going to throw this sort of garbage cost analysis on here, they should at least be willing to do a little work to defend the numbers, after the flaws have been pointed out again and again and again...that is assuming they actually believe the figures that intellichoice comes up with. Explain to me how I end up buying a Mazda6 at a few nundred above invoice, when there is a $1750 rebate? Explain to me how the 5 year maintenance cost of my Mazda6 is going to come to $1700, but the Accord is going to be around $1200? According to the maintenance schedule, all I will need to do is change oil, rotate tires, and do one replacement of an air filter and a cabin filter. Pretty sure that is going to come to maybe $600 total and then maybe another $600 if tires need replacing.  I plan on keeping the car I just bought for at least 7-10 years so depreciation doesn\\'t matter so much to me either. Even if you do keep your car for 10 years depreciation does make a difference. I got $5000 for my 12 year old Accord (92 EX). I doubt I could have got that for another brand.  You tell me...when was the last time Accords were available with $2000 rebates, that were ignored by (un)intellichoice? Not to mention when was the last time you saw Accords advertised at $5000 below MSRP? You can haggle plenty off the MSRP. There doesn\\'t have to be a rebate. The point is all the errors are in favor of Accord, Sure they are.   Your \\'92 Accord must have been in exceptional condition to get that much for it, correct? I\\'ll bet you could get at least $2000 for another brand, e.g. Mazda 626. But what if the 626 cost, say, $5000 less than the Accord (that is about today\\'s differential). Compounded over 12 years at 5% interest, that\\'s nearly $9000. Not including any extra sales taxes, which in some states would add several hundred bucks onto the original cost. So you really didn\\'t come out ahead financially with the Accord. But so what? If that were your goal, you probably wouldn\\'t have chosen the Accord to begin with, right? You enjoyed the Accord for those 12 years, and that was worth something to you.  Well in California there is a difference between a Mazda6 and Accord both new and used in trying to sell them. They have to deep discount to move the Mazda6 out. Used they sell for less. When buying, I took the \"Price everyone is paying as per Intellichoice\" to the Honda dealership and go that price on my SE V6 , plus they gave me what I wanted on the PT Crusier trade in. I can not recall the exact difference on the trade-in, but it was between the $1,200 to $1,500 range on trade-in price and discounts, as being higher to get the Aura XR which is an equal price wise to the SE V6 Accord. Saturn went lower on the car by, but had a low trade-in allowance. I did not price the Mazda6 to buy. Did see some on a lot for $5K off sticker which made them $22K. Overpriced, then discounted means nothing. They had too much dust on the hood. You can get the Accord back then for $22.5K and it has the good resale value. BTW, the New Miata is hot, if it was not for a too narrow seats in the car.L  That had to be one exceptional shape \\'92. I like Hondas and their reputation. It\\'s just that I liked the way the Mazda drove better and the features for price equation. Honestly, I realize I might have a couple more issues and maybe a few hundred dollars more in cost over the lifetime of the vehicle. But, I wanted a fairly inexpensive third vehicle and something fun to drive. I really like features I got with the Mazda for $16500 like all disc brakes, 17\" alloys, 6 disc changer, both front windows that down/up auto(a feature that I didn\\'t realize I would appreciate so much) and the overall looks of the car among other things. If it is worth $1000 10 years from I will be pleased as I will still be money ahead because of initial price and compounding the difference ala Backy\\'s comments.   I\\'ll bet you could get at least $2000 for another brand, e.g. Mazda 626.Considering Mazda\\'s average reliability, I think I would have had more problems with the 626, and probably wouldn\\'t have wanted to keep it for 12 years, Which would defeat the purpose of saving money up front. And I don\\'t believe a Mazda 6 equipped like the EX-L V6 Accord would be $5000 less. You make it sound like you can get $5000 off MSRP on a 6, but nothing off on an Accord, which is just not true. I got $3000 off MSRP in 03, which was the first year of the redesign. I\\'m sure I could do better on an 07 Accord right now.  A very close friend of mine has a 1994 Accord EX (white, sedan, grey cloth interior). It has been wrecked a couple of times, has 199k miles on it. Has an Alpine CD player (stock everything else), runs like a top, and everything seems in decent condition except for the driver\\'s window which is slow and squeals when rolling it up.He parked it on a fairly busy road and put a for-sale sign in it Thursday, asking $4,000. He had five calls as of Sunday.He\\'s not intending to sell it just yet, but he does want a bigger car soon and was testing the waters as to what he could expect to get for it. He said after that many calls he thought he\\'d ask $4,500 for it when he does sell in a few months.Not bad for a 13/14 year old car with 200k miles.  Last Mazda6 cars I looked at cost more or the same as the Accord, since the initial price was so jacked up. Seems like a really good car in some ways, and one can say they have the top rated car for handling within its class with the Mazda6, so it certainly is not a bad choice in many ways. The $1,500 to $2,000 off sticker is easy to do on Honda close out Accords right now. Plenty of dealerships, if at first ya don\\'t succeed. As for reliability, there is nothing certain in life. Lot\\'s of owners do seem very happy with Mazda, including durability, so who knows. All the cars are getting better these days. On the Mazda site they list the cars damaged in the sea accident and are not suppose to be sold as new. Does this imply they can be sold as slightly sea washed used??? Best to check that used car id number.L  The $1,500 to $2,000 off sticker is easy to do on Honda close out Accords right now. Plenty of dealerships, if at first ya don\\'t succeed.Seems like $1,000-$2,000 off of INVOICE is pretty common in Accords right now during closeout time.  So, he offers to sell @ $4K then what? I hope he accepts the $4K offer at that point and tells the buyer about the accidents. No one really offered near or at the $4K mark, I take it? It is amazing the resale value on Honda/Toyotas. They are the best in resale.L  Let\\'s not get carried away now. :blush:  No, he\\'s not prepared to sell it right now. He needed to know how much he could afford to spend on another car, so he was seeing if he really could get $4k for it. There are some cars in the paper here that are asking similar prices.I saw a 95 Accord LX, ~140k mi, asking $4,900 in The Birmingham News a few weeks ago.Whether or not they get it, I dunno. I hope they do, since I\\'ve got a 1996 LX with 175k!By the way, the accident will be pretty obvious on my friend\\'s car, since the airbag repair job on the steering wheel isn\\'t perfect looking.  Not bad for a 13/14 year old car with 200k miles. Exactly, saying depreciation doesn\\'t mean anything after 10 years is false. Accords hold their value for a long time, if you keep them in good condition. If you wash your car every week, and keep maintenance records, buyers are impressed by this and are willing to pay more.  Any car in good condition has value after 10+ years. The value is in line with the initial sales price--but it never goes to zero, for a car in good condition.It is often said that you don\\'t get something for nothing. So doesn\\'t it seem odd that an Accord buyer should expect to get the benefits often associated with an Accord, e.g. superior reliability, resale value, and driving experience, at no extra cost? Of course there is a cost. But you have to weigh it against the benefits received.  It must just be me, but I can\\'t imagine parting with 4-5 grand for a car with 200k miles and 14yrs old. Bassed on KBB, it sounds about right, but I wouldn\\'t pay that for any car that old and with that many miles.  It must just be me, but I can\\'t imagine parting with 4-5 grand for a car with 200k miles and 14yrs old. If you had seen my 12 year old Accord, including under the hood, I think you would say it was worth $5000. You could have changed the oil, and only got a little dust on your hands, because there was no grease or oil anywhere on it. I once took the seat covers completely off, washed them thoroughly, and put them back on. It was an easy car to maintain, so I enjoyed keeping it up.  It must just be me, but I can\\'t imagine parting with 4-5 grand for a car with 200k miles and 14yrs oldIt\\'s not just you. No way would I buy a car with that many miles. And that price tag adds insult to injury. A ticking time bomb of automotive aggravation in my book.Shoot for what.... $10,000? you can get an Accent with a great warranty and mega air bags. Duh.  I doubt it. 200k and 12 years is just to much for that kind of money. And for the sake of an agrument, I\\'m not disputing the value, just saying I wouldn\\'t buy it. I must confess though, the way honda vehicles hold their value is amazing. according to KBB, my \\'02 civic that I paid 14900 for with 115k miles on it is still worth almost 10k. But I\\'ll add, the big advantage people tend to forget about with resale value is insurance. I do get a degree of satisfaction knowing that if I wreck that high milage, aging civic, the insurance company will be writing a pretty good size chek. :surprise:  I have 175k miles on my 1996 Accord. Original transmission, alternator, even original brake shoes on the rears. This car has had oil changes every 3k miles, major maintenance done every 30k miles, and a timing belt at 88k miles (it\\'ll need one at 178k).I\\'d probably ask $4900 for it (just based on my friend getting calls for $4,000 on his 2 year older and 25k extra mileage car). I might get $4,000, maybe $4,500. Depends on the particular person seeing my ad.Would I buy this car if I were you? Heck no. I wouldn\\'t spend that kind of money when I didn\\'t know the person who had driven it for THAT long. It could\\'ve been run for 15k miles between oil changes; nearly overheated a few times, and have a problem eating tires. It could also be in great running condition, with most of its life on the highway getting nearly 30 MPG. At this age though, the question mark would be too big to plop down $5k though, for me.It does make me happy that there ARE people willing to buy these cars, though. I have one. I just wouldn\\'t be the person buying from me. Does that make sense?To be 12 years old this Nov. and have 175k miles, I think this car looks pretty dang good though (this is mine). That\\'s my UAB parking pass glimmering above the rear-view mirror. I took this picture this evening, after washing it.See more Car Pictures at CarSpace.comI put up a few pics on my carspace, from after getting hit/run off the road in June.  I\\'d say KBB is VERY optimistic.  Edmunds\\' TMV for a 2002 Civic EX 4-door (the most expensive Civic trim for 2002) with 115k miles in clean condition is only $7740. By that number, in about five years you\\'ve lost nearly 50% of the car\\'s value compared to what you paid for it. Which is pretty good! In comparision, I had a similar experience with my \\'01 Elantra, which I sold last year after 5-1/2 years of ownership, for $5900--exactly 50% of its original purchase price. So you and I both lost about 50% of our original investment over about five years (assuming Edmunds\\' TMV figures are closer to the real world, which I have found over time they usually are--for example, their TMV for my Elantra at the time I sold it was $5950.). However, my loss was $5900, and yours (on paper) is over $7000. I point this out only as a caution, that resale value percentages don\\'t tell the whole story.An example closer to this discussion (although my Elantra was classed as a mid-sized car based on interior room): this goes back to the 12-year old Accord (a \\'92) that was sold for $5000. Here\\'s a comparison of 12-year old mid-sized cars, a 1995 Accord EX-V6 and a Mazda 626 ES-V6, each with low miles (120,000) and in outstanding condition; for private party sale, according to Edmunds\\' TMVs:Accord: $3783626: $1675Note that this is for a V6 Accord (not available in \\'92), and it\\'s three years after the \\'92, so some price appreciation should have occured. If this is a representative average for sales prices (with some people doing better and some not as well), then the Mazda buyer would need to have paid at least $1200 less up front than the Accord buyer to come out ahead financially on the purchase in 12 years, assuming an interest rate of 5% compounded annually.The purpose of this rather lengthy example is to demonstrate that it doesn\\'t take a huge difference in price to make up the resale value between an Accord and other makes over a long period of time. And consider now that the price difference between an Accord, even the leftover 2007 models, is several thousand dollars compared to cars like the Fusion/Milan, Mazda6, Optima, and Sonata.Thus, if you plan to own your mid-sized car for a long time and think you can save money in the long run due to a car\\'s historically high resale value, it might be something to re-consider.  Will have standard ABS.I\\'d say its about time!   Sometimes KBB is not optimistic at all. My 92 EX Accord, sold 12 years later (137k miles), had a KBB value of $3,850. I guess the guy who bought it didn\\'t look it up in KBB, because he had no problem giving me $5,000 for it.  Kelly is asking price, Edmunds (which is pretty close to NADA in my experience, though it\\'s been several years) is selling price. The only thing I\\'ve ever used Kelly for was to make window stickers when selling a car.That Honda looks in better shape, but the last old Japanese car I bought was a 90 Camry with about 140,000 on the clock in about 2000. Bought it for my daughter and it\\'s still in family use, although I put way too much repair money in it between transferring it from one daughter to another. Anyway they\\'ve abused the hell out of it but it\\'s still chugging away at 200,000 miles plus. If memory serves me right I paid slightly over a thousand for it from some guy who used to fix \\'em up and sell them from his house (until the subdivision put an end to that scheme). Again, it was relatively clean but nothing like the Honda.  I did a quick Auto Trader check on \\'92 Accords. Range from $500-7695 with average price of $2974. Of course that includes all sorts of rip-off used car dealers.  I have a sensitive back. MY 97 camry is still a good seat. Car shopping and found the new camry and lexus ES is HORRIBLE for my back. I do have sensitive back and back problem that needs support.Don\\'t like the dashboard reflection on the acura.Who makes a great seat like they use to in a sedan? HELP?  Yes, I think you got very lucky in terms of who bought your Accord. That\\'s why there\\'s a thing called \"average\" sales prices.   I\\'ve found VW\\'s seats to be excellent for support, also those in the Accord are good. Volvos are also supposed to have good seats, although on the firm side--seems like you need a firm seat though.One of the most comfortable driver\\'s seats I\\'ve ever sat in is the one in the 2001-2006 Elantra. It is an 8-way adjustable (manual) seat, quite rare these days, especially on an inexpensive car. It includes a lumbar adjustment, and it\\'s quite firm (especially on the GT, with leather). If you don\\'t mind buying a used car, you might check it out.  Sounds to me like you found a real fish. No matter how good that car is, major maintenance items are bound to pop up on this $5000 12 year old car.  Although I have been lurking in this forum for quite a while and frankly have read posts that have gotten me livid, I had to respond this time. It should be noted that information concerning Mazda\\'s putative \\'average\\' reliability, which unfortunately is bandied about here and elsewhere, is sheer conjecture at best or frequently garnered via debatable methodology. For every \\'survey\\' which claims that Honda and Toyota produce vehicles that are intrinsically more \\'reliable\\', there are others that report diametrically-opposite findings. Despite the fact that I have seen (in action) an Accord with an utterly-flawed automatic transmission (and I know that this particular problem is pervasive but obviously not universal across the line) and read about Toyota\\'s \\'sludge\\' problem, among other issues, many still choose to reify the products of these two companies with scant problematization. More troubling is the implicit assumption that if you do not purchase the Accord or Camry, and I am not accusing anyone here of this \\'crime\\', you are bereft of common sense and intelligence, and somehow are \\'stuck\\' with a car that is devoid of the exaggerated (in my humble opinion, at least) \\'merits\\' of a Camry or an Accord.Regarding the much-maligned 626, we have got one in my family that is 7+ years old and is still running beautifully, thank you very much. For the record, I really have got my own idiosyncratic qualms regarding the Accord and Camry. As such, I personally will NOT buy either one and this most certainly is my prerogative; people can choose to procure whatever they wish and do not require the validation of others.  Who are you trying to impress? Not even Bill Buckley writes like that. You certainly wouldn\\'t/don\\'t talk like that...be honest.P.S. You should try using spell check.  The last time that I checked, writing AND speaking well are not something to be ashamed of, or are they? Moreover, this is a forum regarding cars and not a \\'free-for-all\\' critique of my writing style. You can skip my post the next time, ok?THANKS!  I respect your opinion. And yes, you certainly can buy any car you desire.  Apparently you disdain \"surveys\". How about consumer reports ? Last I heard it was well respected when it came to cars. Why do Honda and Toyota do so well there ? Any brand of car can have problems and you here more abouth these than anything else. But when you sell more cars and you come out at the top this should mean something. I certainly understand not buying a car after you\\'ve had problems with the brand. In the same vein, yes Mazdas have less reliability than Hondas. See consumer reports. Their parts also usually cost more. How many Mazdas do you see in a dealer lot with 5 yr/150K on them ? I\\'ve been surprised to see some Hondas with same while looking recently.  Seems like $1,000-$2,000 off of INVOICE is pretty common in Accords right now during closeout time. Meanwhile $3000-4000 off invoice on the Mazda6 has been pretty common for many months. Despite this intellichoice shows both of them with target price of a few hundred above invoice. This equates to maybe a $1000 error for the Accord, but about a $3000 error for the Mazda6.This would mean the depreciation cost difference between the Mazda6 and the Accord is overstated by about $2000.  How many Mazdas do you see in a dealer lot with 5 yr/150K on them ? I\\'ve been surprised to see some Hondas with same while looking recently. Well, since Honda sells many times the number of cars that Mazda does, of course you are going to see a greater number of them. I\\'m sure, if I looked, I\\'d see many more Hondas than Mazdas in the junkyard too.  How about consumer reports ? Last I heard it was well respected when it came to cars.I fear that you may have mis-heard.re: Mazda Their parts also usually cost more.Actually given Ford\\'s global platform structure, their parts are actually less expensive, especially with respect to Toyota.  Well, have you seen any Mazda with 150K on any dealer lot. I doubt it.   Ford\\'s global platform structure may be irrelevant. I\\'ve had many independent service techs tell me Mazda parts are more expensive and harder to get.  All,Concerning the \"average\" reliability of the Mazda 626...I think these ratings for all cars should be broken down by engine/transmission options, as in most cases the really major problems are limited to just one of these.Case in point: The different engine/transmission combinations available on 1998-2002 626\\'s made some of these cars well below average and some well above average in terms of reliability; unfortunately, all that is ever reported is the overall \"average\" for all 626\\'s. The Mazda 2.0L I4 matched with the Ford-sourced automatic transmission was plagued with problems. The transmissions required frequent re-builds/replacement, as often as every 30k. On the other hand, the Ford-sourced (Mazda re-worked) 2.5L V6 paired with the Mazda 5-speed manual was an exceptionally reliable (and entertaining) combination. I know, I had one with over 100k. (Note: that V6 5-speed Mazda with 100k sold for over KBB)  On my 1998 Mazda 626, my mechanic pointed out to me that many of the electronic parts were interchangeable with Ford. This was evidenced by two distinctly different cable connection types present under the hood (one style for the Mazda parts and one style for the Ford parts).Shoot, I even remember one part having the red three-point Mitsubishi logo...  Why do folks here have to defend their Camcord purchases? Can\\'t they just like them better than the others? Not everybody calculates the minute financial ramifications involved with every purchase. Personally I don\\'t care for half the vehicles in this comparo, so no matter what their attributes are that you would use to persuade me to buy one, I just wouldn\\'t buy one. Period.I spent the day in an indoor Ford dealership yesterday, hanging with a friend buying an F150, and I wouldn\\'t have given you half of what the stickers on those vehicles asked. Ford plasticland. I\\'ll stick with Hondas.  The idea that because a car is discounted when it\\'s new would make a used, high mileage car hard to sell isn\\'t necessarily true. My old subaru I sold last year after buying the Mazda6 was a 94 legacy gt with 150k miles on it. There were a few dings on the outside, and a couple probs with the cloth in the interior. After buying the 6, I put an ad in Craigslist for $5k (a little less than KBB\\'s private party value) and sold it that day for cash! I think I got a bit lucky at how quickly it sold, but the point is that there are other cars that hold their value and sell well besides just accords. And at the time I sold my Legacy, those were going for 5K off of MSRP for new ones (at least the ones that were left - I bought mine in late november when the next year\\'s models were on the lot). Anyways, sometimes when cars less commonly sold that have pretty steep discounts can hold their value suprisingly well.  Ford\\'s global platform structure may be irrelevant. I\\'ve had many independent service techs tell me Mazda parts are more expensive and harder to get.It would seem that mazda\\'s parts do cost less. In the last IIHS fender bender test, the mazda was one of the least expensive to repair.  but the point is that there are other cars that hold their value and sell well besides just accords.My point wasn\\'t to say that it was just Accords. It just happened to be that my friend has an Accord to sell, and i have two of them. I don\\'t have experience with selling back another brand of vehicle, so I wouldn\\'t dare say otherwise. All I am doing is speaking about what i know, and that is the good resale of Accords; not poor resale of others. I can\\'t make a solid statement about something I\\'ve never experienced firsthand, now can I? My original post about my friend\\'s Accord got a lot of heat. I wasn\\'t trying to impart one car\\'s superiority; just that the Accord does have good resale. It wasn\\'t a comparison, a put-down to others. Folks, we shouldn\\'t have to be so dang defensive around here. Not with me, anyways. (this isn\\'t directed at you specifically zzzoom6).Some long-time posters I sort-of \"converse\" with (elroy5, tallman, backy, among countless others) will tell you I\\'m typically pretty straightforward when I bring information to the table. It\\'s not an attack. If I bring an opinion other than my own, I do my best to cite my info. Not a bad idea for others to try, true?Anyway, I\\'m off my little soapbox for the morning. I\\'ll check in later!Best,Thegrad  If you\\'re talking about the bumper test. Kudos to the Mazda 6 for less damage. But nowhere can I find where it says that Mazda parts cost less. Just that there was less damage.  It is also possible, but not probable that you may be struck by lightening. One must first look to the probable scenario.L  sorry grad, my comment wasn\\'t suggesting that you said that other cars couldn\\'t have good resale value.... others kind of implied this (saying that the used accord would sell for 5k, but brand \\'x\\' would sell for 3k...), but your comment was the one I clicked \"respond\" to.  ????  It\\'s not a problem - I was directng my frustration at you, either.Yours was just the last post on the topic I wanted to speak on.   I think he means that he think you got lucky with the Legacy; thats how I took it anyway.  Well, have you seen any Mazda with 150K on any dealer lot. I doubt it. This sort of comment is just silly.I\\'ve never really been interested in 150K mi + cars. But a quick 50 mile search on cars.com turned up 2 mazdas for sale at new car dealers that meet your 150K mi criterion...both over 200,000 miles, actually.For Honda, the same search turned up 2 at new car dealers with over 200K and 8 between 150 and 200K. I\\'ll make a wild guess that Honda probably outsells Mazda by about this same 5:1 ratio???  or is he saying that selling a legacy for as much as an accord is as likely as getting struck by lightning? Or maybe he\\'s saying that selling my car quickly was improbable. or maybe he was saying that my mazda6 will not sell for as much as an accord in 10 years... only he knows what his cryptic (and supposedly sly) comment means exactly. Actually, in our neck of the woods, subaru sells quite well and has a good reputation. In fact after doing more research after selling it (I know, doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to research after I sold it but just wanted to know if I did ok or not), asking price at stealerships was higher for models w/ a smaller engine than what I sold. And the people who bought mine said that mine was in much better condition than what they found elsewhere. Retail price on KBB was around 6k while private party was about 5.4k. I think trade in value was in the high 4k range. So all in all, I probably could have gotten more, but it was nice to be able to sell it so quickly and not have an extra car clogging up the garage.Funny thing was, when I got my Mazda6, I wanted to trade in my Subie and was willing to take anything more than 4k, but they wanted nothing to do with it. Just as well, as it turned out.  But as you and I know, mazda\\'s are more fun to drive so maybe the owners are keeping them longer :shades: More seriously though, this is not the $3000 or less used car clunker forum... I doubt anyone here has been going to car lots looking to trade in their newer midsize sedan looking for cars w/ over 150k miles on them! And I think your 5:1 ratio is generous to Mazda... cars w/ 150k miles on them would on average be around 10 years old, and Mazda was almost bankrupt then b/c of very low sales. I\\'d geuss the ratio would be more like 10:1...  Your experience with the Legacy selling for a good sum is like going the carnival and tossing a coin to win the fanciest of the glasswares. It can happen. This is both good and bad. Some people then feel good fortune is easily had and bet the farm. Hundreds in dollars in coins later, you realize the coin landing on the glass in the carnival was but a fluke.That said, yes I would say you buy what you like, and if it is discounted it is all the better. AND, I may add in some cases a car becomes just as good or better than the next due to hotter selling car if it has some function required. Cars like station wagons sell well later on, as they get the job done, even with dents and the most popular look is not so important in a car, when a family of four is the working poor. Trucks when new, could differer more due to some fad in style or advertising push, then later on equal out more in sales. And it is so true, you need not get as much as brand X, when you paid so much less for brand Y. As a side note, they have closed down the GM is on the offensive - will it work, forum.  Spin offs now include the GM is offensive forum........ :surprise: OK, just kidding.Loren  Moses is likely driving a Miata. Those things are unstoppable. Take the DNA out of that and put it in every Mazda and they would run to eternity. Almost as long as Clintons in politics. We are talking a long, long time here. L  link titleand I didn\\'t take time to figure in the options   I just received my October edition of Motor Trend, in which they compare the new Accord with the new Camry. In the side by side picture of the two cars, I think the Camry is much more attractive and aggresive looking. The writer suggests the new Accord reflects hints of a BMW 3 and 5 series......I disagree. I think the rear end is ugly (almost like a subaru legacy or a saturn) and the side view looked ugly too. I almost waited to purchase an 08 Accord based on the concept designs I saw, but am glad I purchased a Camry instead. I am a little disapppointed with the \"new\" look of the Accord. I think its ugly.....although some think the Camry is ugly. Just my two cents.  Actually, Kind of funny thing with perfect timing happened today. My wife took the civic in for an oil change. They discovered the CV joint was bad and needed replaced. Only $300 to fix, but $300 more than I\\'ve spent on my 200sx that is 4 years older and has 30k more miles on it.I used the oportunity to once again remind her that she should have listend to me and picked another nissan instead of going with that honda junk :P Just a joke of course, I\\'ve been as satisfied with my honda products every bit as much as my nissan products.  Man, this brand bashing is getting boring. I don\\'t think there is any vehicle in this discussion group that varies greatly from any other in reliability and by definition they are close to the same dimensions. So it comes down to price, safety, styling, ride, handling and features. Styling is pretty subjective unless something is just butt ugly(IMO doesn\\'t apply to this group)and ride and handling is personal preference versus something good or bad. Safety is pretty close across the board except for Altima making ABS an option (rectified in \\'08 I hear). Features are quantifiable, but again are a personal preference but personally the more features for the money is something I appreciate. Price is a matter of negotiation and market conditions but there is generally two tiers in this class. The Honda, Camry and Subaru brands tend to be about 3-4000 more per comparatively equipped model than the other brands and they are worth about 2-3000 more a few years later so even price is somewhat of a wash. The main difference being the enjoyment more or less the owners experienced during that time.Bottom line: Most of the items that people are bashing each other about are really personal preferences so I like to view comments as if they ARE personal preferences rather than assume someone is trying to exert there wants/needs on all others.I personally would like to hear more about what the different brands offer and why you feel that way. Thanks.  I agree that price and total cost is somewhat of a wash in the end. However, when posts refer to intellichoice, I point out the flaws because they claim the Accord is significantly cheaper to own than a Mazda6, for example. I don\\'t think that claim should be left to stand, as if it were a fact.  Well, first of all, Civics don\\'t have too many options. Second, you didn\\'t mention before that you were talking about the dealer\\'s retail asking price, not trade-in value or (the number I was quoting) private party sale price. Sure, a Honda dealer will try to sell a 6-year-old Civic with 115k miles for over $9000. Will they get their asking price? Probably not. But maybe they will. Perhaps the guy who bought elroy5\\'s Accord will need another car. One thing is for sure: you won\\'t get that retail price if you try to trade in your Civic or sell it to a private party. So your depreciation needs to be calculated based on what you can get for the car, not what some dealer can try to get for it with their markup added.  Why is it not a fact? Mazda6 resale values suddenly rise overnight? The asking price is way high, then they discount down to around the same price as a discounted Accord. Consider the resale of an Accord is significantly better, the Intellichoice seems to be an Accord. If a person prefers the Mazda6 of course, you would not wish to buy the Accord simply due to total cost to own.L  A Camry is not ugly, but does have the trendy too tall doors look, with flat sides. The rear Chris Bangle Modified X Toyota look is good, but the front nose is nothing short of odd. If you run down to Honda today, they have the \\'07\\'s left. The New Malibu will be decent looking. And the Altima looks good, but alas some things I simply do not care for inside, and that CVT. If buying a stick, then it is a maybe. Hate foot emergency brakes, and the Altima is placed really in an odd position. New Mazda6 is on the way. The Aura XR is kinda cool, but look for discounts and watch out for trade-in values. Have not seen the 2008 Accord yet. I would imagine it to have the too tall doors. Note the 1\" tall and 3\" wider size, it is getting a bit large I think for an Accord. Sort of more the Avalon these days. L  Bottom line: Most of the items that people are bashing each other about are really personal preferences so I like to view comments as if they ARE personal preferences rather than assume someone is trying to exert there wants/needs on all others. Many of us (yes, I am including myself) have fallen victim to retaliating against another person\\'s view. When someone implies that your car is overrated, inferior, overpriced, or an underachiever in this segment, we get offended and feel the need to defend our car buying decision. When really it doesn\\'t matter what someone else thinks about your car. If you are satisfied with your car, that\\'s all that counts. I am slowly coming to the realization that everyone does not think exactly like I do. :surprise: And that\\'s ok, I guess.   Why is it not a fact? Mazda6 resale values suddenly rise overnight? The asking price is way high, then they discount down to around the same price as a discounted Accord.Some have mentioned that a discounted v-6 accord could be had for around 23k. I wanted a manual tranny which is only available on the high end accord, so add 1-2 thousand to that price. I got a manual v-6 hatchback with a bose stereo and sunroof for 19.5k with $300 in accessories and 3 oil changes thrown in. So I don\\'t know where you come to the conclusion that a Mazda6 sells for the same amount as an Accord... And when I looked on KBB a couple months ago, the retail value of my car was about the same as what I paid for the car 18 months prior and the private party value was less than 1500 less than what I paid. Not bad resale value for me... of course if you\\'re basing your statement to msrp then you\\'d be right in saying that the 6 does not hold it\\'s value well. But based on what many others have been able to buy their 6\\'s for, it\\'s been a good value.  Just going by what I viewed on the car lot. They were all around $26K to $27K with $5K off. Now those may all have been auto. I was not shopping for a stick. Yes, you got a good price. I have owned several hatchbacks. While they are good for moving stuff, they have the drawbacks as well. Kinda one of those things, it is all in what you value most. In the Mazda6 it appears that the hatch is the best looking model.L  Someone posted a photo of the new CTS 2008 they bought. Wow, had no idea they are out yet. At the angle of this photo something looked odd to me. My goodness, it looked like a Ford Fusion on steroids. Will have to run on down tomorrow to see if they have any in California yet. I am hoping for something better looking than the photos, as in judging by the pics, I like the original. Why must all these cars grow in size, every model change? Was the simple, edgy front replaced with something all too busy, or does it fit the looks or dazzle one in person???Looks wise, how many here prefer the Milan to the Fusion? Or are they too close to call. And does the front really remind you of a razor -- hey is that Gillette Fusion razor? In a way, I like that front, as much as I prefer the Milan tail lights.L  Every time my 12 yr old daughter sees a CTS coming towards us on the road she says \"Is that a Fusion?\" so you\\'re not the only one.I preferred the Fusion styling over the Milan but I would have gladly taken the Milan tail lights.  Hard to know what you were looking at on the Mazda lot or what version of Accord they are comparable to. Was the final price $26-27K or was it $5K below those figures?What I know is that I and many others have bought Mazda6 4 cyl, ATX, sport value sedan for about $16,000. This version is comparable to the Accord SE, which all indications are sells for thousands more.What I also know is that anyone with any sense at all will not be paying several hundred dollars above invoice, as intellichoice claims, for a Mazda6 after the rebates of about $2000. So this overstates the mazda6 depreciation by about $2000. Now if someone can show me a $2000 rebate on an Accord, I\\'ll accept that there is an equivalent error in the intellichoice depreciation figure for that model.  07 Accord EX 4cyl/5spd manual 70%/30% highway/city very first full tank 29.x mpg, second tank 31.8 mpg93 Accord EX 4cyl/5spd manual 70%/30% first non-winter gas full tank 31.6 mpg, last tank 31.3.05 Subaru Legacy Wagon 4cyl/5spd manual 40/60 highway/city last tank 29.1 mpg (trip computer said 31)Gas went up to $3.25 around here yesterday!!! I felt bad for the guy next to me in the TrailBlazer.  I agree. I didn\\'t mean that I don\\'t like people to disagree, that\\'s what makes this site so enjoyable if you like cars, especially in regards to debatable or downright erroneous info put forth by supposed \"in the know\" web sites. I am a Mazda6 driver myself so I totally hear where you are coming from.  I had the chance to drive a new Camry SE for a week while my Tundra was getting a new auto tranny put in at 43,000. Yeah, even Toyotas break sometimes. Thank god it was under powertrrain warranty. I liked the SE but thought it handled a little rocky even with the SE suspension and thought some of the silver plastic inside looked a little cheap. Ran good, nice shift points as it took off well but settled down to around 2k rpms at 70mph which I was impressed with. My Mazda6 I4 runs at about 2500rpms at that speed. Anyway, the thing I really disliked about the car was the view (or lack thereof) out the rear window while backing up. I\\'m about 5\\'9\" and between the headrests and the height of the back shelf I felt like I was backing up my pick-up. I guess it\\'s partly the BMW type rear end and the height of the beltline that bothers me as I noticed that my arm was kind of at an odd angle(up) when I drove with my arm out the window which I like to do. It wasn\\'t real comfortable in that respect. I did like the lighting on the dash though I wonder if I would get tired of it long term.  agreed, this is the first time I can say the camry looks better than the Accord. Not a good thing for Honda since they are supposed to appeal to a younger crowd than Toyota. Looks like Honda is getting too conservative for their own good. Of course most reviews I have read are praising the Accord\\'s styling as if it\\'s some kind of Audi or something. Only C&D (surprisingly) was honest about the car\\'s homely looks. good thing it has resale value on its side.  Camry has resale value on its side also. But I\\'m not taken with the Camry\\'s styling. Almost like it\\'s trying too hard to be \"hip.\" Still, it\\'s more daring than the Accord.The side view of the Accord looks pretty good to me, if plain. It has a racy slant to it that is accentuated by the strong character line ala the TL. I noticed Honda is favoring the side view in its ads on this site. Good idea, because IMO the front is not at all attractive, looking like something Daewoo might cook up, and the rear looks... well, just odd--as others have noted, like an old Saturn (not a good thing). But make no mistake, Honda will sell tons of these new Accords despite what I or others may think of the styling.  IMO Mercs always looked better than their Ford counterparts.I\\'m talking about waaaaaaaaaaay back,like 1948.In the 50s,they weren\\'t even recognizable as cousins. :blush:  this is the first time I can say the camry looks better than the Accord.Not me. I think that boil on the grill of the Camry needs to be lanced.  oh I didnt mean to suggest the camry was sexy by any means, just that it looks better than Accord. I think Fusion, Aura and Altima are better looking than both. Same goes for new Malibu. Honda can sell a ton of anything- the styling and features of the Accord are largely irrelevant to most buyers. It is significant to me and thats one reason why I wouldnt be driving the 2008 model. I am not a fan of cars that look worse than their predecessors.  I think the backs of the Camry and 2008 Accord are lacking for different reasons. I have never like the current camry\\'s rear end with the bubbly lights and BMW trunk lid. The new Accord\\'s rear is as plain as can be. Many have commented on their dislike of the new Malibu\\'s rear but it has the Accord beat. I cant imagine a duller rear end on a family sedan.  Honda since they are supposed to appeal to a younger crowd than Toyota. Looks like Honda is getting too conservative for their own good. Of course most reviews I have read are praising the Accord\\'s styling as if it\\'s some kind of Audi or something.As a member of the \"younger crowd\" who will readily admit that the three previous generations of Accord (90-02) are better looking than my 2006, I must say I really like the exterior of the 2008 Accord and am still pretty disgusted with the looks of the Camry. I guess there\\'s two sides to every coin. The interior or the prev. gen Accord is still about the best out there at the moment.  I will pass on both and think the current accord looks better than both.  Well, I\\'ve had my 2007 Accord LX 5-speed for 6 full months now, and still think it fits my needs better than most available alternatives. It is an excellent combination of size, weight, quality, comfort, cargo capacity, acceleration, fuel economy, low maintenance, and exceptional value.What other vehicle is midsized, has four doors, feels high-quality, is available in stick shift, can go 0-60 in 7.5 seconds, returns 30 MPG in the city, handles well enough to have fun with, calls for oil changes at 7,500 mile intervals, and can be bought brand new for under $17,000?A V6 Mazda6 fits most of those, I think, although I don\\'t know about the MPG and service intervals.The only real complaints I have about the Accord is a desire for a 6th gear on the freeway and the fold-flat rear seat (no split fold, and the opening is small).  Honda since they are supposed to appeal to a younger crowd than Toyota. Looks like Honda is getting too conservative for their own good. Of course most reviews I have read are praising the Accord\\'s styling as if it\\'s some kind of Audi or something.

I guess there\\'s two sides to every coin.The interior or the prev. gen Accord is still about the best out there at the moment.I like the \\'86-89 & 90-93 styling the best of any Accords so far. The \\'07 is non-offensive but nothing to write home about. I disagree about the interior at this point though, as the dash on the \\'07 is about 3-4 different colors and is evident where each piece intersects. Its especially bad around the passenger air bag. I guess if you have that much dash space, its hard to get the color molding consistent. Its funny because the \\'93 dash, after baking in the sun for 15 years, is still black, all the same color, and not at all cracked. Both Accords do a great job holding an infant seat, and the \\'07 even allows seating on either side.  Looks wise, how many here prefer the Milan to the Fusion? Or are they too close to call. And does the front really remind you of a razor -- hey is that Gillette Fusion razor? In a way, I like that front, as much as I prefer the Milan tail lights.I\\'m one of those who prefer the Milan\\'s back side, the tail lights and the tag being in the bumper instead of the trunk. But, the wife and I definitely liked the front end of the Fusion better. It\\'s really distinctive, among all mid-size sedans.In the end, the Fusion won out. Besides, if the latest rounds of rumors are to be believed, Mercury may go the way of Plymouth and Oldsmobile by 2012.Ford, and hopefully Fusion, will be around for decades to come.Boz  if you want a manual you options are limited to camry, accord, Optima/Sonata and 6 I would say. Fusion and 6 have slightly worse mileage but are sporty and inexpensive. I dont think the Accord is unique in offering an affordable 4 cylinder ride with good mileage. If you drive an auto the Malibu and G6 offer similar mileage at similar prices.  I think the Milan is one of the best looking sedans in the class. I like pretty much every angle of that car. If it had a little more power I might be driving on instead of an Aura.   A couple other options if you want mid-sized interior room are the Sentra (with standard 6-speed, something not available with the Accord/Camry/Mazda6/Sonata/Optima I4s) and the Elantra.  I was looking at automatic with the V6 engine. And those Mazda6 are over priced. Once discounted by $5k they descended into a more realist price. Pity those paying closer to retail. Seems like a nice car. Like any other car, just shop the prices to see how it compares. Close-outs brought it closer to being a safe buy. Otherwise the total price in and out is a lot more than buying an Accord or Camry. That said, as always this it but one consideration. If you like the car, that is possibly above all consideration, unless you are a numbers man -- one that lives to save a penny. Intellichoice will not know about some dealer offering $5K off in your hometown. Things vary. Using an average to buy and the average when sold, Mazda6 will lose. Deep discount and it become more even, but you still may lose. It is not a good game for Mazda. The Miata after 18 years of ownership may still bring you $3,000 or more, but that is the exception. Mazda seems to have soul, which is precious rare these days. L  > Mazda6Happened to pull parking duty at an event Saturday evening at the local high school. I occasionally ask people with new cars how they like their car. The winner for excitement was the Mazda6 owner and his wife. They loved their car. The Camry owners and Accord owners respond without a lot of excitement. But the 6 guy was really pleased with his choice.  For glass area, I am thinking an older BMW, like the 325 or maybe the old real SAABs, just a thought. Recall a time when most cars had windows and you did not feel like you were driving a tank. I do not like the A pillar blind spot and bulkiness. Maybe my next car is a well taken care of European, Japanese or even top line American car, like a Caddy. I even recall the days when you could see the hood. Wonder if the 2008 Accord has hood in view, as I see they have raised the hood in the photos.L  Has anyone seen the Accord for 2008? From the photos, it looks pretty good to me. The front is more orderly to me than is the New Malibu which is split the three ways. New Malibu should be on par with the rest overall for looks. SEE LINK but I am not sure I like the looks of the pricing. Starts at $20K and the as shown is $27K ??? A Malibu @ $27,ooo? Isn\\'t a base SAAB 9-3 something like that with a stick? And are they not deep discounted? It better look like solid gold in the showroom. Will stop in a Caddy dealership to see if the CTS is in the showroom yet. I hope it has not changed so much as to become a clone of a Fusion  with a let\\'s show the world we are a Caddy front. CTS must remain edgy and its own DNA. (as always IMHO, and your smileage will vary )Hey, on the left here and ad shows the Hyundai Sonata, starting at $17,345. Wow, almost $3K under the New Malibu, before discounting. Folks, it is getting pretty ugly out there in the car wars. Good for shoppers though :shades: Loren  For glass area, I am thinking an older BMW, like the 325 or maybe the old real SAABs, just a thought.

It feels low to the ground (and it is, I am looking at the new Accord\\'s door handles from inside the 93), and you can see the road pretty much right in front of the car.  Test drove the Civic before my wife bought the Optima. More money for less car. Seemed noticeably smaller than my 01 Elantra. If you consider \"more money for less car\" then you really should say, more money, for higher quality, nicer smaller car.\"The Optima doesn\\'t get anywhere near the fuel economy of the Civic. I say you get more BANG for your buck with the Civic by saving on gas.   Compare an Accord SE I4 auto to a Mazda6i VE auto.

If you re-read my original post, I was simply stating that an overlooked advantage of any car that holds its value well is the insurance pay out. As I said, its quite satisfying to know that if that car is totaled, state farm will give me nearly 10k for it. thats one area resale can really save your but.  I get the impression (at least here in Southern CA) that car/mechanic shops/oil change shops will tell you to change things that don\\'t need any changing.I bet there\\'s a 70% chance there was nothing wrong with the CV joint and they were just trying to make some money. Seems that 70% of auto mechanics are dishonest these days.  I read in the motor trend 2008 accord/ 2007 camry SE comparo that they thought he SE had a stiffer suspension than the accord... how did it compare to the 6? Was the lean in cornering as bad I\\'ve heard or did do ok? anyway, thanks for sharing your opinions about the car.  That\\'s an ineresting perspective: pay more up front so you can collect more from insurance if your car is totaled. I never thought of it that way.  I don\\'t pay more up front for a better insurance payout. I bought the car because its what my wife wanted. the insurance payout is just a bennifit of the car holding its value. thats all.  the shop is fine. I always deal with the same mechanics in order to avoid those kinds of problems. They always show me the damaged part before and after repairs.  OK. I am glad you brought this up, because now I feel even better about my \\'04 Elantra, which according to KBB would give me an insurance payout of only $1,175 less than what I paid for it 3-1/2 years ago.   If you can get a car others are paying $19,279 for, then go for it. Otherwise it seem to be $835 difference between Mazda and the Honda, and thus costing much more in the long run.As for total package, I looked at the stability control and other items offered in the V6 flavor of the SE series, I decided to go for the V6. As packages go in the Honda line, this particular model, the SE V6 represents the most bang per dollar. L  Guess they use to sell cars by the pound, in ascending dollar value. Today I would say it is in descending order, as the lighter the car the more it cost to build, yet the performance increase can prove to be a positive. Cars handle better with less bulk weight and get more MPG. Heavy could be more steel in areas for safety, which is not a bad thing, but usually it means less engineering done to provide a light and safe car, and less use of lighter metals. If talking interior or overall size, I am thinking a used Crown Vic should do it - plenty large and should be safe. Then there is the Impala for a few more MPG and slightly smaller size.L  As packages go in the Honda line, this particular model, the SE V6 represents the most bang per dollarNot only does the car pass the pipe-smoker\\'s analysis, it\\'s just one heck of a machine.  Here in the Pacific NW, it\\'s pretty common for mazda6\\'s to be advertized for 6-7k off of msrp (including rebates), so it would seem the advantage over an Accord would be at least 3-4k from the start. The Mazda6 was reported to be one of the least expensive midsize cars to insure also. Both the Accord and the Mazda6 have scored well in crash tests where and when side airbags were used on these cars (I include European tests here since some US tests don\\'t use the Mazda6 w/ airbags). The Mazda6 was tested to stop 10 feet shorter than an Accord in midsize comparo\\'s by Edmunds and other car mags and the consensus of these articles have the handling of the 6 as the better of the two without giving up much in terms of comfort. Personally, I like the interior of the Accord because of styling but not because of better materials (the seat material on the 6 I think is better) or because it\\'s bigger (most measurements of leg room and headroom are pretty much equal b/t the current Accord and Mazda6). From an external styling perspective, I much prefer the looks of the 6 and still get compliments from complete strangers pretty frequently. If a buyer of the 6 chooses a hatchback or wagon (which won\\'t be available much longer), the Mazda6 will have the ability to haul much larger objects. Gas mileage on the Accord will likely be about 10% better, which would save the average driver about $500 a year based on 12k miles annual mileage. Jd Powers and Consumer Reports indicate that the difference in reliability is likely to equal less than one problem per car per 5 years (I think the Accord average was around 3 problems and the 6 was a fraction higher). Maybe I\\'ve been watching too much of the US Open lately, but it seems to me the Accord is like Sampras while the Mazda6 is like Agassi. Both are excellent, but their personalities are quiet different. I always had my favorite, but in the end it was very hard to root against any one of them. In the end, a solid case could be made for both and I wouldn\\'t fault anyone for choosing one over the other.  \"Jd Powers and Consumer Reports indicate that the difference in reliability is likely to equal less than one problem per car per 5 years (I think the Accord average was around 3 problems and the 6 was a fraction higher).\"The importance of that one extra problem (which may occur during the time you own the car over 4-7 years) depends, of course, on what that one extra problem ends up being, exactly. If the trademark power swinging vents stop swinging, well, no big deal (for me at least). However, if it ends up being much more serious (and thus expensive and/or unsafe), that is something to consider.Don\\'t get me wrong, I think that JDP and CR data is good for comparison purposes. However, I wish somebody would take it further, maybe weight the results for the severity of typical problems and not just number of occurances. Plus, as I said before, I\\'d like to see breakdowns by model (e.g. not just overall Mazda6 reliability... but Mazda6 I4, V6, and turbo reliability).This would add real value to the results as we would have more accurate data. For instance, if examples of car A have a common failure in the radio, and some examples of car B occasionally have one vital component suddenly fail... even though they have the same number of problems per vehicle, the two cars will no longer be ranked as equal in terms of reliability.This brings up some interesting questions if you really think about it. Example, how much of BMW\\'s reported reliability decline, shown as higher numbers of reported problems per car, might be related to owner complaints about iDrive \"not working\" (when they can\\'t figure out how to operate it) or just simple gadget failures as opposed to real engine or transmission problems?  \"Has anyone seen the Accord for 2008? From the photos, it looks pretty good to me.\"No surprise there. The car isnt ugly but its far from the best looking in class. When there are so many cars of nearly equal size and performance I see no reason to get a boxy Accord. Plus the 2009 6 is coming out next year and based on the pic released it seems to be quite a looker. \"New Malibu should be on par with the rest overall for looks.\"not in my opinion and not in the opinion of many who have seen it in the flesh. \"Isn\\'t a base SAAB 9-3 something like that with a stick?\"The base 9-3 has far less power and less room than a Malibu LTZ. At $27k the Chevy is the better car.  this month\\'s CR - a lengthy report about keeping a car going for 200k+ - how much money that would save (and certainly a point at which the suspect resale values of some of these cars would mean much less) - the 10 recommended models for those few that do keep a car this long consists of 3 Hondas and 7 Toyota products. HMMM - and then folks wonder why cars of those particular brands costs more to buy(new or used) but LESS to own over more usual time frames.  The base 9-3 has far less power and less room than a Malibu LTZ.164/262 for the Ecotec and the 3.6, respectively for the Malibu. 210/250 for the Saab, but both Saab engines are available with manual transmissions.Its just different strokes...one is for people who pick cars based on how much space it takes in their garage and one is for people who like something sporty and fun while dragging their children to-and-fro.  If you consider \"more money for less car\" then you really should say, more money, for higher quality, nicer smaller car.\" The Optima doesn\\'t get anywhere near the fuel economy of the Civic. I say you get more BANG for your buck with the Civic by saving on gas. Of course the Civic gets better fuel economy than the Optima, but that\\'s not really the point here (not to say the Optima has bad F/E, pretty good, actually). There probably were a lot of other factors accounted for the purchase of the Optima instead of the Civic. FWIW, both cars have advantages and drawbacks.  In the end, a solid case could be made for both and I wouldn\\'t fault anyone for choosing one over the other.Good post.This whole Mazda6 vs Accord seems a little uneccessary. It\\'s like comparing BMW and Mercedes: yes they are both in the same cost class, but they are intended for different customers.The Mazda6 probably tends to be bought by younger buyers (lower initial cost, sporty design and handling reputation) or buyers who are looking for something that, at least by reputation, is more sporty.The Accord tends to be bought by folks who want something that has an strong reputation for reliability and great resale.Before I get jumped on, that is not to suggest that either vehicle cannot score points in the other vehicle\\'s strong suit (I have a 6-speed V6 Accord EX-L and would certainly describe it as sporting- just a little undercover...).But I will say I went for the Accord for reliability and resale, performance was a bonus.Again- different customers for each car.  It wasn\\'t bad. I\\'m not a Indy driver but it wasn\\'t as tight and hdid have quite a bit more lean in the corners than the 6. The SE felt a lot bigger and one reason was because of the sight lines from the drivers seat. I like the Mazda because you can almost see the end of the hood and you can see the trunk lid. Turning radius was a little better with the SE but no great shakes. I would put the new SE between older accords which I think were a little tighter than more current ones and the 6.  I did and it took 5 minutes to get the price approved after I presented it to the salesman. I said thanks, said I would be back in three hours to pay and sign papers. Told the salesman I didn\\'t want any add ons, insurance, warranty, other crap. Came back, they had the car prepped and detailed, signed the papers (they even had already checked off all the things I didn\\'t want) and wrote them a check. I would say I spent no more than 30 minutes total buy the car. Fastest in my life but I credit these forums with providing very good information going in.Anyway, if I can do it, anybody can. In fact I don\\'t know anyone that would pay 19,279 for a car that stickers at 21,125 and has a 1,750 rebate. That is already down to 19,375. That\\'t like saying I got WOW, I got $96 off the MSRP. Not much to brag about.  I agree that the Accord and 6 may be designed and marketed to a little different demographic. However, my second choice in this field was the Sonata. Now that is a total different ride/handling and I liked it for it\\'s roominess and features offered per price much like the Mazda. I\\'m certainly not within the so called Mazda demographic, but I was looking for a third vehicle for my wife and I that was reasonably priced, less operatiing cost and a little more fun to drive than a SUV and PU which are our other two vehicles. The Mazda fit the bill this time because of the heavy discounts.  Congrats! Drop by our Dealer Rater page and write up your experience.  Comment at will. The front has a little too much Camry for me and I don\\'t like the red/orange lighting inside. But not bad overall.  I think it looks too much like the Lexus IS250. Not that the IS250 is bad looking, I actually think it is sharp, but I like the current Mazda partly because it does look different than anything else. The interior looks good to me but I wonder what it would look like without the NAV.  \"this month\\'s CR - a lengthy report about keeping a car going for 200k+ - how much money that would save (and  certainly a point at which the suspect resale values of some of these cars would mean much less) - the 10 recommended models for those few that do keep a car this long consists of 3 Hondas and 7 Toyota products. wow, CR said that? What a shock! And its very relevant since tons of owners are interested in keeping their cars for 200k miles. Considering how long the average person keeps a car its pointless to tout how some cars supposedly will last 150k+ miles while others supposedly wont. I think ANY car today can last 150k miles if you maintain it and are willing to pay for the parts that will wear out over time.  \"164/262 for the Ecotec and the 3.6, respectively for the Malibu. 210/250 for the Saab, but both Saab engines are available with manual transmissions. \"the cars are basically the same underneath the skin and the $27k 9-3 does not have 250hp. I would say a Malibu LTZ could hold its own vs a non-Aero 9-3. It should be able to since its on the same platform.  exterior is HOT but interior is lackluster and is barely better than current car. They need to do better inside. Tell you what, its better than the Accord from every angle.  I wonder what it would look like without the NAVPicture is too big to display here, but here is the link:Non NAV stereo  I absolutely LOVE it!Inside and out, it\\'s stylish and sexy, something the Accord and Camry isn\\'t...I still will pass final judgment after the NA version debuts and I can see it in person, but I think I found my next car...   I absolutely LOVE it! We would have never guessed......   I think ANY car today can last 150k miles if you maintain it and are willing to pay for the parts that will wear out over time. Funny, that is almost exactly what CR said also:Any vehicle can reach 200,000 miles if you are willing to keep replacing parts.They also said that cars with over 200k miles represent one-half of one percent of the 1.3 million vehicles in their latest annual survey.  Overall I like the looks, but there\\'s something about the two little windows in the back that break up the otherwise smooth lines of the car. It is somewhat reminiscent of a sporty Azera, or a grown-up Elantra. I don\\'t see any resemblence to the Camry, or Accord--which is a good thing.The shape looks perfect for a 5-door. Too bad Mazda dropped it for 2009.The picture may not do the interior justice, but there\\'s something about it that screams \"cheap hard plastics!\". Hopefully that\\'s not the case. I am also noticing a certain sameness in mid-sized car interiors lately. Maybe that\\'s because car makers get slammed for putting air vents anywhere but high-up, so that\\'s where they go. Then there has to be room for the nav screen. And then it seems almost everyone is using the 3-dial approach for HVAC controls. I love these controls, as they are very easy to use, but they\\'re everywhere now.Kind of different plood on the floor console.  Well Mazda is simply asking too much for the car as suggested retail, if they have to discount it so much. Someone at Ford/Mazda needs to make some changes in the pricing. This deep discount, like GM was doing in recent past, kills the image of the car and any resale value.As a car to buy? Well it is Zoom-Zoom, with that Miata attitude in every car. The Mazda3 has the resale value, but I kinda like the Mazda6 as well. I just hope Ford doesn\\'t kill off Mazda some how. Be it pricing or whatever.L    Is that (this) a hatchback? The trunk looks small and what\\'s up with the indent in the trunk lid? Looks like a mistake. I don\\'t care for the orange/red instrument lighting either.  from auto blog:The only official details we have so far is that the new car will weigh less than the outgoing model and will use less fuel and emit fewer CO2 emissions to boot.An interesting tidbit, but significant for sure. Considering it\\'s bigger, that ought to be very good from a handling perspective that they\\'ve been able to carve out some weight.  Weight was reduced when the new Mazda2 was introduced also.It is encouraging that at least Mazda is not making every new model heavier than the last one.   Like to answer these one by one:quote: No surprise there. The car isnt ugly but its far from the best looking in class. When there are so many cars of nearly equal size and performance I see no reason to get a boxy Accord. Plus the 2009 6 is coming out next year and based on the pic released it seems to be quite a looker.While it is impossible to find a boxy Accord, I too would not buy one, unless it was the 1990 like shape, which was much like the BMW3 look in its time. Very nice. Current renditions, in more aerodynamic shapes are good too.As for comments on looks, I like 99.9% of the public have only photos to go by for the New Malibu and the New Accord, and commented that the looks are on par with the rest. Your response is: quote: not in my opinion and not in the opinion of many who have seen it in the flesh.  Well then OK, it is not then on par. So sorry to hear that.As for my comparing the Saab 9-3 to the cost of the Malibu LTZ, I do realize there is an engine difference. Of course if you can not drive fast with 210HP, 252HP won\\'t do you any good. It is a drive, handling kinda thing. Seriously, they do have a different nature about them, but what I am saying is that image wise, as in what one perceives as a value of a brand, the SAAB is going to win every time against that of a Malibu. Now, it could be the new SAAB is nothing more than another Epsilon GM car, with a different motor, but I would hope for more. The better handling, more world class interior, and safety beyond the common car. Or is it just another mid-sized average car? If it truly is a SAAB and is priced at or below the New Malibu, when discounted, then I think the New Malibu is well overpriced. In total in and out cost of ownership, they have to come in under the competition, not with the price or over the price. If you can but the Aura XR for $24K with $1,500 or more discounts, how the heck do they justify $27K say for the New Malibu? Dang, there are Passats, Accords, Camrys, Altimas, and more for that price, with some nice equipment. Someone at GM, please get out the calculator again, or take off the shoes when counting. L  Very nice. Looks like a Lexus or something :shades: very cool indeed.L  LOL, admit it, you just hate Honda Accord.I LOVE the interior, I think it is the best looking interior out of all midsizers, including the current Accord. When will this one be available to us? I am seriously thinking about trading my IS350 for an AWD version. Which V6 will this one pack? The Ford 3.5L or Japan Mazda\\'s 3.8?  Gas mileage on the Accord will likely be about 10% better, which would save the average driver about $500 a year based on 12k miles annual mileage. You better check your math. If 10% saves $500, that means $5000 in annual gas cost. That\\'d be about 1600 gallons. which is enough to go about 40,000 miles. :surprise: 10% would be more like $150 per year...which is right about what fueleconomy.gov comes up as the difference, at least for the 4 cyl automatics.  The shape looks perfect for a 5-door. Too bad Mazda dropped it for 2009. 2008 Mazda6 Sedan, Hatchback and Wagon:Unless those are only for the European market.   the cars are basically the same underneath the skin and the $27k 9-3 does not have 250hp. I would say a Malibu LTZ could hold its own vs a non-Aero 9-3. It should be able to since its on the same platform.Depends on what you are looking for. If you just want to put car seats in then I\\'m sure either would be fine, but since the Chevy has no manual transmission, it has no intention of being a sports sedan, body kit or not.  The wagon looks really cool, very Audi-esqe. A 3.5 V6 and a 6 speed manual and the kids get to soccer practice on time. Whats not to love?  Are you sure that Mazda6 photo is not a hatchback? It has a rear wiper and almost no trunk lid. I know they are dropping the \"5-door\", but maybe that is the case just in the US???Not a fan of the new exterior appearance, glad I got the current version.  :blush: man, my math sux. or maybe I felt like being generous to the Accord owners since I\\'ve been a bit sharp with them lately. ah well, put that into the mazda6\\'s bonus column!  I swear I read that the Mazda6 hatch and wagon were being dropped from the U.S. market for 2009. But if not... great!This angle of the hatch reminds me of another mid-sizer though... the Sebring. :P  I heard that they were dropping the wagon for the 2008 model year, but the 2009 model line has not been released yet. The speculation though has been that the US will get the hatch and sedan but not the wagon. We\\'ll find out for sure in a couple weeks. and to jeffyscott, I\\'d have to agree about the exterior; it doesn\\'t seem to have as much flow to it. there are a couple elements I like, like the fogs and folding side mirrors, but no turn signals on the mirrors and no side markers? doesn\\'t seem very safe, especially with a lot of bicyclists on my way to work. and it looks like the rear of the car is a bit higher which may make rearward visibility worse. The pronounced wheel arches still give it that \"mazda\" look, which is good. And the taillights look like what they have been playing around with on their concept cars.The interior shots I like a lot. The brushed aluminum trim is much better than the current chrome and I like what they have done with the seats (similar to what they have done with the cx7 & cx9). I also like that the interior isn\\'t so monotone. But for mazda, the most important thing will be how it drives, so I\\'ll wait for that info. Still exciting though!  Very true, there are plenty of Model A on the road, and some Model T\\'s. In Cuba most cars are what, say in the 1950\\'s era? I see almost as many \\'65 and \\'66 Mustangs on the road as the New Stang..... OK a little exaggeration. If trying to save money, just get a used Impala, Crown Vic or something pretty basic and drive it \\'till it drops. In most cases people want more than just the cheapest to own vehicle. For a commuter or work car, almost any used domestic, bought near half price in say three years time or so, should do. A salesman friend of my Dad said he use to buy a Civic with 100K on the odometer and drive it another 100K then start on over again, and said it worked for him back when he was a salesman. He liked the gas mileage and the cheap car to buy and still was able to sell it for something after 200K. One could argue that the Japan cars are best to take to 200K, just as well as there are valid arguments on the domestic car side of the issue, and those cars could be as cheap or cheaper to 200K. I would bet on the Japan make for in the i4 engines, and the domestics with the V6 & V8 may have the dollar edge over that period of time. Like I said, would bet on, and I doubt anyone has enough research to say one way or another, with any certainty. Would there not be two classes of long lived experiences, or is that three. The commuter may buy a Hyundai, or say the Civic and drive it until it dies, as would someone who sees a car as transportation. That be two classes, which are closely related. The third class is the collector, or one in love with the car. If I am gonna drive a car to 200K, I would really want something desirable to drive, a I am not the commuter to work class of driver. How much the car costs to own over the period is not as important as how good the ownership experience is. Just trying to imagine say 15 years of owning a Beretta, or Taurus or..... well let\\'s say it would seem an eternity.L  The photo\\'s are of the 2009 Mazda6. The Wagon was dropped for the 2008 model. 2008 is a continuation of the current design.  To sum up what I\\'ve heard about the \\'09:Initial rumors had both the 5-door and wagon dropped for NA in \\'09, but lately, there has been talk of the 5-door resurfacing here for the second-gen model. The 3.5L V6 from Ford will NOT be used (since Ford can\\'t supply enough of them, supposedly), but the 3.7L V6 that\\'s currently in the CX-9 will step in. I\\'ve heard that the 3.7L is slightly related to the 3.5L DT, but extensively reworked by Mazda, and I\\'ve also heard it\\'s a Mazda-only design. Either way, it\\'ll supposedly be built in Japan. Expect about 265-270 HP.The 6-speed manual and 6-speed auto is a certainty, and since it\\'s based on the Mondeo platform, so will optional AWD. It may be a modified version of the Haldex with RWD-bias, similar to the SH-AWD that Honda has.It will be larger, but Mazda claims it\\'ll be lighter than the current car, with better gas mileage.Of course, this is all speculation, and we\\'ll find out more when press days start at the Frankfurt show on the 11th (hopefully).  I knew I should have done the lease on the Accord. Oh well, resale value, right?  and \\'keeping replacing parts\\' is exactly where the rub is, isn\\'t it? And maybe the reason why Toyota and Honda products deserve primary consideration in that unlikely event you are going to keep anything that long? Statistics, as a rule, generally don\\'t deceive!  And after all that the Malibu still looks better than the Accord. If you havent seen a boxy accord I would check out pics of the 2008 ASAP. All your questions will be answered.I have seen the Malibu in the flesh but not the Accord. The accord better look WAY better in the flesh if its to match the \"on par\" Malibu. Styling is subjective but you seem to be in the minority in terms of praising the new Accord design. The Accord has been getting worse looking with each generation for some time now so this is no surprise. They dont want the car to offend an aging buyer base. Makes sense I guess.  \"And maybe the reason why Toyota and Honda products deserve primary consideration in that unlikely event you are going to keep anything that long? \"most people dont and even if I did I dont think Toyota and Honda products deserve \"primary\" consideration. The pics of the new 6 are one more example of why those two companies have little appeal to me. They put no effort into design and it shows.  The picture may not do the interior justice, but there\\'s something about it that screams \"cheap hard plastics!\".I\\'m glad somebody noticed and said this besides me. I see the same thing in the interior pictures, the new Mazda SCREAMS \"cheap plastics!\" I don\\'t know about the \"hard\" part, but definitely looking Dodgish on the inside. I hope the materials appear better in person. I like the styling overall, though the interior is pretty bland style-wise, with a \"sporty\" character, but all the guts are bland.The outside is very nice, but I don\\'t know about the 3 part rear side windows.  \"LOL, admit it, you just hate Honda Accord. I LOVE the interior, I think it is the best looking interior out of all midsizers, including the current Accord. When will this one be available to us? I am seriously thinking about trading my IS350 for an AWD version. Which V6 will this one pack? The Ford 3.5L or Japan Mazda\\'s 3.8? \"dont hate the accord but the styling speaks for itself, especially after seeing the 6.The interior of the 6 is another story though, they did not go far enough. The plastic appears to be the same old hard black stuff you find in most mazdas. The interior without nav is just OK and is no better than the 3 in my book. As of right now the Accord with nav is probably the most upscale looking interior in class.  I personally will probably never keep a car to 200k miles. I only put 8-10K miles a year on each of our cars, and the car will probably rust out from all the road salt long before it hits 200k miles.I do know that the one Honda I owned for longer than 3 years, a Civic that I owned for almost 8 years and 80k miles, required more in replacement parts than any other car I\\'ve owned, including vehicles from so-called unreliable brands such as Dodge and Hyundai. So statistics can deceive if people think that they guarantee a reliable car, short- or long-term, just because the average reliability of its brand is a tick higher percentage-wise than another brand.  Design is more than about just aesthetics. Design is also about designing a car to last 20 years and 300,000 miles with minimal maintenance, and virtually no repair costs. Design is about not saving money on inferior components so as to increase profit margins at sale while driving up warranty and consumer car costs later on.  Accord styles:\\'90-\\'93: Boxy\\'94-\\'97: Round\\'98-\\'02: Boxy\\'03-\\'07: Round\\'08-: Boxy  So statistics can deceive if people think that they guarantee a reliable car, short- or long-term, just because the average reliability of its brand is a tick higher percentage-wise than another brand. Yes, there\\'s no guarantee you\\'ll win the hand when you have 20 in blackjack, but I\\'d take a hand of 20 over a hand of 17 any day of the week, and twice on Sunday. A tick higher in reliability??? are you kidding? :confuse: If your talking about Toyota over Honda over the years, then perhaps, but if your talking about those two vs. say Dodge or Saab, or even VW, then you had better get ready for more than a few ticks of difference, more like, perhaps, a decent high school football team facing last years Superbowl NFL winners.  So I wonder if Mazda would ever consider the \"active suspension\" that the Mondeo will be getting where the driver can change the suspension characterstics (like land rover)? But one thing I\\'ve really liked about the current 6\\'s suspension is that it is both firm and compliant where there is not a lot of body roll but bumps rarely show up as being harsh and are absorbed and softened nicely. After seeing what Mazda has been releasing over the last 6 years, it\\'s amazing how much they have changed and improved. From a stable of really forgetable cars except the rx-7 to where they are now, Mazda has become a company with soul and a focus to offer fun to drive cars that are stylish and affordable.  Design is also about designing a car to last 20 years and 300,000 miles with minimal maintenance, and virtually no repair costs.When you find a mid-sized sedan/family car like that, one that has virtually no repairs for 20 years or 300,000 miles, please let us all know so we can rush out and get one!   Oh I see it now. New Malibu has two grills to the Accord one grill up front. That is quite the difference. Look there is nothing wrong with the basic New Malibu car, as is there is nothing wrong with the New Accord looks wise. They raised the hood on the Accord and thus it looks blockier to you. If you can actually see the hood, on the Accord or any car, I say good - very good, as most all cars these days have no visible front from the drivers seat. If you want an example of real Body by Fisher GM style, you must go back to 68  I think there\\'s a lot of early 90\\'s Accord\\'s out there that will reach that goal in a few years time.  I guess. I think of a true box as the 1965 car. Recall how all had the sharp edges. Today, a box is rounded so, it is so aerodynamic it looks smooth to me. And the top swoops down in back. Now the \\'65 Falcon is a box. Oh yeah, some of the old Fiats and BMW. How about the kind of box, the Volvo\\'s of days gone bye? The Audi 4000 and 5000 were very popular as the rounded edge box designs. Ford loved it and copied it as the first Taurus design, which was so very popular. Maybe Honda is just doing this Accordantly. just trying to be helpful, Loren  When the new 6 arrives to the US, they won\\'t be 2008MY, but rather, 2009MY.Both the Sport Wagon variant and MazdaSpeed6 are dropped for the 2008MY (US market). No word yet (obviously) what the lineup will be when the new version hits in 2008 as a 09MY.The reason for two trims being dropped having much to do with demand/supply than anything. I know Mazda originally planned to sell 140K of the 6 annually, well, they are well short of such goal (I think they are averaging about 70K, which is even less than the 626, IIRC). This should help, however.  There are talks this version might not come to the US. This might be Euro-only (maybe the domestic market as well). We shall see what happens but if this is true, then it would be a similar situation as the Euro Accord (TSX) and NA Accord.  I think there\\'s a lot of early 90\\'s Accord\\'s out there that will reach that goal in a few years time.With enough money, sure. There are 2 on Craigslist right now in my area with blown oil seals (a $1200 repair at the dealer including the timing belt service - btdt). I \\'m not complaining, the car is 15 years old, but a Neon will make it to 200k if you replace the head gasket when it goes.  I really like the looks and specs we have so far of the new Mazda6. I, too, am excited to hear that the new body style will weigh less than the current model. Coupled with the increases in horsepower, this new Mazda should be formidable. Any word on pricing?I just hope that by the time a manual transmission model hits my local dealer, they will have forgotten about the Mazdaspeed Mazda6 and MX-5 which I drove but didn\\'t buy, and they will let me drive one of the new 6\\'s...  LOL..... where are there Neons with 200,000 miles.... show me two....A Neon would have to have head gaskets replaced 4 times already to reach 200K. It would also be on its 4th transmission, and I\\'d assume the engine wouldn\\'t last that long either. I know for a fact the body won\\'t last that long, the suspension, the frame, and the entire car basically start to disintegrate at around 5 years or 60,000 miles.  Since when is a Neon a midsize?And for the record, there are at least 3 Neon\\'s in the parking lot where I work with 200,000 miles plus and they all have original headgasket and engine and only one of them is on the second transmission.  >The Accord has been getting worse looking with each generation for some time now so this is no surprise. They dont want the car to offend an aging buyer base. Makes sense I guess.The 2003 with the oddly canted side profile for the rear was the worst. The refresh where they copied the LaCrosse/Impala taillights helped improve the looks.  Can we PLEASE not start up this conversation again with the 300K Accord vs. a Neon (or whatever)? It was boring and pointless the first time around...  I agree, how many 300K Mazda\\'s are out there?  Know any owners of those? I\\'d like to find out how they got through 20 years w/o any repairs--or \"virtually\" any repairs I should say. My two pampered Hondas couldn\\'t make it through as few as 3 years w/o a repair. One had a clutch, muffler, and A/C condenser go out and major rust appear within 5 years.   Yes, I have an old friend who last I checked in with had a Honda Accord with 280,000+ miles and it was running strong (in fact he showed me how strong when he got it up to about 115 MPH on the freeway).Of course, I do believe he got a 2006 Honda Accord EX, so he probably traded it in back then.... but let me get back to you on that....Clutches are a wear item, like brakes. By virtually no repairs I think I mean no repairs costing $1,000 or more.  I think they just dropped for the 2008 short run and bringing them back in 2009 which the latest I\\'ve seen is going on sale around May or June. Yeah, the Sebring looks like a hatch without the benefits of a hatch!  Clutches are a wear item, like brakes. By virtually no repairs I think I mean no repairs costing $1,000 or more.That pretty much excluded everything except a blown engine or bad tranny. I don\\'t even think a shot suspension will cost over one grand.On a second thought, maybe it will...   Not quite 20 years, but my father has an 14 year old Accord with 178K with no repairs. He did have to replace wear and tear items such as the tires (4th set), 2 mufflers, brakes pads several times(no rotors), and timing belt/water pump @ 90K. He\\'s changed the oil every 3-4K miles, annual air filter change and replaced the spark plugs twice and that\\'s it.Absolutely no mechanical repairs in the 14 years he\\'s owned it. His front windows stopped working earlier this summer however. But he seems to live with it and is determined to get 200k before he gets another car.I\\'ve driven it a few times and the motor is still strong. Interior is shot though and the rear panels are rusting.I\\'m hoping he\\'ll get to 200k w/o having to replace the timing belt.  \"Virtually no repair cost\" means up to $999 per repair? Give me a break.Although a 1986 Accord going 115 mph is pretty darn good. But it\\'s one car. I see Buick Centurys of that vintage driving around all over town. It\\'s been years since I\\'ve seen a Gen 3 Accord.  A water pump is not mechanical? It is software perhaps?So he has only 6 years and 122k miles to go to make it to that magic 300k and 20 years with virtually no repairs. Good luck to him!  For just a little bit, maybe a day or so, let\\'s not post about the Accord at all!!There are so many other cars in this segment that the constant arguing debate about the Accord seems so silly. There are several other tired old beaten-up horses that would also very much appreciate a break.Challenge: try some new cars for a change. Just for a day or so. We can leave out the three or four regulars for a bit and see what else would be good to debate compare.  A \"mechanical repair\" implies that something was broken. Replacing the timing belt and water pump is part of scheduled maintenance. You have to remove the timing belt to replace the water pump, so they are typically replaced at the same time.  I agree that the updated 06/07 Accord taillights were an improvement, but, unless Honda has ESP, the 2006 Accord taillights couldn\\'t be a copy of the 2006 Impala taillights. The LaCrosse taillights are similar, but not that close.  OK, thanks for the explanation. I\\'ve never owned one of the cars that includes water pump replacement as scheduled maintenance.  Timing belts go for at least 90k miles (even more now), so it\\'s usually the second owner who has it done. If you have the ability to change it yourself, it\\'s cheap maintenance.   I wouldn\\'t want to be in that car going 115...  Ok, Who here owns a Galant, Legacy, or Optima?You\\'ve been awful quiet; tell us about it!  >06/07 Accord taillights were an improvement,I agree with you on that. And for the other I don\\'t know the development timeline for taillights on Impala vs. Accord. There may be someone who knows that no previews of Impala or Accord were proposed early enough that one copied the other. The LaCrosse is an effete application of the shape; the Impala and Accord are crisp and masculine. I just think it\\'s humorous they look so similar. Good taste.  I don\\'t know about the 3 part rear side windows. It looks to me like maybe the last \"window\" section is actually a black plastic filler piece. Something that they use on the current 5-door, but not the sedan (which has only glass for the side windows).  Well, they may last 90k miles, but in most states they are on the manufacturer\\'s maintenance schedule for replacement every 60k miles. If you happen to have a car with a warranty beyond 60k (as do several of them in this class), and you don\\'t replace the belt around 60k and it breaks after that, say at 90k, good luck trying to get the engine repairs covered.  In my owner\\'s manual for my 1996 model, it states 90k. That\\'s all the evidence I need to tell me 60k isn\\'t necessary.

For those of you who \"REGULARLY\" drive your (7th gen V6 only) Accord in temperatures above 110 degrees F, or below -20 degrees F, you should change your timing belt at 60,000 miles. For the rest of us, we can change ours at 105,000 miles. Do you live where these conditions exist? If you do, I feel for you.   Well, legally - from a title and insurance point-of-view - I own a Galant, but it\\'s really my son\\'s car! It has been totally reliable, even though he\\'s rather tough on it and quite negligent on routine maintenance. Currently, it has 165,000 miles on the clock, and it just keeps going (it\\'s a 1996). The last maintenance was a timing belt, water pump, and P.S. pump a few months ago. It\\'s been a good car for him, really bullet-proof. We bought it used in June 2001, and it\\'s never let him down, nor been in the shop, except for preventive or proactive corrective maintenance. The 2.4L balance-shaft I4 doesn\\'t burn any oil, but it leaks a bit from the distributor seal off of the cam cover. And, the 4-speed automatic still is original and shifts fine.Oh, and on the previous post, we see -20F occasionally here, but only 100F rarely, more like 95F. Still tough conditions for most vehicles.  I think this pic shows it to be glass...unless you\\'re talking about the \"tip\".If you want to see a blind spot in the rear 3/4, sit in the current Accord Coupe!  quote: \"For just a little bit, maybe a day or so, let\\'s not post about the Accord at all!! \"OK, I guess we could do that Accordingly. Oh doh! :blush: L  Timing belts on interference engines...why do they do that? How much would it cost to have a chain? Does Honda still do this with the Accord? Any others in this midsize group that have a timing belt and an interference engine?  I agree with you. In my area I see a lot of late 80\\'s Buicks and Oldsmobiles running around, but, no similar vintage Accords or Camrys. Regards:OldCEM  I have read that in CA and some other states, the timing belt replacement interval is 105k miles, but in many other states (such as MN) it\\'s 60k miles. Maybe in colder states, where the temperatures can get below zero (and also over 100, sometimes it seems in the same week :sick: ), the manufacturers adjust the maintenance schedules accordingly (Pat, that last was NOT a mention of the Accord).Actually, I don\\'t have to change the timing belt on one of my vehicles at 60k because it has a timing chain, which many vehicles in this class have. They wear out eventually, but go far beyond 60k miles even in the Great White North.  The current V6 Accord has a timing belt. I think it\\'s because a chain would be too long and heavy. A belt is lighter, so it takes less hp to turn. The benefits of the belt obviously outweigh the cost of changing the belt every 105k miles. Since I am mechanically inclined enough to change it myself, I can do it pretty cheap.   The front looks similar to the Mazda3; side is a complete fascimille of the new European Mondeo and the rear a Chrysler Sebring lookalike. Interior pictures are not clear; hopefully Mazda can put better quality plastics there than the current 6, as well as good engines. I would be interested in knowing what 4 cyl they use for this iteration. V6 seems to be covered.When are other details to be released? Frankfurt?  \"If you want to see a blind spot in the rear 3/4, sit in the current Accord Coupe!\"Why compare a sedan with a coupe? A swoopy coupe will have more blind spots than a sedan or a hatchback.  because a blind spot is a blind spot and it\\'s part of the list above.  I saw a first generation Prelude today.  As for those late 80\\'s Buicks and Oldsmobiles you mentioned, maybe they just look that old?the preceding was a test of the national 1487 alert system.....this was only a test!L  The strange new blind spots are cars with side air bags. A good safety feature, except for those which happen to run into or over someone. :surprise: due to those fat A pillars. You gotta swing and sway the head some times to see what could be hidden otherwise.L  Okay, so would it be fair if I said that the Mazda RX8 has big blind spots? Especially in this context? Compare apples to apples, not oranges.  the rx8 is listed in the cars above?!?! I think that might be a different category.... Look, someone mentioned that the c-pillar in the mazda pic looked like it may not be glass so it would make a huge blind spot. I showed a pic that showed the 3rd window was glass, and mentioned that there was a car that is included in the list of cars at the top of this thread that has a huge blind spot which is one of the reasons I did not buy it. The fact that this car happens to have a name Honda Accord makes it a topic that\\'s fair game. And why are you so sensitive to my talking about a car that you think should not be in this discussion yet cars like the civic and 20 year old cars are brought up without your saying a thing? Of all the things to become sensitive about you get upset about me talking about the Accord coupe\\'s huge blind spot...  The K24A (2.4L I4) in my 2007 Accord has a timing chain.  I don\\'t understand why everyone isn\\'t using timing chains instead of belts. It\\'s not like it\\'s brand-new technology.A belt is lighter, so it takes less hp to turn. The benefits of the belt obviously outweigh the cost of changing the belt every 105k miles.Yeah, right.The ONLY advantage a belt has is initial cost. Yes, a chain may weigh a pound or two more, but if you compare two EXACT engines, one with a belt, one with a chain, the HP difference would be negligible at best. Plus, the chances that a chain will leave you stranded compared to a belt are slim to nil.A belt is just another way for automakers/part makers/mechanics to make $$$.  And since this IS all on a Sonata site how about those too. I was beginning to wonder if Accord/Camry are the only cars worth debating (yeah ACCORDing to some [no pun intended] they are) but I know better.  With this reasoning how do you explain that the less expensive I4 in an Accord uses a chain, where the more expensive 6 cylinder Accord uses a belt ? Engineering wise there must be a reason and it doesn\\'t seem to be cost.  Tell us about your rental Sonata and Optima that you mentioned in another discussion.  The RX8 has been mentioned in this forum before. Anyway, my point was that one can\\'t compare a coupe\\'s blind spots with a sedan\\'s, and not that the Accord coupe is not a part of this discussion. Now, if you were comparing the Accord coupe\\'s blind spot with the Altima or G6 coupe\\'s, that would be a different matter.  I personally am all for timing chains; however the reason I believe that belts were predominant till recently was the smoothness imparted by a rubber belt compared to a metal chain (NVH). In cars from the 50s vintage, I believe all cars used to have chains, and later on these were replaced by rubber belts.Today, that is not the case, most of the disadvantages of chains are gone, so we see more and more engines with chains instead of belts.  Who here owns a Galant, Legacy, or Optima? When I bought the Contour, within 2 days I was totally sure I made the right choice. I loved that car. \\'96 SE V6 with a stick and loaded...man that car was so fun, and the seats were incredibly comfortable. Anyway, that car got replaced by a \\'05 Legacy wagon 2.5i stick for my family. Again, within a couple of days, I knew I had made the right choice. It does everything I could possibly ask of it, returns good fuel economy, and has been flawless since we got it. Mileage is strong (real world mileage has been comparable to its FWD counterparts), it has a wagon body style that has proven very useful, it tows a small trailer with no issues, visibility is very good and the seat height adjusts which is important because my wife is so short. I even like the headlamp cut off pattern.The only things I don\\'t like are the way the infant seat fits in the middle spot and the lack of space left over for other booties in the back seat. I also wish I had gone up 1 model to the 2.5i Limited for the heated seats/mirrors and sunroof.** edit ** I forgot to mention, the car is fantastic in foul weather, even with the below par RE-92s  If you are going to post pictures, can\\'t you at least have the courtesy to learn how to size them, so they fit on the pages properly.? :mad: :confuse:  Yes, I think one of the reasons belts dominated for awhile is that they are quieter. But lately it seems chains are dominating the new engine designs. For example, Hyundai/Kia is now using chains on both their new I4s and V6s, but still using belts on the older engines e.g. the Beta II.  The Contour had a timing chain, the only time it required a hook was when the water-pump failed. The water-pump had failed under warranty and was replaced at that time as well, so timing chain and 3 water-pumps, one of the a catastrophic failure.The Accord has had 3 water-pumps, each replaced at the timing belt service. Total bill for Ford Contour $580 + 12 towing (\"repairs\"), total bill for Honda Accord $1800 (\"maintenance\").  back when I had my Legacy, I had to take it in for service and was given a 2005 4 cylider auto w/ manumatic for a loaner and I was very impressed. I liked the interior, especially the gauge cluster. During my lunch break, I decided to take it for a spin and was very impressed with it\\'s handling. Much like my 1996 Legacy GT, the steering was very direct and positive while torque at lower rpms was decent making coming out of corners pretty fun. I\\'d imagine having a manual would be the better way to go though. Still, the car was quiet but not isolated; a great car with a lot in common to the sonata and accord.  f you are going to post pictures, can\\'t you at least have the courtesy to learn how to size them, so they fit on the pages properly.?They aren\\'t my pictures so I don\\'t control the size - I only link to them.On my 14\" laptop the pictures are only 7.5\" wide and they fit just fine on my 12\" wide screen. Maybe you need to adjust your settings.  Much like my 1996 Legacy GT, the steering was very direct and positive while torque at lower rpms was decent making coming out of corners pretty fun. I\\'d imagine having a manual would be the better way to go though. Still, the car was quiet but not isolated; a great car with a lot in common to the sonata and accord.I concur, the NVH characteristics are very different than the \\'07 Accord EX. I like the way the Subie kicks a little when you turn it on, since the engine is longitudinally mounted, and the flat-4 growls a little more. Its definitely a more connected, tactile driving experience.The Accord, with the exception of wind and tire noise, is pretty darn quiet. I actually like the noise it makes when you turn it on, because that is pretty much the only indication there is an engine in the vehicle.  I think I am with you on this, I would think \"virtually no repair cost\" should be in the under even $500 range, of course, not counting normal wear/tear items. Repairs up to $1000 seems way too high to be \"no repair cost\" to my way of thinking. I have come from an entirely different time era though, so maybe what I think really doesn\\'t count in this forum any more.van  I think I am with you on this, I would think \"virtually no repair cost\" should be in the under even $500 range, of course, not counting normal wear/tear items.

Even $500 adds up if its a monthly expense. That is what happened with the old vehicle, is the average monthly repair/maintenance cost got too close to the car payment of something new.  Thank you for replying, sorry if that is the case. My settings (1024/768) are fine on every other location however. On THIS SITE ONLY, my monitor seems to have problems with many pictures that \"blow\" the entire page, and it is a 19\" monitor. Whatever the problem this site frequently receives photos that are too over-sized, and the host usually mentions how to correct the problems. Sorry, but it just really bugs me when it happens.van  I like the handling of the Legacy too. Also the AWD is a plus (also a minus, for FE). I actually looked closely at the Legacy last year when prices were really good. But the tight back seat was the main blocker for me. Also I realized I don\\'t need AWD very often, and I was not willing to pay the FE penalty for the few times I\\'d use it. I also thought the ride was a little harsher (and noisier) than I\\'d like, considering all the bad roads I have to drive on every day.  Actually, they probably are too wide for many people. When that is the case people have to scroll from left to right to read every line on the page that contains them. One way to fix it is post them on your CarSpace page and then use the automatically generated code to display them here. That way they\\'ll be the correct size.I\\'ve looked at them with two computers - on one the page was fine and on the other the page was skewed.Here\\'s a tip for anyone having to scroll left to right in a situation similar to this. If you click on the message number following the pictures, the page will redisplay starting with that message which gets the pictures off your page. At least you can then more easily read the messages that follow.  That sounds like a browser problem. Next time I\\'ll just post the link.  Yes, I was talking about what you must be calling the \"tip\" (I had meant to say that the side windows actually seem to be 4 parts, but the 4th looks to be black plastic). I didn\\'t mention it because of possible blind spots (that\\'s what side mirrors are for) but because, if they have the plastic filler piece, they cheaped out on this in the new sedan model. It\\'s not a big deal, but how much would it cost to just have glass there? Or if you don\\'t want the cost of the odd shaped glass, then don\\'t design the c pillar like that.It\\'s still not clear to me whether it\\'s plastic or glass...if glass, it is kind of wierd to have two little pieces back there.  Your pictures appear fine to me.  Thanks for the info. I bet something like 600 pixel width would fit nicely. Speaking of fitting nicely, is there such a thing as too big for smaller and mid-size classed cars. I am not sure if I am in the majority, or minority here, on the issue of size but it seems to me like a small car or a mid-size car blown up, as they are once again doing, is simply wrong. If I want to buy a tank or a land yacht I would do so. I happen to live in a city with narrow streets, so a car like the CTS fit pretty darn good. It is a mid-size car, or at least it was. An inch or two difference is not going to render the car impossible to navigate or park in those narrow space, but it means they are on the track for super-sizing. Seems like if the Civic grows any more, it will be a mid-sized car, and the Fit no doubt grows to replace it. How silly is that? Plans for the new Camaro and Challenger cars call for a monster width nearing 80\", which is pretty much truck width or some barge like a Town Car. What\\'s up with that? I thought super-sized Pony car, as in too large Mustang killed sales back in the early 70\\'s. They took a wonderful sporty size, then kept growing into something it was never meant to be.There is the value of the SUV and Minivan, as mass people movers, they fill the gap left from the largest of cars in width leaving the market.I personally, as in IMHO, see most cars, even the new Impala as better if they keep width and length under control, and leave the 5 to 7 passenger capacity to say the minivan. This is not to say a mid-sized or large car or today can not carry five, or possibly six people, but are they in great comfort, or feel more like a hostage? I have a mid-sized car, and it could carry five across town, but I would not want to go cross country. There is no way I am wanting this car though to be larger, and I here it grew an inch taller and three inches longer. To me that is alright, if you want a large car. It is no longer a mid-sized. Let the SUV/Minivan/Crossdresser vehicles carry the massive loads, IMHO.One more thing on size. Not sure the Epsilon GM cars need an extra inch in with as much as possibly narrowing that central area of the console so the knee doesn\\'t hit there or rests easier there, when the foot is on gas. This could be a case where adding an inch is needed, unless it can be done on the inside only. Maybe both, an inch overall car width and eke out an extra inch inside in addition for add a couple. Just a thought. I find the Aura to be pretty comforatable, but a little change wouldn\\'t hurt, especially in this super-sized world of cars and people. :shades:   I like the handling of the Legacy too. Also the AWD is a plus (also a minus, for FE). I actually looked closely at the Legacy last year when prices were really good. But the tight back seat was the main blocker for me. Also I realized I don\\'t need AWD very often, and I was not willing to pay the FE penalty for the few times I\\'d use it.We were primarily shopping the Legacy against the Accord, and the 23/30 vs 26/34 was okay with us. Now that we have one of each, the mileage seems pretty much the same in real world driving. We also liked the wagon body style.I also thought the ride was a little harsher (and noisier) than I\\'d like, considering all the bad roads I have to drive on every day.I agree, the ride is firmer than the Accord, and it is definitely a more active driving experience. This was one of the things we really liked about it...one man\\'s pain is another man\\'s pleasure?  If your mirrors are adjusted correctly you really shouldn\\'t have a blind spot in any car. I was talking to a friend and they were talking about a blind spot. I told them to lean towards the center of the car and adjust the passenger side mirror so they could see the other lane. When they leaned back to driver postition they said they couldn\\'t see the side of their car. I said why do you want to see the side of your car, the object is to see the other car, not yours. Same thing on the driver side. Lean over to where your head hits the window and adjust the mirror out so you see the lane next to you, not the side of your car. I find that when I adjust the mirrors like this I can drive looking pretty much straight ahead and if I\\'m in the middle of three lanes I can see the lane behind and both sides by glancing at the mirrors. I might lean a couple of inches but I certainly don\\'t have any blind spots. I noticed this when I would drive the car after my wife drove it. The mirrors would be angled so far in towards the car I couldn\\'t believe it. I find lots of people need to see the side of their car through the side mirrors and that just isn\\'t the point.  Here are some counterpoints.Setting Outside Mirrors to the Correct Angle  \"Design is more than about just aesthetics. Design is also about designing a car to last 20 years and 300,000 miles with minimal maintenance, and virtually no repair costs. \"actually that is engineering, not design. I dont care if my car last 20 years since I\\'m not keeping it that long. Dont act like most imports stay on the road that long either. No need for the hyperbole to hype up the durability of imports.  there is nothing \"wrong\" with the 2008 Accord\\'s styling but unlike Chevy it appears they put minimal effort into the design. Its obvious that design wasnt a high priority on that car. The Malibu may not be the greatest design ever but effort was made and its generally thought of as an attractive car. The accord seems to be modeled after the 2006 Sonata. BTW, my car has a hood that is visable from the driver\\'s seat. Dont think that is exclusive to the Accord.  Yep, been doing the side mirrors sort of that way for years. But I think the way to do it is lean your head over and then adjust that mirror so you can just see the side of your car. Then when your head is back in the center you won\\'t see the side of your car, but will have little or no blind spot (The front of a passing car will appear in your peripheral vision before the back of it leaves the side mirror).And if I do need to see the side of my car, such as backing around something I can do so by leaning my head over.Another advantage of this mirror setting is you don\\'t get headlight glare, via the side mirror, from cars that are directly behind you.  Appreciate the link. I understand the arguments against the \"new way\". However, if you draw normal width traffic lanes around the vehicles you can see that the vehicle with mirrors adjusted traditionally would leave huge blind spots directly in the lanes to the right and left. I have used this new method for thirty years and I have never failed to keep track of a vehicle in my rear view mirror as it moves and is then picked up in the side mirror. Same as when the overtaking vehicle moves out of view in my side mirror it is then showing in my peripheal vision.In the illustration for vehicle one, it seems that the total of all mirrors views end up directly almost within the same lane directly behind the vehicle.This could be something that seems to work for me and maybe I\\'ve been lucky to avoid any accidents involving not seeing a vehicle when changing lanes or similar maneuvers.  As pat notes I recently commented on the 4 cylinder 2.4 liter engines used in both Kia Optima and Hyundai Sonata on another topic thread in this site. My original post/reply was directed at comments by a 2007 Sonata owner who felt his car didn\\'t have enough power. He lives in western Pa which is mountainous and I noted we traveled to western Pa using rented Optima\\'s and Sonata\\'s at various times recently. Some here may remember that at the time I had sort of an informal comparison between the Optima and a Ford Fusion (both 4cyl. automatics) that I subsuquently rented after turning in the Optima.. Anyhow I commented that I felt the Optima/Sonata both felt sufficiently powerful even with 4 passengers and their luggage climbing the Allegheny mountains. Both felt, dare I say...snappy...from a dead stop. And despite all the talk about \"refinement\" when discussing engines and how Honda/Toyota have a \"lock\" on that particularly tenuous property the Hyundai 4 was just as smooth at idle (quiet too) as any Camcord I have seen. Quiet too when accelerating. The transmissions on both cars shifted smoothly and did what transmissions are designed to do..be in the right gear at the right time. I grew up during the great muscle car era and owned a few myself. I believed \"too much power is never enough\" and to this day prefer a V-6 when both a 4 along with a V-6 is offered on a particular car. Having said this some modern 4\\'s are tempting me because they are more than adaquate. I wonder if Honda in offering a 200 HP 4 cylinder for the newest Accord will prompt a 4 cylinder horsepower race??  You pretty much described exactly what I do but got it across better. And ditto on headlight glare.  I wouldn\\'t say the Accord is modeled after the 06 Sonata. I would say that the Sonata and the Accord are both chasing Camry. I believe that is why they both are and have grown so much in size. They see Camry selling a boatload(trainload, sorry they\\'re made here now) so they are being copied to someb> degree.  The accord seems to be modeled after the 2006 Sonata.I really doubt that. Although there is some resemblance to the Sonata\\'s tailights, there\\'s very little resemblance overall. Even if there were, it would be coincidental. It\\'s clear to me that Honda wanted to make the new Accord look more upscale, more like an Acura (side character line) and BMW (rear greenhouse) while meeting new regs for pedestrian safety (front end), while keeping the overall look inoffensive to most buyers (i.e., bland, because bland sells in this market).  Let me guess... you don\\'t drive in the Rust Belt, with roads that are pockmarked with potholes (some big enough to swallow a Mini Cooper) and lots of large cracks and tar strips, very often, yes?Firm ride is great on smooth, curvy roads... like those the auto mag testers frequent. Or racetracks. On the imperfect highways and byways of much of America, a too-firm ride can indeed be one man\\'s pain.  Actually design is part of engineering if you want to be specific.  There is a Mazda 6i loaded touring I wish to buy. There is $ 1750 cashback incentive. Invoice is roughly 22,103. There are also some options on the car. Destination charge is $595. It all adds up to $22,786.  Edmunds TMV is 23,121, which is a few hundred over invoice AND destination. But in the real world does not the dealer ADD destination charge to the sales price before subtracting the incentice? I ask because if that\\'s the case, would not a fair sales price be few hundered over the \"invoice.\" Thoughts?  I don\\'t see where GM designers spent more time designing the Malibu than Honda designers did with the Accord.The Malibu has a traditional 2 part grill chevy front end which looks like an bloated Cobalt. The side profile was lifted directly from TL with the rear end resembles the Mitsu Diamante. Original design? I don\\'t think so.The Honda Accord in every way resembles the 5-series (except the front, which looks Saturn to me), also not an original design.Both cars at best can only be considered as good design that\\'s easy on eyes.  The accord seems to be modeled after the 2006 Sonata.The \\'08 Accord looks nothing like the Sonata.Honda designers already admitted that they were heavily influenced by the 5-series both inside and out.  I agree, I think that link exaggerates any problems. I have also checked many times and, just as you indicate, the front of the car appears in the side mirror before the back leaves the rear view mirror. I don\\'t see a problem with needing to move my head around in parking, much rather do it in that very slow speed situation than when driving 70 mph on the freeway.Motorcycles are always going to be harder to see, no matter what you do with your mirrors. As a former rider, I was always well aware of this and spent as little time as possible next to any vehicle in a spot where I could only be seen if the person were to turn his head or look in a mirror.I do still take a look before changing lanes, I just have more confidence that I know what is around me when I can see everything at all times, without the need to turn and look. So anyway, \"blind spots\" in midsize sedans are not an issue for me  . Now, the trend toward toward super-high (and super short) trunk lids...that is one I don\\'t like. I don\\'t want to have to slide things in the trunk horizontally and the visibility when backing up is better if the trunk lid is not so high.  Thats funny because around 100-115 MPH it started to get unstable even though it was Interstate 5 and straight as an arrow. :surprise: He only had it at 113-115 MPH for a split second, and got it back down to where it wasn\\'t feeling unsafe and unstable.  No, it\\'s a combination of font size and screen resolution. The key question is did the picture widen the area where the posts appear. If it widened it more than an inch or so, a lot of people (not everyone, but don\\'t forget we have a whole lot more lurkers than we do posters) will have trouble viewing the page.A link will be fine if that\\'s what you want to do, but posting on your page would take care of it as well and you could still have the picture appear in the discussion.  Yes, I agree my 1K estimate for \"virtually no repairs\" is high. I guess I was used to my domestic vehicle that always had 2 or 3 problems by the time I took the time to take it in for service repairs every 2 to 3 months. So a broken AC might be 750 dollars, but the timing belt the compressor just burnt needing replacement pushes that up to 1,000. Anyway, I guess we can compromise and say virtually no repairs is anything under $600, and furthermore does not occur with any regular frequency (less than biannually).  Let me guess... you don\\'t drive in the Rust Belt, with roads that are pockmarked with potholes (some big enough to swallow a Mini Cooper) and lots of large cracks and tar strips, very often, yes?Michigan, actuallyFirm ride is great on smooth, curvy roads... like those the auto mag testers frequent.

On the imperfect highways and byways of much of America, a too-firm ride can indeed be one man\\'s pain.Yeah, you know I live in the same town as Car & Driver\\'s headquarters and can\\'t seem to find the beautiful roads they have in the pictures :confuse: Also, the tiny windy mountain roads on California\\'s central coast (or, as another local, Bob Seager would say, miles and miles of those twisty turny roads)where I would \"exercise\" sporting vehicles in my youth were far from smooth and flat. Some weblogue of the roads of my youth  Actually, the Classic Malibu, you know the rental fleet one, looks similar to the New Malibu. Both look OK. It was the steering, handling and drive-train which needed improvement. Did not expect any really hot styling to be done, and they didn\\'t. Just a pleasing looking car. If it is more than that, I guess one has to see it in the metal, and not just in photo. The Sonata is pretty nice looks wise, and almost performs as well as the best of the best. For its price, and when kept to retirement, it seems like a value leader. Depends how picky one is about things.L  Guess my center rear view mirror is wider. Never seen such a narrow rear view with the center mirror. I have watched for a car coming in the rear view as visible, then when it was close to disappearing, looked to the side mirror and it appears with the new method of mirror placement. Could be the wider view inside, or perhaps I am not as radical in the new view placement of the mirror, as in not moving it too far outwards. Oh well, something else for people to debate.Loren  Great! That means in over 30 years of car ownership, I\\'ve owned only one car that required repairs, \"virtually.\" It was a Honda. All the other cars I\\'ve owned--Toyotas, Mazdas, Hyundais, Nissans, Dodges, Mitsubishi, Mercury, even a Chevy Vega--required virtually no repairs.Looks like Honda is the most unreliable car on the planet, based on my long-term experience.Now perhaps we could dispense with this stuff on \"virtual\" repairs and talk more about \"concrete\" things, like the cars?  This could be the new Mitsu Galant, what do you guys think?  hmmmm.... seems to look like every other car these days.  Very 1980\\'s Japanese executive car ugly.  Thats the nice thing with nissan, no belts in any of their vehicles. One less thing to worry about, and pay to replace.  I have my doubts about Mitsubishi being around the USA much longer. I live on the Central Coast of California, a virtual import car zone, and there is not a dealership within a 135 miles of where I live. This is wrong. The dealerships can not make a go of it here, I would say elsewhere USA is doomed. They have made some interesting looking cars over the past decades, but it may soon be over. I owned a Dodge Stealth, alias Mitsubishi 3000. Seemed to me that part prices were pretty high, but perhaps it was just that new model. The car was not the same reliability as other Japan makes, at least in my case. Yes, a small sample of one. Now the car was not too expensive, really cool looking and got the most positive comments and looks from people of any car I have ever owned. It seemed pretty sturdy over all, but just short of trouble free in its life with me. A Galant, IMHO, is an interesting looking car, as it has some extra style to it. But if sales are lacking, I fear for the dealerships in America, and thus I am out where it comes to any consideration of the products. They have brought some interesting products to America over the years -- hope they can survive as a provider of cars to North American Sales. L  How do I keep my pants up. :confuse: Loren  But, the long-term reliability of Nissan\\'s CVT is still unknown. How many Murano\\'s or other Nissan products are now over 100K miles without any transmission repairs. Just wondering . . ., as I haven\\'t had a normal automatic transmission design fail at less that 165K miles.  Ummm, I see no photo. If you are talking 2008 Galant, it looks pretty good, sort of like the New Malibu. It\\'s good. When the Galant \\'08 style was a brand new style, some years back no doubt, I kinda thought it had that little something extra to it over the average mid-sized car style. Not too bad. The look still holds up well.L  Oh yeah, that\\'s a belt? Test drove a CVT. Didn\\'t do much for me, but then again I like the feel of gears kickin\\' in. The golf cart feel is something one could live with, but not live for.L  I don\\'t have links, but i\\'ve seen stuff out there showing that nissan has less warranty claims for their CVT\\'s than they had with autos. And a good deal of the ones that need fixed/replaced are because people put regualr dextron II in them. But, most of the time a CVT will be cheaper and easier to fix than a traditional auto. It just has less parts and simpler design. Thats the beuaty of them. take all those gears, gear clusters and other parts of a the auto and replace it with 2 pullies and a belt.  Its a belt, but not a toothed rubber belt like a timing belt though. and going back to the whole belt/chain thing, even though it only cost me $400 to replace the belt on my honda, once again, its $400 I didn\\'t have to spend on any of my nissans.  that puts the total money spent on the 5 year honda at $800, and a total cost of $0 for the 9yr old nissan.And there\\'s no golf cart feel on the xtronic, at least on the altima. I\\'m pretty sure the vesa and sentra have a little bit of that going on, but the altima uses a newer and better design.  I don\\'t have a problem with the timing belt on my 03 V6 Accord. When I get to 105k miles, I\\'ll change it. If you have a problem with it, don\\'t buy one. Both of my Accords have had timing belts, and they haven\\'t been a problem. I don\\'t see many other Accord owners complaining about them either. I trust Honda knows what they are doing.  so defensive, relax elroy. I never said they were bad, and even implied the replacement cost was acceptable.  Trust me, i\\'ll be complaining when that $500+ belt replacement rolls around in 3,000 miles on my 1996. Ugh... :sick:  The car back of the front end is pleasant looking, in a generic way. Quite sleek. The front end? I can imagine there are some people who think it\\'s attractive. Just not me. If it were the greatest mid-sized car available, I wouldn\\'t buy it based on that front-end alone. I call that the \"Aztec Factor\" in my car buying process.  This looks like a blend between Mercury Montego and Mercedes S-Class  Well I didn\\'t care for the CVT tranny, and the emergency brake placement looked to me closer to where I would expect a clutch to be only higher up. Wonder if it comes in contact with the legs in an accident. Hate those foot brakes for the emergency brake. The push button starter was kinda a cute like thing. Overall, it did not feel as solid and quiet built to me as did the Accord and Aura when test driven. To each his own, I guess. The looks of the car is great. And the power is great for the i4 engine. I see you have a Nissan of nine years without any repairs needed. That is a record, and I bet you are happy indeed with that - I would be. My Dad had a \\'91 Camry that way. Never a day back at the dealership. Those are rare finds, even in the Japanese car lines. While $800 in five years is money spent, it pales in comparison to the days of domestics woes in the 70\\'s, 80\\'s and even the 90\\'s where in three to five years some cars were ready to be retired. Trust me, been there, had it happen. And in nine years, I would be surprised to see them in any shape at all which I would feel comfortable driving one more than a across town.L  I have to agree with you, the emergency brake is in about the worst place possible. I can\\'t help but wonder what they were thinking with that.And yea, I know there is some luck involved with 9 years and no repairs. But I still think its a minimal amount of luck. I\\'ve always contributed the longevity of my vehicles more to the fact I take very good care of them than anything else. The honda has been just as good. Most of the 800 was for the timing belt, which is maintanence, not repair. So, Its more like $300 over 5 years. Thats why I always qualified my posts with winks, or intentional statements that the bill was small or expected. Just tounge in cheek humor. The timing belt is a great example. Even though it cost 400 or so to replace, i don\\'t mind because it does have an advantage over the chain. If the chain in either of my nissans should go, and both being DOHC engines, I\\'d be lucky to get it fixed for less than 1500. looking at it that way, the 400 once, twice, maybe three times over the life of the car ain\\'t so bad. :P  No, destination should be included in the sales price you pay.  have my doubts about Mitsubishi being around the USA much longer. I live on the Central Coast of California, a virtual import car zone, and there is not a dealership within a 135 miles of where I live.The ones in SLO, Santa Maria, and Ventura/Oxnard don\\'t count?  None in Santa Maria, and None in San Luis Obispo. There was one for a brief couple of years in Atascadero. Yes, there is one in Oxnard. This means they are likely on the way out. That is the way I view it anyway. I guess Mitsubishi could run their own dealerships or something. There may be a dealership in Seaside too. Alas, all too few for an import kinda state, I\\'d say. If there are listings for San Luis Obispo, those date back over two years ago, as does any listing for Santa Maria, as in Ford and Mitsubishi. Let\\'s see, it was Valley Mazda in SLO and they are gone completely -- Mitsubishi is gone due to no sales and later on the Mazda closed when the owner retired. Oxnard? Is that Todey\\'s or Toady\\'s or something like that? I\\'ve been there some years ago. L  Nope - \\'fraid not. I worked for GM for 9 years, and, drove Olds for years until they became clone cars. My son drives a restored 1968 Olds Cutlass convertible with a 425 Olds big block in it.Regards:Oldengineer  Depends on where you live I geuss... in my area, it\\'s not uncommon for the Mazda6 to be advertised for 5 or 6k off of msrp after all rebates. I\\'ve actually seen them go as low as 7k off! If you can wait until fall (like near thanksgiving) when car sales typically fall off, you can probably get an even better deal. But regardless, with all the concern about the economy b/c of the mortgage issues, car sales have not been all that great which should be an advantage for you. Go to the library on a Sat or Sunday and check out all the newspapers within a 150 mile area, photocopy the best ones and take it to your dealership. Mazda also has a way to check inventory in your area, so send emails to their sales dept and see what kind of deals you can get that way. Regardless good luck and do not be intimidated! You\\'ve got the money that they want...  If not for the truck-like grill, that Galant would look pretty good to me. As someone else said, I\\'m sure it will appeal to some...just as the Chysler 300, with it\\'s truck-like grill does.  My car\\'s in the shop right now, and I\\'ll probably pay almost $500 for a 90K mile service consisting of flushing fluids and staring at lots of parts. If that\\'s the scale these days, then $1K probably isn\\'t a difficult repair cost threshold to meet.I\\'m speculating...I drive an Accord, so I don\\'t actually know what repairs cost. :P (KIDDING, just had to throw that in)  Metal suspenders? (Timing chain type)   Looks \"pissed off\" in the front clip--road rage anyone?-- but a definite improvement on the present somewhat disjointed platform. I had a number of Mitsu/Chrysler captive imports in the seventies and eighties (remember the Arrow?) that I rather liked. Would like to see Mitsubishi come back but they need to refine their business plan. Existing cars seem to really come up short in interior fit and finish, not only to the front-line Japanese cars but to the Koreans as well.  I drive an Accord, so I don\\'t actually know what repairs cost.That\\'s cuz they put everything into the maintenance schedule...90K mi maintenance: rebuild engine, replace transmission, ... But, seriously as someone else had mentioned an example is timing belt...replacement is maintenance on an Accord, but a repair on Ford\\'s 2.0 Zetec engine in the Contour, etc.  The family car was the \\'68 Cutlass way back when, then replaced with the \\'72 Cutlass -- very nice looking car. Sorry, but Olds. kinda lost it after the early 70\\'s and was not so hot late 70\\'s on. That said, a last of Cutlass 442 would be nice to have. The classic look of \\'68 was that Toronado. Most of the FWD stuff from GM though is lacking for around three decades. Looks wise, the last Aurora is pretty sharp, and better looking than the current Impala. And yes, I agree the clone car era is pretty sad. Or are we still in the clone era? Oh well, parts is parts. L  I have owned 4 Nissans in the past 18 years with 3 of them using timing belts and never had any problems with the timing belts. Cost of replacement was not a problem since I did the replacement myself(More a pain of taking up time I could be doing something else).A couple months after I bought my 2002 Maxima a friend had the timing chain tensioner break on his 1998 Maxima leading to a costly repair. The car had a little over 60000 miles on it and was out of warranty. Neither system is foolproof but belts tend to be quieter and cheaper to build. All things considered I would rather have a chain simply since I usually keep my cars for a long time and it is 1 less maintainence item to deal with, although a chain can stretch and need replacement after many years of use.  That Contour reminds me of my first new car, an Opel Manta Rallye. Well, with a couple extra doors on it, I may add. As I recall the crash testing did not go well for that car. Then the car sales crashed. It just never flew. I wish they would make another car sort of like that Opel I had. Nice little coupe. Today one has a mostly choices of designs which look similar to each other, with too tall doors, and huge headlamps, which evidently is the replacement for chrome and other accents of the cars of yesteryears. I suspect within the decades time, new car door will no longer use windows, and you will peer through a submarine scope to see around. And those trunks will be up to roof top heights, so in a way the station wagon returns :P I ended up getting an Accord \\'07, which may be the last of the reasonable ( a little big ) sized Accords, with tall, but not as tall doors, with large 17\" wheels, but not wagon wheel sized, and a bit large eyes, yet not overtaking the entire front just yet, car! When I decide to change this car for something else some day, perhaps it will have to be used. I mean enough already with the little windows and big butts on cars. Those 17\" wheels cost enough to replace, I am not looking for a 20\" wheel car some day. As for maintenance, like radiator flush and such, I would take it to an independent which charges much less than the dealership or those specialty experts for Imports, which translates into, let\\'s double the price. A neighbor took a rock in his Volvo headlamp. They replaced the whole thing at something like $450. Dang, that use to be an engine overhaul  And you can still get a GM 350 engine for what, say $1,750? This was just a crack on the headlamp, not a major incident. Wonder what Volvo charges for a $30 oil change -- $60 - $80 ??? Just nuts.L  I can remember when you could buy one rectangular sealed halogen headlight, and it would fit either your car, or your truck. Those days are long gone, never to return. Now each car has it\\'s own special headlight design   I can remember when you could buy one rectangular sealed halogen headlight, and it would fit either your car, or your truck. Those days are long gone, never to return. Now each car has it\\'s own special headlight designI have yet to have to replace a lamp assembly on a modern vehicle. Most of those vehicles used a very standardized, very easy to find 9006 bulb, which I have had to replace on every vehicle I\\'ve had. The outside housing might be special but the bulb inside is a standard (I know, HID bulbs are different, but that whole system is different).  $200 to $400 when ya do have to replace the headlights. How about those yellowing or white headlamp covers. I wonder how many can be sanded or polished out to look clear again, or are they just a goner?What is really interesting is the return of the round. I think we will see this on some retro theme cars. And, call me crazy, some cars just look so good with a simple round headlamp, you wonder if they are just trying too hard these days to bling. Those small round lamps, I take it, did not work out so well for the Integra Acuras?L  If GM comes out with a RWD Pontiac G6 (hopefully will have found a name some day) would you consider it? Will GM ever have a RWD car of similar size of the Epsilon platform? Seems like the last poor-man\\'s RWD car with a four cylinder or a V6 died with the last 240SX Nissan sold in USA. You can buy a Miata or Solstice/Sky, but nothing larger in RWD until you get into the big bucks, as in BMW3. The CTS appears to be as costly now as a Bimmer 3. Would there not be some real demand for RWD cars, which handle well, in the sub $25K range? Would it really cost all that much more? Was there not a time when all domestic cars had RWD? How about a nice little Nova RWD, with some handling to it?I don\\'t care if a car holds four pieces of luggage, instead of six, or it can in theory seat five, when they really carry four. Heck, give me two doors instead of four, or make both models, just get back to some good old fashion style and handling cars which can spin the rears! :shades: Loren  A water pump is not mechanical? It is software perhaps?So he has only 6 years and 122k miles to go to make it to that magic 300k and 20 years with virtually no repairs. Good luck to him!Wow, does someone have a chip on their shoulders. Looks like there are alot replies since I posted and I\\'m sure someone likely has stated it. The water pump DID NOT need to be replaced. It\\'s just makes sense and is usually much cheaper to get it replaced during the timing belt change. Who knows how long it would have lasted. If you\\'ve read my post. My 64 year old father is not looking to go to 300K. He\\'s just aiming to get to 200K w/o any mechanical breakdowns as you asked prior if anyone knew of someone with alot of mileage with little to no unscheduled mechanical repairs. Everything I listed fit your request other than the 20 year/300K, which I stated at the beginning of my response that it was 16 years old and nearing 200K. Not to take a shot at ya, but maybe you should educate yourself with what\\'s usually scheduled vs unscheduled repairs.Take it easy bub. It\\'s just car talk. Sorry you had a such a negative experience with whatever make and models you\\'ve owned.  What? Do you live in a different world?Every manufacturer has a destination charge. The destination charge is a straight pass through with no mark-up for he dealer. It IS a cost of the car. Since the manufacuters set a flat rate destination charge years ago, they could have built destination into the invoice price, but they chose not to, presumably so they could advertise a lower price. If you look at an MSRP sitcker, you will see the the total MSRP includes a destination charge.  You didn\\'t say you replaced the water pump proactively, until now. You did say the car had no mechanical repairs, then said the water pump was replaced. Those two things didn\\'t seem to sync, without the additional information you just provided. And the comment about the 6 more years to go etc. was not aimed at you. Sorry if you were offended by that.As for my negative experiences, as I noted earlier, the only car I\\'ve owned in over 30 years that did not fit the \"virtually no repairs\" rule was a Honda. But I still like Hondas. I just don\\'t like what they cost relative to other alternatives.  If GM comes out with a RWD Pontiac G6 (hopefully will have found a name some day) would you consider it? No, I would not consider any RWD car. It is just much easier to have FWD, when you live where there is winter.Would there not be some real demand for RWD cars,Not from me, and I am guessing there would be little demand in the snow belt. I don\\'t feel it is needed, but most people around here love AWD/4WD.  an Opel Manta Rallye........wish they would make another car sort of like that Opel I had.a man with some taste! had one myself - and ran autocross with it! Opels got a bad name from some 1100cc tin cans (which I also owned) and by the time they got around (72?)to the 1900 (and a tight handling good lookingt sedan) you are talking about. Buick couldnt sell enough of them and as Opel prices went up and up becuase of the mark to dollar exchange rate were forced then to source the car out of Japan (Isuzu?) by the mid 70s - which were even worse POSs than even the Toyotas and Datsuns (Nissans) of he mid and late 60s.Opel is still a respected brand in Europe, and has the best selling car over there, the upcoming replacement for the Saturn Ion is that car - unfortunately saddled with the Ecotec 4). We also owe the Aura and the CTS to some of that German engineering. Headlights- here\\'s one for you - own a HID equipped Avalon, got into a really minor fender bender, headlight lense had a scratch in it - headlight only available as an \\'assembly\\' - cost to replace $1100.00 plus labor!  I believe it was noted previouisly that we should expect 270 HP from the new Mazda6 3.7L V6. See below. Should be quite a performer if it is in fact lighter than the previousl gen. Depending on torque, I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see high 5s in the 0-60 test if all else holds true. Base engine: 2.5l I4 - 190-200hpOptional Engine: 3.7l PFI V6 - 280hp AWD optional  My original post/reply was directed at comments by a 2007 Sonata owner who felt his car didn\\'t have enough power. He lives in western Pa which is mountainous and I noted we traveled to western Pa using rented Optima\\'s and Sonata\\'s at various times recently. Some here may remember that at the time I had sort of an informal comparison between the Optima and a Ford Fusion (both 4cyl. automatics) that I subsuquently rented after turning in the Optima.. Anyhow I commented that I felt the Optima/Sonata both felt sufficiently powerful even with 4 passengers and their luggage climbing the Allegheny mountains. Both felt, dare I say...snappy...from a dead stop. I too live in Western PA and agree that it probably felt snappy on the highways as pretty much anything built after MY2000 will. However, I would argue that it felt snappy if you tried starting off on one of our many very steep hills that have either stop signs or stop lights in the middle of them. Chevrolet is the #1 selling brand in the Pittsburgh area mostly, and this is IMO, due to the availability of a V6 in almost everything they sell. Lots of Impalas and Montes around here. I myself always opt for at least a V6 anymore after thoroughly struggling with a Civic and ZX2 on the hills for a few years. Not much choice in that class though. I just got back from the OBX today and did notice an Optima or two (may have been the same one, both I4s) flying by on the PA turnpike. They looked perfectly at home at a high speed and I have no doubt they are perfectly adequate for most people. I am not one of them due to the area in which I live however.  Have an 07 Optima and an 05 Maxx. The Optima kicks from fifth all the way down to third on lots of grades. The Maxx gets slightly better mileage even with the four speed and 3.5 V-6. The Optima is considerably smoother, however. Hyunkia engines are notoriously tight and my suspicion is things will get better than 30 on the highway once things loosen up--5000 on my wife\\'s car right now.If you can stand the high rpm\\'s on grades the Optima does have adequate power. If I use the manual shift, it doesn\\'t kick down and still seems to make grades-- the Ozarks aren\\'t the Allegheny\\'s however.  as someone else had mentioned an example is timing belt...replacement is maintenance on an Accord, but a repair on Ford\\'s 2.0 Zetec engine in the Contour, etc.That\\'s a fair point, but I\\'m willing to pay a certain amount for regular service that avoids future roadside situations. The avoidance of unanticipated disruptions is worth some extra money.I do have to wonder, though, to what extent the recommended maintenance periods are based on actual need vs. being a profit center for the dealerships\\' service areas. The 90K check was invoiced at 5 labor hours, cost ~$500, and the list of what they actually did isn\\'t that long...lots of \"inspect this, check that.\" Plus, it was out in less than 3 hours...did they really have multiple people working on it? I had it done to protect my extended warranty, but I\\'ll be very tempted to cut back on the full packages once that\\'s no longer an issue.What do you guys do for service: follow the recommendations or pick and choose? Do you handle older cars differently than newer ones?  Chevrolet is the #1 selling brand in the Pittsburgh area mostly, and this is IMO, due to the availability of a V6 in almost everything they sell. Lots of Impalas and Montes around here. I myself always opt for at least a V6 anymore after thoroughly struggling with a Civic and ZX2 on the hills for a few years.I live in Southern California which has mountains all over the place (a lot bigger than in Pittsburgh). The CITY of Los Angeles has numerous passes and hills. There are plenty of Civics, Corollas, and Mazda 3\\'s here.I suspect the Pittsburgh story is more that it\\'s in the traditional midwest rust belt and people just buy more American Cars. (Not slamming Pittsburgh, I\\'ve been there many times and it is a beautiful city in its hill and river setting.)  But, seriously as someone else had mentioned an example is timing belt...replacement is maintenance on an Accord, but a repair on Ford\\'s 2.0 Zetec engine in the Contour, etc. It doesn\\'t really matter if you call it maintenance or a repair, warranty is not going to cover either one. But if Ford does not have a set time to change the timing belt, is it supposed to last the life of the engine? I guess Ford thinks other engine parts are likely to fail before the belt.  $1,100 + labor for a headlamp? Around \\'70 or maybe it was \\'71, I bought a used Mustang 289 for that -- yeap, it was $1,100. Of course the brand new Opel Manta Rallye was but $3,150 out the door price! Things have sure changed. I got a bad engine in my Opel, or I would have kept it longer. And a warranty in those days was 12 months, i think. Always thought the Datsun 510\\'s to be a bargain. Owned a used one back in say \\'82-\\'83-maybe into \\'84 which was perhaps a couple years old car when purchased, and traded it in for a loss of $800 in two or was it two and a half years. Of course the Mustang I bought new ended up in the repair shop, at which point I kicked myself for turning in the trouble free car. But alas, those 510\\'s had such thin steel, they did not seem too safe, and they made the seats flat, so the buns went numb on longer trips. I have seen the new baby Volvo, which is very nice little thing. This one happens to be something like $27K, which is so over the top price wise. Isn\\'t the new Astra something like $16K? I can possibly see it as $21K base then $23K loaded, but that is a stretch. Looks like a neat little skateboard, many I think will see it as an $18K to $21K car, even with all that HP. Or is that HP all so much fun for the little guy, it is worth the price? Guess the numbers sold will tell the tale. - L  All this fancy technology permeating all new cars means one thing when replacement is necessary: big time money. Has anyone priced the OEM catalytic converter that\\'s part of the exhaust manifold down pipe that most new cars have? Mucho more expensive that the separate CAT that was downstream in the exhaust system. Over on the Honda Accord boards, everyone is beating the \"LED Tail Light\" drum - what until you have to replace those! (Yes, LEDs do burn out). Give me an old-fashioned round halogen incandescent headlight that you can replace for $7, and a standard lamp for the tail light any day. Let\\'s face it, progress, and cutting-edge technology, equate to much higher repair costs.  I live in Southern California which has mountains all over the place (a lot bigger than in Pittsburgh). The CITY of Los Angeles has numerous passes and hills. There are plenty of Civics, Corollas, and Mazda 3\\'s here. I suspect the Pittsburgh story is more that it\\'s in the traditional midwest rust belt and people just buy more American Cars. (Not slamming Pittsburgh, I\\'ve been there many times and it is a beautiful city in its hill and river setting.) There are a lot of small cars here too because those hills make the gas disappear faster as you well know. I think the tendency towards the larger Chevys though is, like I said, the readily available V6, and the weight. The heavier cars tend to do better in the snow (maybe not for stopping though :surprise: ) plus you need something big to take tailgaiting when the Steelers are in town.   LED are bright, illuminate faster, and should last ten years,or more. Looks OK to me. Yeah, lots of things in my new car look like expensive repairs some day. If I keep it longer than power-train period, say as a 7 to 10 yr car, perhaps it may be the first time I ever buy a warranty. Still thinking of buying a bit more simple car next time - something of a modern day classic perhaps, just pre-highest tech period. Just thinking about that. Right not, as in the next car purchase may be the sports car.At one time I was considering a larger car than my Accord for the everyday car. I am now of the belief this \\'07 is large, as in large enough, and the next full time car will be no larger or smaller. Small is just so user friendly in all so many ways. As for high tech items which are a bit of a thorn with me, right now I am thinking those thick A pillars for the air bags. So far, anti-lock brakes, stability control, and the rest seem like a good thing, though replacing / repairing is not gonna be all that cheap no doubt. I still kinda miss seeing a hood out front. Today\\'s cars seem to have little to no visible hood out there. This is one thing I would look for in finding a modern day classic. Oh yeah, another thing is a good old fashion key instead of those $200 + keys.All in all though, the modern day car has safety, speed, gas mileage, ride, cornering, comfort and the like, which exceeds just about anything made before it. Not to say I don\\'t appreciate the simple life. My Corolla and Miata had roll up windows, and manual door locks, so how simple is that. A key for those two, cost under a $1. each.You pay to play, as the gals in Vegas say. :shades: And modern has its play for more pay benefits.L  If you can stand the high rpm\\'s on grades the Optima does have adequate power.That\\'s the part I hate. The Civic we had needed wound so high on the hills that I got dirty looks because it sounded like I was going too fast. I haven\\'t driven a Honda lately but I understand they\\'ve alleviated some of that need for high RPM to produce the modest amount of power it takes to get you up hills and grades. It sounds like you are telling me Hyunkia hasn\\'t come that far yet?  It doesn\\'t really matter if you call it maintenance or a repair... No, it really doesn\\'t...except for \"talk\" here and it also might matter on things like CR surveys.But if Ford does not have a set time to change the timing belt, is it supposed to last the life of the engine? Yes, \"life of the engine\" is what they said when I asked. I believe typically they would last over 100,000 miles. It was not an interference engine, so you could choose to leave it until it breaks or treat it as a maintenance item and replace it proactively.  Ah, the sweet sounds of a smooth running, high revving engine = no problem. Some old thrashing i4, or V6 engine, is pretty bad. For those not loving the sound of an engine, the old OHC engines of the domestics is the better choice, with torque and HP at lower RPM. Some of those once up in the higher speeds though, as in near the top of the revvs just sound too thrashy to me. L  What do you guys do for service: follow the recommendations or pick and choose? I follow the manufacturer\\'s schedule not the dealers recomendations. I never ask for things like \"90,000 mile service\"...well, I did make that mistake once.  Some of those once up in the higher speeds though, as in near the top of the revvs just sound too thrashy to me.Ah, but since the power comes in at a much lower RPM you don\\'t have to wind it up. Our Explorer sounds awful when revved high but I think I\\'ve had to do that maybe twice in the year and a half we\\'ve owned it. All the power is down low and you move without drama.The Mazda6 S I had did need some fairly high revs to get going at a reasonable pace but it was much better than the I4 version of anything I can think of IMO.  LED are bright, illuminate faster, and should last ten years,or more. Looks OK to me.And that entire array consumes considerably less energy than a bulb (especially of similar brightness). This means fewer and smaller wires running to the back of the car, which means cheaper, lighter and easier to build assemblies. It also means a lighter vehicle (you wouldn\\'t believe how much a fully dressed wire harness weighs) and better mpg.  I think you were trying to reply to me and not yourself? Anyway, my post was not talking about destination charges at all but was more about what the OP should be looking to pay for a Mazda6 based on what discounts I\\'m seeing in my area.I suppose all costs that a dealership puts on a car are negotiable, but how much wiggle room there is in destination charges is a complete mystery to me. Sounds like the car companies would prefer it that way too. Personally, my negotiations circled around the discount off of MSRP and not about dealer documentation fees or destination charges. Sorry for the confusion and I\\'ll be going back to my world now.  You seem to move well enough until up in the high speeds, when asked to pass. It is then where the SOHC or DOHC seem to shine. That said, they both have their good side to them. Not everyone will enjoy hearing a higher revved up engine. And there is limits to everything no doubt. You would not want to have to max the engine every time just to move across town. It had been some time, say around a decade of i4 engines for me, but I am back to a V6 again. Really do enjoy the extra power, and it comes in for safety in some cases when entering freeways, which seem more and more crowded these days here in California. There is just something smooth too about the not having to really work to get things going. I tell ya, the PT Cruiser it is really revving up the i4 and rowing the gears just at the right time, if you want to get anywhere in less than a snails pace. This is not to say I am not going to consider another i4 with a stick, and be doing the clutch and stick routine again, as another sports car is a possible in the near future. As for another sedan, one fine day, I guess it depends on how the cost of gasoline goes. They keep upping the HP for the i4 engines, so they are closing in on the at least the older V6 engines. Believe it or not, my current 244HP V6 is the most HP I have ever had, including the early 70\\'s with my Mustang 289 at what, say 200HP? So this time I just thought I would go for the power. It\\'s all good though, be it 100HP little i4 or having a 430HP Corvette, as it is the car in total which makes the difference. Those, less than powerful little Miatas can be a kick to drive. It\\'s all good - just enjoy the drive! L  I have never driven the AWD cars. Seems like they all would be good for snow conditions. But then again, I rarely am faced with snow, other than a once in a blue moon during a vacation or two. Got caught in snow coming back to CA from Las Vegas. I had a FWD Achieva, with new tires, and it did well indeed. There was enough snow, they closed the freeway at Baker that day, minutes after I reached the town. So I guess the FWD was a good thing. Nowadays, the computers can help sort things out though to keep you moving and upright, so I guess it is slightly less an issue. And wouldn\\'t the 50/50 weight distribution be better in some cases, even in snow travel ? I can see most premium cars moving to RWD / AWD. I take most AWD cars like the Subarus are mostly FWD driving the wheels, with the occasional kicking in of power to the rear, or what 15% ? Never really researched the AWD cars based on FWD, as it doesn\\'t seem an issue on the left coast USA. I do know that many Subaru owners seem to be fans of the cars, somewhat like those SAAB owners. Is this a cult car? Loren  I have never driven the AWD cars.Me neither, except for a test drive of a legacy. The salesperson wanted to show off the AWD, had me accelerate with two wheels on snow/ice and two on pavement. It did fine, but then I later tried the same thing with my wife\\'s jetta that has ESC and it did just fine too. I think subaru is full-time AWD and it\\'s the Volvo system (also used by Ford) that just occassionally sends power to rear. I also have not driven a RWD car at all since about 1985 and that was a 1977 model. I suppose things may have changed a bit in 30 years  . I had a Ford salesman one time telling me the mustang would be fine in winter as long as you get traction control, never tested that claim though as I decided it was too impractical anyway. I guess if you got ESC in a RWD, that\\'d probably do just fine in winter. Also I\\'m sure real snow tires can help a lot, but I would not want the bother of tire switching twice a year. Since things get plowed and salted quickly all season tires and FWD work good enough to suit me 99% of the time.  >Over on the Honda Accord boards, everyone is beating the \"LED Tail Light\" drum The LEDs look like a connect-the-dot puzzle and that they were too cheap to fill in with enough dots of light to give a full, bright display. Check the Cadillac DTS and STS taillights. Those are LEDs. Gimme full taillights.  >This means fewer and smaller wires running to the back of the car, which means cheaper, lighter and easier to build assembliesAre you sure about the wiring? I\\'ll check a wiring diagram but I see one wire for running lights, one wire each for left and right turn signal capability, and then a ground. I doubt the wire size is different on the Accord, e.g., nor fewer in number. As for the cheaper I suspect LEDs cost more and the weight of the taillight assembly would be the same.  You would be correct, LED\\' are much more expensive to use. unlike a conventionl light, it doesn\\'t use a signle bulb. I had a thrid brake light in the spoiler of a car that had a few of the small LED\\'s burn out. the whole piece had to be replaced, and I want to say it ran a little over $100  >This means fewer and smaller wires running to the back of the car, which means cheaper, lighter and easier to build assembliesAre you sure about the wiring?

I doubt the wire size is different on the Accord, e.g., nor fewer in number. As for the cheaper I suspect LEDs cost more and the weight of the taillight assembly would be the same.The wire gauge is smaller, LEDs us much less current than a bulb, and the in-rush current is low to non-existent (the part where it pulls enough current to get the thing to start to glow). Believe me, they will run a smaller gauge wire if they can, especially now. Copper prices had a really rough year.Also, when the lights are more efficient it means you can use a smaller battery and alternator, and they need to work less of the time, freeing up weight from the battery and horsepower from the alternator.  >when the lights are more efficient it means you can use a smaller battery and alternator, and they need to work less of the time, freeing up weight from the battery and horsepower from the alternator. Can you edify me about how much of a reduced current load occurs from a fully-populated LED array of taillights, ala DTS/STS vs a 1056 tungsten bulb (whatever the right number :blush: )? The brake lights work only a tiny fraction of the time the lights are on. The running taillights are only on at dusk to dawn; that\\'s a tiny percentage for most drivers out of the total time driven. I have trouble believing it\\'s a meaningful reduction in load for the battery. Now if all bulbs on the car became LEDS including headlights I could believe there\\'s a meaningful/measurable reduction.  As you can see, over 2 amps is pulled by the regular bulbs. Less than 1/8 of that power draw is pulled by the LED&#146;s. Even more shocking is the actual brake circuit of the 1157 bulbs (not listed in the table). Each bulb pulls 2.08A when braking, while the LED&#146;s pull 0.12A. In this case, the regular bulb pulls 17 times as much current as the LED. Regular to LED Power SavingsSome caveats - the tests were done a vehicle not designed for LED lighting, he talks only about steady-state measurements, and he doesn\\'t list the specification of the LEDs he is using. He also says something about the brightness, which is odd since there is a FMVSS standard for the output. I know the housings for LED lamps are different than those for incandescent, and since he was retro-fitting perhaps that was his issue. I find the brakelights on the Caddy and the G35 to be brighter than those on their non-LED counterparts.As far as replacing all vehicle lighting with LEDs, its on its way. Trailer lights have gone to LED to reduce the load on the towing vehicle\\'s electrical system, etc.  Ah one of those people with enough lights on the Christmas tree to break the branches.  The Accord has enough bulbs, and it looks fine.Never liked the STS in the latest form. Just looks like they took CTS stretched it out, then took out the best of the character style, and left it as a larger and blander looking CTS, at a much higher price. Yuk!The DTS redo is kinda interesting. Not sure it is better, but it is different. I liked that Euro, more minimal and smooth style to the predecessor. Since Mr. D has the Euro lettering and is now nameless, why did they not keep the Euro look? Someone is confused. Oh well, bling is in. L  I heard Santa Claus was considering replacing Rudolph this coming foggy Christmas eve, with LED lights. Perhaps it is only a rumor. L  \"I take most AWD cars like the Subarus are mostly FWD driving the wheels, with the occasional kicking in of power to the rear, or what 15% ?\"To set the record straight at least on my Subie it is full-time AWD. When accelerating from a dead stop the rear wheels have the torque, while accelerating torque shifts to the front-wheels and eventually settles in to a front to rear ratio.My Subie has an LSD for the rear diff. Slippage will shift torque left to right and then to the front if needed. The Subie AWD automatically adjusts front to rear ratios as needed.The above information is from owners manual.This doesn\\'t apply to the STI.Here is a link that talks about part of the story.http://www.autoworld.com/news/Subaru/Subaru_All-Wheel.htm  Olds actually lost it in 1977 when they started putting Chevy 350\\'s in the B bodies instead of the Olds Rocket engines. My last Olds was a 1978 Custom Cruiser 9 passenger wagon - needed it to haul around the growing family. However, with the help of a friendly dealer, I ordered it with the high altitude package - which equipped it with the Olds 403 CID engine and stronger tranny. I also equipped it with the F41 suspension, positraction, and the biggest wheel option available. I basically had a 9 passenger police car, and, it was the ultimate sleeper.Regards:OldCEM  Well my \\'76 Starfire was no great work of automotive engineering. :P But I had fun with it, drove it I guess it was maybe six to seven years, then sold it as junk for $299 wholesaler. No one wanted to buy it. Wasn\\'t high mileage or anything, just unwanted and it looked a bit tired. Bought a used Datusn 510 which ran great and looked A-OK, without parts falling off. Replaces a headlamp $17 and a hood prop clip for something like 50 cents a pair, and an inline fuse $1, but it took an hours labor to find the problem, as I had made the mistake of not going to a dealer and went to a service station for the repair. Anyway, not bad for a used car over a 2 1/2 years of service. Only lost $800 when I traded the car in. Dad then bought the next Olds, a station wagon, V8 with all of 140HP, I think it was for 1984. Not a great car, but it ran. His next car was a Camry, which he really liked. This car was impressive with zero defects in 9 years of service.Fast forward to today, GM has some better stuff to sell no doubt, but I am wondering how they are going to sell cars like the Epsilon series as being somehow all that better than buying a brand X. What is to set them apart from the rest. Way back when, one could argue that gee that new Datsun 510 say in 1968 sure has some features and gas mileage, but look we have this better styled car, with more steel and wouldn\\'t it be more comfortable and safer than your 510. Or you could say, we have nicer seating, or more dealerships, and well you get the point. What now is the main selling point for GM, and Ford if the car is a much the same as car? How would you market the car. I see GM likes the All American Theme. But the old cars looked so much different than did the competition. You had a VW bug, a Subaru lighter steel little egg thing, a Honda with paper thin doors, and well some really lightweight contenders. I think back then, I would be more stylin\\' in a Chevy Nova II or a Falcon, or Fairlane 500. Will there be any attempts at style for cars in the mid-size or smaller? L  I saw the Accord on Motorweek and it looked better on TV than in pics. That said, the rear end is terribly unattractive and the car is more inoffensive than good looking. Its not ugly by any means, but they could\\'ve done better.  http://www.hondanews.com/categories/1097/releases/4192  However, with the help of a friendly dealer, I ordered it with the high altitude package - which equipped it with the Olds 403 CID engine and stronger tranny. I also equipped it with the F41 suspension, positraction, and the biggest wheel option available.\"Special Packages\" like the \"heavy duty,\" \"high altitude,\" and fleet packages are kind of the way to go with the full size domestic vehicles. My folks \\'89 Grand Voyager had the $400 tow package which got them much larger front and rear brakes, larger tires and wheels, a real spare, a large auxiliary radiator and trans cooler, and heavy duty suspension with a higher payload.I think that did a lot to help that vehicle, as the transmission was fine, it never had a brake problem (their friends were having warped rotor issues) and the cooling system was great (there was a head gasket problem on some of their friend\\'s vans). Of course, it should\\'ve been standard, apparently, but oh well.  I agree. Things are different in Pittsburgh as opposed to SoCal. A house here in nice neighborhood will cost you well less that 200,000. There are a lot of, mostly older, Pittburghers that only buy American. The fact that domestics are much cheaper than Hondas is a bonus or maybe the reason for American made preference. Then again, in my Pittburgh neighborhood I rarely see v4 Accords but I see plenty of V6 Accords.  Prices are relatively unchanged! My 2006 EX 4-cyl (cloth, Auto), stickered for $23,800. The new 2008 model is $23,860, for reference.  Honda has really increased the pressure on the competition with the pricing of the 2008.Sorry Malibu!  Don\\'t look for Chevrolet to be out-priced. Most GM vehicles have a very solid history of having cash on the hood of every car they sell. It has happened so much, people now expect it.  \"Actually, the Classic Malibu, you know the rental fleet one, looks similar to the New Malibu. Both look OK. It was the steering, handling and drive-train which needed improvement. Did not expect any really hot styling to be done, and they didn\\'t. Just a pleasing looking car. If it is more than that, I guess one has to see it in the metal, and not just in photo. \"The two cars look nothing alike. They dont even have the same overall profile or dimensions. As for the steering, the Malibu has electric steering on all but the SS model. The new car has hydraulic steering on V6 models just like the Aura/G6. The electric steering is the one that got a lot of criticism. I have seen the new Malibu in the flesh, it looks good in person. Better than in pics. and the pics arent too bad themselves.  They mainly put the pressure on Camry and Altima. The new Accord makes the camry look even more overpriced than it does now. The Altima also seems too expensive now. The Malibu is right in this same range. A Malibu LTZ with every option should be around $28k. The base Malibu starts at $20K + destination which is about $1000 less than 2008 Accord LX with 5 speed auto. A camry equipped like the Accord EX-L V6 model is probably around $34k. Way too much money for a Camry.  Is is just me or is Honda charging about $2200 for the V6 engine? That seems a little ridiculous to me in spite of the 268hp available.   Yeah, I think they are charging about 2k more for the cylinder engine. It probably costs about that much more to make the 3.5 with VCM than the 2.4&#151;which is already a great and quite sophisticated engine.  Honda\\'s prices seem high to me. Then again, they always have. That being said, our 2007 3.0-liter V6 AWD SEL Ford Fusion with moon roof, heated leather seats and ABS had a MSRP of $27,105, that\\'s without Sirius radio, without navigation and without the eight-speaker Audiophile radio system.My wife and I love almost everything about the Fusion except for its horrific 14.8 mpg in all-city driving. The revised EPA estimate for this power train combination is 17 mpg city; 24 mpg highway.Boz  My wife and I love almost everything about the Fusion except for its horrific 14.8 mpg in all-city driving. The revised EPA estimate for this power train combination is 17 mpg city; 24 mpg highway.Go rent an Accord for a week. Record your mileage under your actual driving conditions. Then see you will have a basis for comparison.Also, while the fuel economy is poor, given the number of miles traveled, it sounds like the financial impact is negligible.  I have an \\'07 Accord SE V6 cost around $22,500 and gets about 20 MPG around town, usually 24 MPG in mixed driving, or most highway with rabbit starts, and 29MPG for freeway cruising. Not bad for 244HP.Never understood the moonroof thing. With an Accord it would mean a loss of over 2\" headroom for something I would be using anyway. Now a convertible hardtop may be a neat item. :shades: Navigation is not needed, as I am never lost. Have taken a couple of interesting side trips along the way however. If I was a salesman on the road, then yes - navigation system. AAA gives me those neat maps -- good reading. As for Sirius radio, I don\\'t need that. I listen to free radio some of the time to see what is playing or what they are talking about in the area I am at, then I have the 6 CD changer for music. CDs are getting cheap. The good music is cheaper, as you find the old names in rock and such for a better price, instead of the current pop tart trash and rap bad poetry. Never owned leather seats. They look kinda neat, I guess. Maybe I will on a sports car some day.

But for the love of whoever, put in a decent iPod interface. As the cost of a navigation system drops, they will become more and more appealing. Add in real time traffic information and dynamic routing and you are starting to look pretty convincing.  As has been pointed out many times, your \"horrific\" mpg has little to do with the Fusion and much to do with how and where you dirve it.  interesting reading - the comparo won by a nose by the new Accord apparently because of size and styling evaluations. The Camry SE(V6)is quicker with apparently a little harder edge on the ride/handling, FE is a wash despite Honda\\'s use of variable displacement system. Actually surprised that 08 Accord doesnt \\'blow away\\' the 07 Camry - although it certainly sounds like the Accord to buy might just be the one with the new 200hp 4 banger! Of interest to those who want the best?  I am not surprised that the \\'08 Accord didn\\'t blow away the \\'07 Camry in the MT comparo due to:1. The new Camry is a pretty decent performer in the SE form, and that\\'s in both power and handling. I had a rental Camry SE for 3 days earlier this year and came away impressed. The only downside is cheap hard plastic can be found all around the interior.2. MT did select the \\'07 Camry as NA Car of the Year so they really can\\'t make the Camry looks too bad right? :P Now I am looking forward to see what will C&D say when these two go head-to-head in their comparo. Keep in mind the Accord is on C&D\\'s top 10 car list for only the mighty one knows how long.I am a little surprised that the Camry SE actually rides harder than the Accord. It\\'s too bad that Honda doesn\\'t offer a sports edition for the Accord, otherwise it should be a real performer and a legit sports sedan within all the FWD sedans.On a second thought, Honda actually does, it\\'s called the Acura TL... :P  As has been pointed out many times, your \"horrific\" mpg has little to do with the Fusion and much to do with how and where you dirve it.Yes and no, Jeff. Our terrain is as flat as a fritter. The climate is mild. The tires are over inflated slightly, 35 psi, and we are both conservative drivers.Over the same route of travel, our 1997 3.8-liter V6 Thunderbird with four-speed automatic transmission -- a larger, heavier car -- gets 13-15 mpg while our compact 2000 2.0-liter I4 Ford Focus station wagon gets 17-20 mpg.Given that this is 2007, I would expect the mid-size Fusion to be closer to the revised EPA estimate of 17 mpg for this power train and I\\'m very disappointed that, after nine months and 4,600 miles, it doesn\\'t.I suspect the all-wheel drive is the mileage culprit. It\\'s not something I would have specifically ordered, it\\'s just how the car was equipped on the lot.Styling, handling and a good previous experience with the dealer weighed heavily in our decision to go with the Fusion, which is only available in three models: the S, SE and top of the line SEL.In retrospect, we should have shopped around more, taken more time. I was also under the impression that a four-cylinder mil would not be adequate but I now believe that is not the case.We still believe the Fusion is by far the best-looking mid-size in the marketplace and its features are top-notch, too. The fit and finish on our Fusion is perfect.Still, I have this nagging feeling that a four-cylinder Fusion, or even a four-cylinder Accord, would have made me happier nine months after the fact.At least the leather interior still smells good after nine months.   In retrospect, we should have shopped around more, taken more time. I was also under the impression that a four-cylinder mil would not be adequate but I now believe that is not the caseNow that you\\'ve got the car, just enjoy it; you can\\'t turn back time!BUT, if your Focus is adequate for you, a 4-cyl Fusion would have been as quick if not quicker.  Now that you\\'ve got the car, just enjoy it; you can\\'t turn back time!You are right, of course, Grad. The best part is it\\'s paid for, too. No debt associated with it. Feature-wise, it\\'s the nicest car we have ever owned. I just get heartburn every time I fill up the gas tank. BUT, if your Focus is adequate for you, a 4-cyl Fusion would have been as quick if not quicker.The problem is we once owned a four-cylinder Mustang in the late 1980s that was the pits, not enough power to get out of its own way. That was a bad memory. The Focus is fine, however.Today, a four-banger is probably adequate for 90 percent of the population, including me.Did I just read somewhere that Honda\\'s new four is up to 200 horsepower? Our 3.0 Duratec V6 is only rated at 221 horsepower.  I suspect the all-wheel drive is the mileage culprit. It\\'s not something I would have specifically ordered, it\\'s just how the car was equipped on the lot. That is still pretty bad that you don\\'t get atleast 17mpg around town even with the AWD. The AWD in the Fusion is reactive, rather then pro-active. My brother has a 2006 Mazdaspeed6, same AWD system, heavily modded running around 300hp, and he gets 21-22 mpg\\'s around town and 25 highway, when hes not punching it.  Things had certainly improved by the late 80\\'s but a little refresher might be added here about the bad old days. http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z3859/Ford_Mustang/default.aspx\"1975 brought the return of the 302 (5.0 Liter) V-8 however at only 122 horsepower.\"The eighties were better but the fours of that day were a far cry from what\\'s available now.  agree with you on the \\'looking bad\\' contention. It would seem therefore that the new Accord will be the 08 COY as this award is largely based on significance. What is more significant in this or any other segment than a vehicle that will likely be sold 400,000 times or so. It may poach enough Camry sales to become #1 again. The TL-S is that \\'harder\\' Accord you are talking about, but I persnally feel that it falls well short of being a real sports sedan along the lines of the 335 and IS350 - limitations of high HP in FWD (or even FWD biased AWD sedans)  Was that $23,800 sticker for the \\'06 EX with or w/o destination charge? With destination, the 2008 Accord EX sedan is $24,495. For someone who wants a really nice I4 mid-sized sedan, that is pretty good. However... it\\'s only $250 less than a fully-loaded 2008 Sonata Limited V6 (after rebates available to all buyers). The Accord EX-L V6 is nearly $4000 more than the loaded Sonata Limited V6 (although the Accord V6 has the power advantage and a nicer interior). So the Accord is still relatively pricey, I\\'d say. The V6 model has moved into the next class up based on price, i.e. competing more with the likes of the Avalon, Lucerne, and Azera than the Camry and Sonata.  if I remember correctly, isn\\'t your one way commute to work in the Fusion like 5 miles or something short like that where the engine hardly has time to warm up? I mean, if he\\'s getting 17 in a ford escort, flat or not, if a car can barely warm up you\\'re gonna get bad gas mileage!  I don\\'t think the Azera can compete favorably with the 08 Accord. The new Accord is in a different league than the Sonata, IMO. Sure, the Sonata may come close, as far as features, but not in Class, Style, and Refinement. The advantage is more than just \"power\".  The Azera is very close to the Accord in power. It is roomier than the Accord (and interior room is something Honda touts for the new Accord). And it\\'s thousands less than the Accord, in real-world pricing. Class? The Azera is just as \"classy\" in my eyes as the Accord, with much more attractive styling. Style? That too is in the eye of the beholder. Refinement? Depends on how you define it. The Accord will out-handle the Azera. But the Azera is likely the superior highway cruiser, with a very smooth, comfortable ride and hushed environment.It comes down to what someone is looking for in a car. In moving the Accord up-class in room and price for 2008, Honda is for better or worse bumping up against another crop of competitors. If someone is looking for a roomy, luxurious, powerful sedan, there are several other good options out there besides the Accord, for the same or less money. I mentioned but three of them earlier: Avalon, Azera, and Lucerne. Even the CTS is in the same dollar ballpark as the Accord now.  200hp but at a mammoth 7100 rpm ... think most of us would have difficulty pushing any engine that hard. Would be willing to bet, though, that the Honda engine at 7 grand is smoother and quieter than the DT at 5, a point at which they are likely putting out near the same HP.  I am noticing a bit of tire squeal with my Michelin\\'s on the Accord SE V6. When it comes to time to replace the tires, I may opt for less mileage and more grip, say something like a Yokohama or Kumho tire. Seems to me they are really favorably rated at the TireRack, yet low priced. Can not recall the rating professionals tests and consumer surveys on my standard tires, but I think they did OK. In interesting how you can get all season brand X tires which seem to do better than the expensive brands. That said, that too can be hype. One of those things you just have to test yourself. The Michi\\'s should get me plenty of miles, and I would say seem to stick pretty good, though recently after 7K miles, they sure seem to squeal with more ease. Come rain season should be a good test. These tests done on new cars with stability control surely put the limits on those lateral g tests, don\\'t they? And the slalom testing? I still call the Accord a sports sedan like ride, though I realize it can be taken wrong. Of course it is not a Bimmer, but compared to the slow, boat like handling, some of us old timer lived with, this nice cornering, with some good feedback to steering, without that one finger lightness, is so welcomed, I call it sports sedan like. And I am sure an Accord can be pushed through the corners, FWD - heavy nose and all, much quicker than most of the sports cars and muscle cars of days gone bye. I would not push my old pony, the 289 Mustang around a turn as fast as an Accord, or Camry, for that matter. And today\\'s CTS vs, some old Caddy, is like night and day. Of course, there is more to life where it comes to cars, and we must honor the greatness of the old cruisers, or is that luxo liners, the wonderful ships they were.L  The CTS is starting at $34K now  Got to be more costly than an Accord. Speaking of bumping up, there goes the size of the CTS too. They just can\\'t leave these cars alone, where it comes to size. The CTS, with the 3.6V6 seems like a fair deal at $30K, but I guess they need some wiggle room for those massive discounting to come. The economy could change from challenging to down right ugly soon. Who knows? For the car industry, it is a most likely scenario however, as people tighten the purse strings. L  Exactly; we\\'ve hashed this over before (i dont think you were here for that one). It\\'s not the car, it\\'s the commute.  Had a chance to drive a RX-8 and a Porsche Boxter this weekend (my uncle is looking for a fun to drive car to go with his lexus 430... don\\'t we all feel bad for him :P ), and if you want to hear some sweet sounds from an engine, these two had it in spades though they sounded completely different. The rotary engine spins up soooo quickly but even at 8k, it does not sound stressed at all. And Mazda is really good at tuning the sounds in the cabin to make their cars sound pretty muscular, so the RX-8 sounded faster than it was. But as I drove it, I\\'m getting more and more impressed with how mazda tunes their suspensions and chassis. Although the ride is lively, it still dampens bumps really well. My 6 is very similar... though not as low as the RX-8, the suspension is a great balance of road feel and comfort that leaves you feeling engaged but not beat up. The Porsche was the same as far as suspension goes, but it\\'s engine had a lot more testosterone to it... louder, rougher, deeper, but man, was it sweet! Definitely not as smooth sounding as the RX-8, but it\\'s more raw sound was just as appealing. In some ways, the difference between these two cars is how I\\'d compare the sound of the Accord v-6 I test drove vs the Mazda6\\'s Duratec. The Accord does sound really smooth and doesn\\'t growl as much whereas the Mazda6 sounds more meaty, especially in the 3-5k rpm range. There is a rawness to the sound of this engine at 6k when the vvt is in full roar that still gets the hairs on my neck to stand up and all my senses are focused on the road ahead and the balance of the car... wonderful stuff!  So of course I\\'m excited about news about the upcoming Mazda6 that should be coming out mid 08 (as an 09 model), but I see that Honda is supposed to be coming out with an Accord Tourer... hmmmm, could this be the TSX replacement?!? Personally, I think the TSX is what the Accord should be, but I guess Americans like their cars soft and big. Just got to wonder what kind of styling they put on this one. I also wonder if they will put a turbo on it in a type-R version... combined w/ shAWD, that would be something to behold! Anyways, so much to look forward to... too much time to wait!!!  Well, is he going to try all the others, like the Corvette, BMW Z3, S2000 Honda, and such? Looking for new cars? Ya know, if my butt was more narrow so I fit in the MX-5, I would consider one. I personally only fit in the last generations of Miatas. For fun, as in playing in the country, there is nothing better. Now for comfort, I do fit in the RX-8 better. They burn oil as they run, and use a tad more gas, but handle like on rails, for what I have heard. Not sure how many mechanics are trained to fix those engines, but then again, low fail rate, I would think. That Porsche Boxster has to be one of the more expensive cars for an oil change, though I am sure others can even top it. I sure like the looks of the Porsche. And love the looks of the Cayman. That said, the old BMW Z3 was one sexy looking car, and had some great inline six engines in it. Of course on the track, people still favor the Miata, or those S2000 Hondas. Let us know what he decides on. L  A Corvette is next on the list and that ought to be a blast too. We talked about the S2000, but for whatever reason, he\\'s not too enamored by it. I get the feeling he doesn\\'t really like cars that require high revving to get something out of it. Too bad, cuz that drops the lotus off the list  Really, I was very surprised that he wanted to try the rx-8, but car and driver had a really good write up about it recently so we gave it a shot. Although he liked the great handling and of course the value of it (some new ones can be had for around 22k), it felt a little too tight inside and low end torque was non existant. He is considering a 330, but given it\\'s weight is a bit higher up, it\\'s not too likely. The g37 got dropped because he thinks the suspension isn\\'t quite as well sorted as the others mentioned, but he loves the drivetrain. The hardtop mx5 would be nice but they are selling very well and are a bit hard to find unless he gets an 08 which would be available in around a month. But more than likely, he\\'ll get a two year old model f/ an auction and go from there. Regardless, some very fun choices available...  You are right the Azera is classy, but the expression beauty is only skin deep comes to mind with the Azera. The Accord, IMO, can be said beautiful inside, beautiful outside. In pecking order of purchase. Avalon, Lucerne, Azera. Actually I would go for the Avalon and not even look at the other two.  I doubt that seriously, Honda is making big time profit on the V6. I cant believe they are charging such a premium- especially when most Accord buyers pass on the V6 anyway.  When it comes to time to replace the tires, I may opt for less mileage and more grip, say something like a Yokohama or Kumho tire. Seems to me they are really favorably rated at the TireRack, yet low priced.Tires are the single biggest component on the vehicle that affects handling. Replacing bread-and-butter highway tires with a performance tire (something those of us with 4-cyl Accords can\\'t do) will yield substancial increase in handling performance. Also, for your central coast climate, there is no earthly reason you need all season tires. A good summer tire is designed to handle wet and dry roads, and handle the down-poors the rest of the country sees in summer. You might look at the BFG Comp T/A KDW. Those were pretty phenomenal on the Contour, second to the Comp T/A R1s, which were soft compound dedicated racing tires with a treadwear rating of zero. I have also had good luck with the Kumho Ecsta ASX (their psuedo-all season) but would probably recommend one of their \"summer\" oriented tires for your needs.There is a whole Accord Tires/Wheels form discussion that might also be of interest to you.  accord will be on 10Best no matter what. even though C&d wasnt too thrilled with the weight gain and size increase I am willing to bet it will be firmly planted on 10Best in January. The Accord and 3 series are guaranteed spots on that list.  In size, price, performance and power the AZera does stack up well against the Accord. It has everything the accord has except nav/bluetooth and a few features the Accord lacks. Now the Accord can also be seen as competition for the Avalon and Taurus/Sable. The Accord isnt cheap but its still cheaper than its main rivals. Its obvious that Toyota priced the camry so it could be heavily discounted because the MSRPs on them are ridiculous.  I see that Honda is supposed to be coming out with an Accord Tourer... hmmmm, could this be the TSX replacementThe Accord Tourer is a Euro only version. It\\'s the Euro Accord with a wagon body. You won\\'t see it here.  Actually the CTS\\' MSRP starts under $33k with destination. Since some people apparently have no trouble paying a few thousand more for an Accord than, say, a Sonata, then there should be no problem with paying a few thousand more for a car like the CTS compared to the Accord. And I\\'m sure there will be some wiggle room on the CTS. Maybe on the new Accord too, especially the V6, after the initial hoopla has died down, since it is very pricey for this class.  since it is very pricey for this classThe Accord is pricey compared to the Hyundai but not the Camry. Hyundai does not define this class. With Honda and Toyota being far and away the highest volume movers, it makes more sense to price compare the Accord and the Camry. Accord is not trying to be the best price in class, just the best value (features + performance + resale + reliability + reputation - initial cost).  I looked at the CTS\\'s starting price too, online the other day. Since it can be optioned up into the mid $40k range, I\\'ll be curious as to what the dealers will be ordering. Since the DI 3.6 model starts around $35K, I doubt you\\'ll be seeing many CTS\\'s in the low 30s. I\\'d bet most will be pushing $40k. Great looking car though. If I was in the market for a sedan it would be the first car I\\'d test drive. Looks impressive.  It\\'s not like this $2,000 premium for the V6 is a new thing. The current premium is well over $2,000 for a V6 vs. a 4-cyl model on the 2007 models. Why is this so unbelievable on the 2008?? :confuse: For example, with 07 models:EX-L 4-cyl 5MT - $24,250EX-L 4-cyl 5AT - $25,050EX-\" V6 5AT/6MT - $27,400A minimum difference of $2,350 - over $3k if you want a manual.  You\\'re right. Both the Accord and Camry are very pricey for this class, compared to several competitors such as Aura, Fusion, LaCrosse, Milan, Optima, and Sonata that are available for thousands less.The question for each buyer is, are the features/performance/resale/reliability/reputation differences in the Accord and Camry worth the price premium? Given the huge discounts available on the 2007 Accord and the Camry, it appears the general answer is \"no\". Honda and Toyota have been forced to put large incentives on their mid-sizers and dealers have had to discount them in order to compete with the lower-priced alternatives. (If Accord and Camry were worth their price premium, there would be no need for discounting, right?) I expect to see big discounts on the 2008 Accord too once the usual \"new model\" fascination fades.  The question for each buyer is, are the features/performance/resale/reliability/reputation differences in the Accord and Camry worth the price premium? Given the huge discounts available on the 2007 Accord and the Camry, it appears the general answer is \"no\". Eh, to be fair, the Accord was at the very end of a 5 year run and lacks some of the options and features available on other, more contemporary models.I expect to see big discounts on the 2008 Accord too once the usual \"new model\" fascination fades.There is getting to be less and less to differentiate the field of competitors. Mid-size sedans are starting to become a commodity market and unless you stand out, no one gets a premium.  Go rent an Accord for a week. Record your mileage under your actual driving conditions. Then see you will have a basis for comparison.That would be a fairly expensive proposition and I\\'m not so sure what it would prove. If the Accord got the same mileage, 14.8, I guess I would feel better. But if it got say 17-20 mpg in city driving I would be depressed. Besides, Accords are not available with AWD, not even the 2008s. In order to do a fair comparison the cars would need to have very similar drive trains.Also, while the fuel economy is poor, given the number of miles traveled, it sounds like the financial impact is negligible.Yup, we put very few miles on the car, 4,600 in nine months, so the pain is somewhat subdued, thankfully. To be honest I thought the car would deliver its EPA estimate. The original one was 19 mpg city/26 highway. The revised one is 17 mpg city/24 highway.On the only trip we have taken with it, a 360-mile jaunt, the Fusion did deliver 26 mpg going and 24 mpg returning with speeds of 60-70 mph.People on the four forums I visit report generally good mileage for the 3.0-liter V6 but very few report good mileage with the AWD option.As I\\'ve said repeatedly, our Fusion is a really nice car except for the gasoline mileage dealio. I would recommend one, without the AWD, to anyone and everyone.It\\'s a personal preference thing, but I think the Fusion is the hands-down style winner in the mid-size segment but not everyone agrees, of course.  So looks like the Euro 6 will be getting a larger 4 cylinder that is a 2.5 liter rated at 170HP. The car is supposed to be 40kg lighter and braking supposedly has been improved from it\\'s current impressive (for this segment) level. Mazda is also claiming the car will be quieter than the current model, though the sound from the engine is supposed to be tuned have an aggressive sound. Looks like bluetooth, adaptive cruise control and a push button start will be available. But the bad news... a mazda rep said that the wagon and hatchback may not make it to the states the first year!!! What a bunch of hooie! These different body styles were a main reason I bought the 6, and I know many others with this car who feel the same. Also, the rumor persists that the sheetmetal on this euro 6 will be different f/ the US 6... another thing that I\\'m not too happy about as I think the 6 they previewed looks distinctive, aggressive, and classy (though not as streamlined like the current 6...). Well at least there is some new news about the 6...  If you got 25 or so MPG on your trip then it seems obvious to me that there is nothing wrong with your Fusion. It\\'s strictly the route, because you got the stated EPA claims on the highway (the easiest, most error-free way to test - too much varies in what is considered normal \"CITY\" driving). Steady highway is steady highway though.  found this f/ autoweb:North AmericaThere will be a dedicated new Mazda6 for the North American market, designed and engineered specifically for North America. More information will be provided during Summer 2008, closer to the launch of the North American model.booooooo!!!! :mad: :mad:  Aww, sorry guys!!!

I am pretty sure the exterior will remain pretty much align with the Euro Mazda6 since the Euro model looks pretty much like all those spy shots we saw earlier. Since there are no new Mazda6 spy shots I am willing to bet that what we saw in Frankfurt is pretty much what we are getting here. It probably will come with a different headlight, grille and backlight, that\\'s about it.Engine is what worries me. I hope we will be getting the same 3.8L V6 like the Euro 6 does instead of the Ford DT 3.5.

There is no V6 for the European Mazda6. Yes you are right. I meant the 3.8L V6 as in rumor.  It\\'s getting a 3.7L version of the current 3.5L which will put out around 275-280 hp. It will be built in Japan.  Accord\\'s pricing is clearly based on the fact that they dont plan for buyers to cross shop anything but Camry. I\\'m sure that philosophy is correct since most Accord buyers probably dont look farther than Camry or Altima. COmpared to those two the accord looks good, but not compared to the rest of the field.  I agree with you, Camry and Altima would be their pricing benchmarks.But it wouldn\\'t make any sense for the second best selling sedan to benchmark the prices of the 4th, 5th and 6th best sellers.  \"Given the huge discounts available on the 2007 Accord and the Camry, it appears the general answer is \"no\".

The difference between Camry MSRP and TMV is pretty substantial which means Toyota has to grantnice discounts to keep volume up. Its funny because people will say \"the impala is largely successful because of fleet sales\" but to me thats no different from Toyota selling Camrys for $4k under sticker to keep volume up. Accord sales were way up last month due to discounting on the 2007 model to clear it out. The bottom line is Toyota (moreso than Honda) is bringing the transaction price of the camry down closer to the \"inferior\" competition to keep sales high. This is one reason why the Camry will remain the #1 car in American indefinitely.  It\\'s getting a 3.7L version of the current 3.5L which will put out around 275-280 hp.

Remember, total sales of one brand is one thing, but overall segment sales are another. Chevy sells more midsize cars than Honda (if we count impala) and GM sells more midsize cars than Toyota (including all brands for both). If Gm consolidated all its brands and named all midsize non luxury sedans \"malibu\" it would outsell camry. The sales race for a particular brand is really about bragging rights and little else. F150 is best selling pickup and I\\'m not sure what that proves other than Ford has huge capacity to build them and they are willing to offer huge rebates to move them.  Camry has a \"2007 clearance sale\" going on right now thus the close to $4K discount.

What they are doing is building a class benchmark with competitive pricing among the leaders (Altima and Camry) to win over potential buyers.Undercut in price what a new comer will do in order to gain share in a quick way. The best examples are Sonata and Fusion. Toyota is also doing the same thing for its new Tundra.  The bottom line is Toyota (moreso than Honda) is bringing the transaction price of the camry down closer to the \"inferior\" competition to keep sales high.I hope the quote marks around \"inferior\" was meant as sarcasm because I don\\'t consider the other mid-sizers to be inferior to a Camry.This is one reason why the Camry will remain the #1 car in American indefinitely.Unless there is another engine sludge episode.   You\\'re assuming that other \"lesser/inferior\" lower priced cars competing with the Camry aren\\'t also selling for $4K under sticker. An unlikely assumption at this time of the year (closeout).  Fleet sales. You can give away any product in the World, and end up with great numbers for volume. The bottom line is profit. And to the customer resale value. L  All manufactures charge more for a V6. And this has been since the start of time; well automotive sales time that is. Hell, doesn\\'t GM charge if you want real tires on your car? You can end up with Hankook or some other cheapo\\'s on there. OK, maybe Hankook is a good tire - don\\'t know, but it is a Korean tire. I thought GM was the all American brand? Looks to me like a 3.6V6 in the Aura XR has a premium price placed on it. No - Honda charging for a V6 is not out of the ordinary. Just get the SE to get the reasonable package associated with the V6 buy. Or pay more get all the other stuff, many seem to enjoy. Life has options. L  Prices are relatively unchanged!Not according to this: http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=122554Honda said on Monday that its 2008 Accord sedan will carry a starting price of $20,995, including a $635 destination charge. That reflects a $1,775 increase over the outgoing 2007 model.  when a loaded Camry is $35k I dont think the discounting is solely due to clearance sales. Besides the discounts offered by dealers are usually equal to or greater than the factory rebates.  \"But it wouldn\\'t make any sense for the second best selling sedan to benchmark the prices of the 4th, 5th and 6th best sellers. \"actually Tundra is more expensive than most competitors. I dont know that we can call the Accord a benchmark when it really isnt offering anything not offered on the competition and is not offering quite a few things offered on the competition. What we can say is that the 2008 model is adding a lot of features it should\\'ve had a while ago and has essentially caught up to the competition. Accord\\'s sales have dropped for the lastr 3 years or so, I\\'m not sure why you are saying they dont need to increase share. The sales gap between accord and camry has only gotten larger in recent years.  Point is the fact that the camry needs $4k in discounts to sell ANY time is a testament to the fact that the car is priced too high. Its amazing how everyone is forgetting that Toyota (unlike its american counterparts) is supposed to be a master of supply and demand and not need to rely on sales to move products. Am I the only one who remembers this? We all know Sonotas have big rebates as do some other models, but the camry is one of the newest midsize cars on the market and has a far better reputation than Sonata, Malibu, mazda6, etc.  \"Tires are the single biggest component on the vehicle that affects handling. Replacing bread-and-butter highway tires with a performance tire (something those of us with 4-cyl Accords can\\'t do) will yield substancial increase in handling performance. \" Why won\\'t I be able to put better handling tires on my 2007 Accord when the Turanzas wear out?Oh, you will, as long as you don\\'t mind replacing your wheels with 17\" ones or having the speedometer be off the whole time. There are no performance tires in a 205/60/16, in fact, I can\\'t think of another car that uses that size. What they should\\'ve done is used 205/55R16s like everyone else on the face of the earth where a plethora of tires in all categories are available in all price ranges. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. I remember when Honda used to make a sports sedan Oh well, it will be worth something in 3 years and if I drive nicely, it might not need tires and I will be able to get something more performance oriented.  You are missing my point here, Honda is charging $2200 for the engine ONLY. Compare XR and XE and you will see they are separeted by more than a motor. You didnt mention that 6 speed auto, 18\" wheels, stability, auto climate control, 8 way seat, 6 CD changer, premium sound system and auto dimming mirror are included in the $3500 premium you pay for the XR. Not quite the same as what Honda is doing with the Accord. On the Fusion I think a V6 is worth about $1000-$1500 at the most. Most base models in the midsize segment come with \"cheap\" tires, Aura is no exception. Just because they are Hankook doesnt mean they are any cheaper than lower end continentals or goodyears.  I think you can safely call the 2nd best selling family car in the country a \\'benchmark\\'. The 2003-2006 model was a benchmark for the category. It would be surprising if the 2008 model is not also. That the 2008 has added features that it \\'should\\'ve had a while ago\\' seems like an odd statement. They added features because it is a new model. They did not add them a \\'while ago\\' because they haven\\'t brought out an all-new Accord since 2003.  That article is a little misleading. Remember, Honda has now dropped the DX/VP trim levels, making the LX the entry level sedan for 2008. The quote should be that a base model 2008 Accord (an LX) will cost $1,775 more than the outgoing 2007 base model (a VP). It should also mention that compared to a 2007 VP, the 2008 LX has much more standard features. IMO it is well worth the $1,775.MSRP for my \\'07 LX manual was over $20k, so the difference between the \\'07 LX and the \\'08 is not so much. The LX and EX were by far the volume sellers anyway, it is very rare to see a DX or VP.The only way that dropping the DX/VP may hurt Honda is in \"bait and switch\" style comparisons, where a competitor is able to advertise a midsize sedan for much less than $20k. Of course, their ad car would be stripped out, and to compare it to a base Accord wouldn\\'t be apples-to-apples, but that is wait the bait and switch is all about, right?  There are no performance tires in a 205/60/16, in fact, I can\\'t think of another car that uses that size. That\\'s funny - tirerack.com shows 14 high performance or ultra high performance all season tires in that size including Yokohama, Pirelli, Bridgestone, Dunlop, Firestone and Goodyear.  I dont know that we can call the Accord a benchmark You need to drive the Accord and [almost] every other midsizer in this segment before making that statement.I can only tell from my personal experience. My family owns an Accord, a Camry and I drove the Mazda6, Fusion, Altima and Impala before. Without reading all the car mags I concluded myself that Accord has the best combination of comfort and performance.  There are no performance tires in a 205/60/16, in fact, I can\\'t think of another car that uses that size.That\\'s funny - tirerack.com shows 14 high performance or ultra high performance all season tires in that size including Yokohama, Pirelli, Bridgestone, Dunlop, Firestone and Goodyear.Actually, it shows 8, the RE92 (which dates back to the 80s and not exactly the pinnacle of high performance then either) and the Yokahama AVID(which is a speed rated touring tire on other websites), the Firestone Firerock, and Pirelli are each listed twice at H-speed rating and V. Of those 8, only the Summitomo is listed as an \"ultra\" anything, and it gets raped in the reviews. In comparison, the Mazda6 actually lists Ultra-high-performance and high-performance summer tires like the Pirelli P-zero, BFGoodrich g-Force T/A KDW,Kumho Ecsta SPT, Michelin Pilot, which are unavailable for the Honda, as well as all season tires like the Dunlop SP Sport 5000 Symmetrical (a personal favorite of mine, great tires on the Contour in Michigan), Kumho Ecsta ASX (another favorite and an incredible bargain to boot), etc.I guess I bought an old people\\'s car. :mad:   Then you should have said they didn\\'t offer any performance tires that you like.Just get the 225/55R16 instead of the 205/60R16. The difference in sidewall height is less than 1mm (123.0 vs. 123.75) and should work just fine. The Kumho Ecsta SPT is only $82 in that size.  Or within $400 of the price of a New Malibu. Sooooo, what ya think of that $19,999 price for a New Malibu. Want to bet on that one sticking?Loren  I bet ya there are owners of the Ford Fusion which would pay $2,200 for a Honda engine instead of a four banger, or for that matter the Ford V6. And when you get the SE V6 Accord you get a lot of stuff, including the alloy wheels with Michelin tires (17\" cost enough, thank you, I see no need for the cost of 18\" wheels, nor the extra unsprung weight) and it has stability control, and windows which can be lowered with the electronic key. An SE has a 5 sp transmission, which seems to work just fine. And no it doesn\\'t had auto climate control, but then again, I can move the little dial for cooler or warmer, without it taxing my mind. Dimming mirror sounds a bit interesting, though I prefer, unless too painful, to have the better view behind me, and only adjust for those SUV and trucks with the taller light positions, which should be illegal. As for seats, it doesn\\'t have lumbar support, and that is something which was an oversight on Honda\\'s part -- should have been standard. The car is identical priced to the Aura XR. Well, at the time of purchase. In five years, we can pretty well do an educated guess as to which has the greater value. Aura XR is a pretty neat little ride -- pretty quick, with a sharp enough handling to satisfy most people. As for XE and XR pricing difference being more than a motor, the same holds for Accord SE i4 and V6. The i4 doesn\\'t have stability control, for example. Not sure about the 2008 models. As for tires, I don\\'t think Honda is going to use any cheap tire, but I could be wrong. Will have to look around next visit. Hyundai seems to use all Michelin\\'s. I set a personal record for wear with a GM car in \\'86, as it had Goodyear Customs, which wore down in 8,000 miles. Never topped that one :sick: Loren  Try comparing similar models and see what you come up with.Honda brings out the Value Package halfway through its life-cycle. Otherwise, compare an LX to an LX to get an idea on pricing. What you\\'ve posted is a sly way of implying that all Accord trims will have that price increase, when in fact, they have just done away with the cheapie level altogether.  Sorry, didn\\'t know they were changing the base model. I also am not familiar with the history of the \"value package\". No \"slyness\" intended on my part...not sure why edmunds did not clarify the change in base models in the article. Still, that is a pretty hefty increase in the minimum entry price.  You need to drive the Accord and [almost] every other midsizer in this segment before making that statement. I have, and though its a very nice car, I don\\'t see the benchmark thing.  What is more significant in this or any other segment than a vehicle that will likely be sold 400,000 times or soI read the article wehre the guy in charge of honda NA made that prediction. I\\'m skeptical, and guess that to be more wishfull thinking than anything else. Not that the car itself will be the reason, but sales of midsize cars have been dropping for a decade now, and is still falling. People want smaller and more fuel efficent. about the only way any manufacture can incrase their sales units in the midsize section is by taking from the other guy. considering the domestics +hyundai/kia and the rest have probably been beat down now about as much as they can be, you only have the altima and camry to take away from. and thats a pretty tall order even for honda. Add to the mix the current econmic climate, the high probability that the economy will continue to slow if not slip into recession and that 400k copies seems even less likely. I don\\'t think the next couple of years is going to be very bright for any of the automakers. going to be real tough to start posting record sales with a vehicle that likely wont be discounted at all.  Just get the 225/55R16 instead of the 205/60R16. The difference in sidewall height is less than 1mm (123.0 vs. 123.75) and should work just fine. The Kumho Ecsta SPT is only $82 in that size.Do you think that will fit on my stock rim width and clear the suspension components?That might actually be a viable alternative.  I\\'m coming in late to this conversation, but when has the Camry ever needed $4k in discounts to sell?  I also wonder where they\\'re comming up with their prices. acording to toyota\\'s website, the camry goes from 18570 to 25000. how do you add 10 grand in options? I built one selecting every single option, even stuff like first aid kit, wheel locks, sport peddals, ect, and couldnt get it over 34k. and most of that stuff is just accesories.  It seems that to some people the Accord and Camry can do no right. If there are no discounts, the prices are too high. If there are discounts/incentives they are doing it because of competition from the number 5 and 6 sellers. The Camry, Accord, and Altima are each others main competition, and are priced to compete with each other. These cars are not priced to compete with Malibu, Sonata, or Fusion, and should not be.  I dont know that we can call the Accord a benchmark when it really isnt offering anything not offered on the competition and is not offering quite a few things offered on the competition. What we can say is that the 2008 model is adding a lot of features it should\\'ve had a while ago and has essentially caught up to the competition. Accord\\'s sales have dropped for the lastr 3 years or so, I\\'m not sure why you are saying they dont need to increase share. The sales gap between accord and camry has only gotten larger in recent years.\"A benchmark does not mean that it has features no other car has. In fact today, there is no car (in any segment) that as exclusive features. The Accord has been a gold standard in the midsize segment and is considered a benchmark by most of the automotive press.  \"Point is the fact that the camry needs $4k in discounts to sell ANY time is a testament to the fact that the car is priced too high.\"Are there 4k rebates/discounts on the Camry? I would be quite surprised if this was true. Please don\\'t tell me you are counting from MSRP downwards.  Check the prices again. For example, the Camry XLE V6 starts at $28,720 before any options, and is $31,520 with options like VSC, heated seats, nav, and smart key. Without nav and smart key it is still just under $30k. Is there $6000 more value there than on a car like the Aura or Sonata?  \"You are missing my point here, Honda is charging $2200 for the engine ONLY. Compare XR and XE and you will see they are separeted by more than a motor. You didnt mention that 6 speed auto, 18\" wheels, stability, auto climate control, 8 way seat, 6 CD changer, premium sound system and auto dimming mirror are included in the $3500 premium you pay for the XR. Not quite the same as what Honda is doing with the Accord. On the Fusion I think a V6 is worth about $1000-$1500 at the most.\"Or it could be the other way around - Saturn is making a lot of money on the lower end XE than the XR - adding a V6 and all those extras for only 2k!In most cars that offer a choice of engines (except GM/Ford whose base engines are ancient, though GM is righting that now), there is a 2-3k difference in price. I don\\'t see why you are so surprised if this is the case with the Accord as well.  \"No \"slyness\" intended on my part..\"Don\\'t buy that; hard to believe you would not pick LX vs LX in marking out pricing differences. Its pretty basic stuff.  \"It seems that to some people the Accord and Camry can do no right. If there are no discounts, the prices are too high. If there are discounts/incentives they are doing it because of competition from the number 5 and 6 sellers\"Don\\'t worry on that account Elroy - for more than 800k people every year the Accord and Camry do just fine. What we are delaing with here is a group of people who just don\\'t like the Accord OR the Camry - nothing can change that. Even before the 08 Accord came out, I can bet most of us knew what their comments would be.  Last year 481k Americans saw this value - thousands make this decision everymonth and even more if you count Accord and Altima buyers.There are others who compare features and decide that cars are equal and buy the cheaper ones - more power to them.  In fact today, there is no car (in any segment) that as exclusive features. That is untrue. Counter-examples are the Fit\\'s magic seats (unique in the low-end car segment), the Elantra SE\\'s standard ESC (unique in the economy car segment), the Altima I4\\'s standard 6-speed MT (unique in the mid-sized class), and the Chrysler minivans\\' Stow-and-Go and, now, pop-up rear table with swivel middle seats.  \"Unless there is another engine sludge episode\"A case of sour grapes?  How many Camry and Accord (and Altima) buyers bought their cars at huge discounts last year? Maybe not as much value there as Toyota, Honda, and Nissan would lead us to believe. I am really curious to see how the new Accord will sell without the incentives it\\'s had for the past couple of years... and how long it takes for incentives to return. That will tell us how good it really is, and how loyal the Honda fans are.  \"That is untrue. Counter-examples are the Fit\\'s magic seats (unique in the low-end car segment), the Elantra SE\\'s standard ESC (unique in the economy car segment), the Altima I4\\'s standard 6-speed MT (unique in the mid-sized class), and the Chrysler minivans\\' Stow-and-Go and, now, pop-up rear table with swivel middle seats.\"This is just nit picking, very small differences. Elantra has standard ESC, but not exclusive ESC. Other cars in its range have this feature available. That way I can say Accord has cylinder deactivation exclusive, or a 190HP I4 exclusive, or ESP across the line; however I don\\'t see these as maor differences making any car a benchmark. Would you say the Fit is a benchmark because it has magic seats, or is the Elantra a benchmark because it has ESP standard, or the Chrysler minivans are benchmarks because of these features? No sir.  \"How many Camry and Accord (and Altima) buyers bought their cars at huge discounts last year? Maybe not as much value there as Toyota, Honda, and Nissan would lead us to believe.

That will tell us how good it really is, and how loyal the Honda fans are.\" And how many Sonata buyers have bought with discounts/rebates ever since the present model was launched (each and everyone)? Would you say there have been more disocunts on the Accord than on the Sonata? Not much value as Hyundai would have us believe.  My 2003 had the 205/60-16 tires and I was able to replace them with a set of 2007 Accord rims and tires that I bought off of ebay for the price of new tires. The tires had little if any wear and the rims were spotless. The speedometer difference is only 0.9% difference which works out to about 1/2 mph at 60. This is well within the margin of error of factory speedometers. This gives me more options when I need new tires and better looking rims IMHO.  When the 06 Sonata came out many said it was a world beater, and was going to make BIG waves in the midsize segment. I\\'ve seen bigger waves in the kiddie pool. I think people went to the Hyundai dealer looking for a deal, and believed everything the salesmen told them. All hype, no substance.  The statement was that no car in any class has an exclusive feature. Like most sweeping statements, it\\'s not true. I don\\'t think it\\'s nit-picking to point that out. Maybe it\\'s nitpicking to challenge hard facts?The Fit\\'s magic seats are certainly unique in its class, and a distinguishing feature--whether it alone makes the Fit the benchmark for low-end cars is debatable. And Stow-and-Go is certainly a unique feature. And having standard ESC is an important feature--but one that the Accord does not have for its class, btw (Sonata beat it to the punch by 2-1/2 years).  Why do you suppose Honda and Toyota had to offer such big discounts on their mid-sized cars in the past two years? Was it out of the goodness of their hearts? Or maybe it was because of intense price competition from cars like the Sonata and Optima that have become very competitive in that time? And might that constitute more than a ripple in the kiddie pool?  The Accord, Camry, and Altima are being discounted because they are competing with each other, and trying to outsell each other. The Sonata and Optima have no effect at all, IMO. The big fish are fighting amongst themselves, to see who will eat the most little fish.  You can say the Sonata and Optima are competitive, but they are not where it counts, SALES.  1487 is the Anti-Accord. Need to get him into the Anti Accord Anonymous right away for a meeting. just trying to be helpful, Loren  jd10013,I think what they must be talking about is a fully loaded camry hybrid or and xle......which I assume would be around $35k. That is not very expensive compared to a lot of other cars, especially when you get a very nice fully loaded car.  Drive the Sonata, and Accord V6 the same day. Test used ones, so you can punch the gas, take a few corners in each, seek out some bumps along the way, then get back to us with your conclusion. I am thinking you will find the Accord a notch above the Sonata. Not saying the Sonata is not a value priced item. Just taken through the paces of stop - go, turn, for the road test, then a good look around of interiors, and my bet is that the winner is not Sonata. The Aura XR comes closer for performance, though is a tad smaller inside than the Accord, and of course smaller than the Sonata. Sonata does have room inside. All three have some good points to them. My Accord has ESC, but the i4 engine Accords do not. Actually, this is or was the Sonata selling point, from warranty to most features per dollar, we have it. Yeap, this is so. As for being as good a car, I think not. It is close, but no cigar. Now, if bought at the right price, would it be a darn good buy for most people? Well, value has its place in the car world, and Sonata is certainly there -- buyer decision of say almost as good for thousands less up front, with thousand lost when later sold.Seems to be a wash in a way. L  Is there $6000 more value there than on a car like the Aura or Sonata? Now c\\'mon backy, you know better than this! One person\\'s value system is not the same as mine or yours. We\\'ve hashed this out with a mysteriously quiet Ford owner before - you right here with me!  I only asked the question. I didn\\'t answer it. That\\'s for each buyer to decide for himself/herself.  I\\'m sorry, I had just had some eerie flashbacks to a turmoiltuous forum... Indeed you didnt answer it; just seemed to imply otherwise.I think I\\'m just a little TOO tired to be on here tonight and am heading to bed! (School and Work for 12 hours does that - even to this 20 year old!).Night all!   I drove the 2006 Sonata GLS I4 and Accord EX I4 back to back over the exact same course. I wrote a detailed review at the time, in another discussion. My conclusion was that the Sonata out-pointed the Accord, based on my criteria for mid-sized cars. My main issues with the Accord were a feel-every-bump ride (I know, some people like that; I don\\'t); much less interior room; a cave-like interior with cheap-looking cloth (no longer an issue); lack of ESC (no longer an issue); and a much higher price. Also the Accord was the car with the rattles, interestingly enough (both were brand new, off dealer lots). And there\\'s that Hyundai warranty of course. I also prefer the looks of the Sonata to the 2006-7 Accord (and the new Accord, for that matter), although I do like the dash on the Accord better, and it does have superior handling and slightly better fuel economy. But who knows, I might find the 2008 Accord tops the Sonata.The moral is, each buyer has to drive the cars against their criteria and see what comes out on top for them, and if it\\'s the more expensive car, then how much is the difference worth to them?  I would say the top line Camry and the Tundra trucks may very well be overpriced. Not sure a $4K off sticker is enough to make them a buy or not. I certainly would not pay $26K for a Camry. But then again, I would not pay $34K to $45K for a CTS. I would say a Camry is worth up to $24K and a CTS perhaps $30K. A Sonata is perhaps worth up to $20K if loaded up. And a Fusion, perhaps is worth somewhere around $20K to 21K. The coming months should tell, if car sales really - really slide. And no, a Camry top of the line, is a bit out of control price wise. This is not a luxury car. What is a BMW3 now, say starting at $34k? Considering the Euro vs Dollar, those seem inexpensive. A fine RWD car, with world class handling is worth a lot more than a Camry XLE.L  For a ride which absorbs the bumps, and is more smooth / easy going, perhaps one may consider the Camry. It tested a Sonata, and thought it had hit the stops a couple times, when impacting some holes and bumps in the road. Could be wrong, it made some sort of sound which was just like hitting the end of the shock travel. Yes, a Sonata seems very roomy. And you could also get an Azera for the Camry price. One thing though which is worrisome for those owners is lack of retail sales. Seems like Sonata and Azeras are not selling like they should. Many fleet sales of Sonatas to make up the difference. Could be just me, but it seems like a lot of buzz and some good sales going on for the Sonata, then it kinda hit the wall. It is a very crowded market. Have you noticed less Hyundai ads and more Kia these days, or is that just around my area? Oh yeah, I am kinda liking the looks of the Elantra these days. Nice looking smaller car.L  the dealer didn\\'t have v6 yet, so i test drove graphite on grey LX. and what a let down. it just felt like a bigger civic to me. i no longer want anything to do with 4 cylinders. accord felt like a civic\\'s brother and i certainly didn\\'t felt any of 177hp. i\\'m not even sure if i liked it more than the previous gen lx. interior looked great in person, but the over all interior volume looked about the same. i thought it became bigger, but i didn\\'t see or feel any difference inside. the cloth was too smooth IMO. it\\'s almost slippery. well, i\\'m going to test drive v6 whenever it comes out. but overall i\\'m thoroughly disappointed by honda. i would take the last gen\\'s v6 over any 08\\'s cylinder combination in a heartbeat. and the price is about the same anyway. probably cheaper because i can get a loaded exl v6 without the leather under 23k OTD. anyway, i test drove azera again shortly after my trip to honda dealer. loved everything about it except the green interior light. what a turn off.. gosh, there is no car out there for me.. oh by the way, i\\'m test driving because i\\'m trading my 06 civic. we need something bigger.  I sure agree with you on the Starfire. I had a 75 model, and, the brakes were so under designed, they were dangerous. I know GM is now building some nice stuff, but, I still can\\'t bring myself to buy it. I really got burned on my last new GM car - an 85 Celebrity. You know how bad they were. To win me back, they\\'re going to have to show me products that are well engineered, reliable, pleasingly styled, and a better value than the competition.Regards:OldCEM  My 2003 had the 205/60-16 tires and I was able to replace them with a set of 2007 Accord rims and tires that I bought off of ebay for the price of new tires. The tires had little if any wear and the rims were spotless. The speedometer difference is only 0.9% difference which works out to about 1/2 mph at 60. This is well within the margin of error of factory speedometers. This gives me more options when I need new tires and better looking rims IMHO.Did you get 17\" wheels? I am pretty sure this is my only option at this point, and throwing some snow tire on the old rim or something.  I just don\\'t like the Camry that much. IMO quality has declined from past generations (esp. the interior), I don\\'t like the looks, the ride is too soft (haven\\'t tried the SE), and key features I want particularly VSC are options. I just don\\'t see spending a lot more for it than for something like the Optima (which btw has bested the Camry I4 in several pro comparos).I am not worried about sales volumes. If I were, I\\'d buy an F Series or Silverado.  Sonatas and Optimas will not outsell Camcords anytime in the forseeable future, and that\\'s not an issue as far as I am concerned. Little known fact that Hyundai has just about maxed out their production in Alabama, which makes Sonatas and Santa Fes. They did that while cutting back on Sonata rental sales compared to prior years. I\\'ve seen just as many Camrys in the Hertz lots lately as I have Sonatas. No one talks about that though. I don\\'t see many ads for ANY cars lately, as I just don\\'t watch much commercial TV anymore. No time, not much worth seeing. I\\'d rather watch a good movie.  You didn\\'t by any chance have the stick shift Starfire? It was so funny. You have to almost use two feet to depress the clutch, it was just so stiff. After a number of years, the plate which held the cable pulled straight on through the firewall. They welded on a plate and replace the cable line. One day, a friend jumps in the car, and pulls the door handle to close the door. It just came off. I looked at it and it was but a screw into who knows what, say cardboard. The car was the lime green metallic, and did look very cool when new. Thinking I was so smart to save money, and have an easier car to work on, I bought it without air conditioning. Well, let\\'s just say, not the best of ideas on my part. Those Las Vegas trips got pretty hot. Olds. suspensions just ate the front tires like crazy. Oh well, I had fun, and it would not go fast enough to need much brake power. It had those matching color wheels -- woo-hoo! In 1977 model year, they counterbalanced the engine. Of course my car was the \\'76. Guess I should have gone all out and got a Datsun Z car, or something else. The Porsche 914 was cool, but only quick enough I guess, with that optional six engine. And there would go the price. Then came the Porsche 924 with the Audi truck engine. Ya know, come to think of it, things sure got weird. Jimmy Carter was president, there for awhile, and then there was disco. Heck, the only thing still normal was a Corvette  Well until the power meltdown. Oh yeah, the 80 MPH speedometers in Vettes and all cars, for that matter. Good God, I am having a flashback to 55 MPH speed limits. I best look ahead -- never back to that time. :surprise: Fast forward to today. Well the Corvette is looking good, but I don\\'t have that sort of spare change at the moment. The \\'07 CTS was pretty neat, but then again, a bit pricey, and I am not sold on it being worth the price, though it may well be. Those GM cars of Epsilon aren\\'t so bad, as long as you avoid the ones with electric assist steering. Heck, most of the GM stuff is not too bad category. The new and exciting below $25K price stuff is yet to come, as in the RWD cars. Sure the New Malibu and other Epsilons are adequate, to very good, but I am talking something new and enticing, like perhaps the Aussie cars, or the Impala to come. There is the new stuff =2009?L  Could you please elaborate as to why you wouldn\\'t pay $26k for a Camry or $45k for a CTS.....I am curious as to why. Is that out of your price range? Or do you think paying that much for a car is ridiculous.So...is a $70k for a Corvette overpriced too? \"Nicer\" cars tend to cost more. Some people are happy spending $10 on a watch, whereas others prefer to spend $10,000 on a nicer watch. To each his own I guess.  In most cars that offer a choice of engines (except GM/Ford whose base engines are ancient...The Fusion\\'s 2.3L base engine is \"ancient\"? From what I can tell the original design is maybe 1 year older than Accord\\'s 4 cyl.  I think I\\'m just a little TOO tired to be on here tonight and am heading to bed! (School and Work for 12 hours does that - even to this 20 year old!). Must be those old man cars you drive grad. :P  \"That the 2008 has added features that it \\'should\\'ve had a while ago\\' seems like an odd statement. They added features because it is a new model. They did not add them a \\'while ago\\' because they haven\\'t brought out an all-new Accord since 2003.\"There is nothing odd about the statemtnt at all. The new Accord has caught up to 2007 Camry and Altima in power and features and thus I do not see what the big deal is supposed to be. Its great for an Accord since the current model is lacking so many features but its not offering anything new. If we are basing \"benchmark\" status on sales I fail to see how the #2 car is the one to beat. Care to explain that one?  \"I\\'m coming in late to this conversation, but when has the Camry ever needed $4k in discounts to sell? \"right now. Look at Edmunds TMV or your local paper if you have doubts. Camrys arent selling for anywhere near MSRP.  \"The Camry, Accord, and Altima are each others main competition, and are priced to compete with each other. These cars are not priced to compete with Malibu, Sonata, or Fusion, and should not be. \"Um, why should they not be? They are not head and shoulders above the competition anymore. They are very competent cars as are most cars in this class. I think the \\'08 Malibu is very competitive and can stand toe to toe with any of those three cars you have on a pedastal. Sales dont mean much in terms of best in class. Just look at pickups or small car sales. Corolla is best selling small car but few would say its the best small car on the market.As for Altima sales, it should be noted that the Impala outsold it last year and will this year as well. Not sure why you are saying the three japanese cars are in a class alone.  \"The Accord has been a gold standard in the midsize segment and is considered a benchmark by most of the automotive press. \"Actually just C&D. I would love for you to find the last comparison test the Accord won in another publication. MT, Edmunds, Motorweek and others do not consider the current car the benchmark. MT just gave the new model a SLIGHT edge over the Camry SE but the newest car in the segment is often the best for a short time. The Current Accord is a good car in a field of good cars. Its design, performance and mileage were all about average and its feature content/value equation were below average.  \"Are there 4k rebates/discounts on the Camry? I would be quite surprised if this was true. Please don\\'t tell me you are counting from MSRP downwards. \"I did not say FACTORY REBATES, I am saying the actual selling price of a camry is $3k+ under MSRP these days. If the camry was another brand people would be saying Toyota has to \"give them away\" to keep volume up. A car that is in high demand doesnt need that kind of discounting to sell. The camrys natural volume is considerably lower than the 40k cars they are selling a month but its obvious that Toyota wants to keep sales very high.  check the 2008 models and you will see what I am talking about. The 2008 EX-L 4 costs over $2k less than the EX-L V6 model with the same equipment. if you measure cheapness of tire by how quickly they were than high cost sports tires are the worst out there. Many of them last less than 20k miles. \"cheap\" non performance tires will likely last far longer than that, even if they are Korean. I never knew you were so against imported parts on a car since you are such a Honda fan.  Although you so firmly believe Hyundai is an afterthought in this (or probably any other automotive size segment)please keep in mind that both Honda and Toyota have had decades (since at least 1976 for the Accord and 1985 for the Camry)to \"sell\" the buying public on the \"goodness\" of these cars. Hyundai is a new-comer\". Were the early versions of these great cars? In a word..NO. The Honda\\'s rusted out early on (still do in certain rust belt regions)and Toyota has had their problems also. Refer to the recent \"sludge\" problems. Refer also to transmission problems on the Odyssey. Do these problems deter zelots from buying Honda and Toyota again? Nope...the next one will be better (for sure) but for joe average who decided to try one of those brands because of all the hyperbole and got problems instead of goodness, well they are among those who decided to give Hyundai a try. What!!?? Honda or Toyota defectors?, happens all the time. So far Hyundai has avoided any major \"Ooops!!\" unlike Honda or Toyota. I am old enough to remember when the \"big 3\" thought the new comers from Japan with the funny names were minor irritants and could be mostly ignored...maybe the new comer from Korea shouldn\\'t be.  \"Or it could be the other way around - Saturn is making a lot of money on the lower end XE than the XR - adding a V6 and all those extras for only 2k! In most cars that offer a choice of engines (except GM/Ford whose base engines are ancient, though GM is righting that now), there is a 2-3k difference in price. I don\\'t see why you are so surprised if this is the case with the Accord as well. \"price difference between XE and XR is far more than $2k as I stated in my post. The XR starts at $25k. Ancient engines? The base engine in the Taurus is a 263hp VVT DOHC V6. The Fusion has a 160hp DOHC four with VVT. All of GM\\'s 2008 epsilon cars have a 169hp DOHC four standard that make more power than camrys standard engine. The V6 always costs more, my point is Honda is charging all that money for the engine only in the 2008 model as far as I can tell. It would be different if other equipment was bundled with the engine for that price. You will not find a $2k-$3k difference between any four cylinder and V6 domestic cars unless other equipment is included.  \"Last year 481k Americans saw this value - thousands make this decision everymonth and even more if you count Accord and Altima buyers. \"LAst year about 700k Americans decided to buy GM midsize cars. Dont see your point. Also 900k+ people bought F150s. Does that mean the F150 is twice as good as the camry? Sales numbers alone dont mean much when you break things down. As I have stated before on other threads, other automakers dont even have enough capacity for a single model to outsell Camry. Remember, Toyota (and lexus) only makes three midsize sedans- one of which is the low volume GS. Is there any wonder they sell over 450k of one model when you consider their size? On top of that they count solara sales. If Impala and monte carlo sales were added last year chevy would\\'ve been around 400k units.Impala and Malibu sold about 40k units last month which is very close to camry sales. If you add in G6, Aura, Lacrosse sales you are talking another 30k units.  heres the thing, you dont base a car\\'s \"overpriced\" factor on its brand, you base it on the competition. There is no way the Fusion, Sonata or CTS could be considered overpriced when you compare them to key competitors. The Fusion is a value compared to the Japanese cars in this class, even with its weak V6 engine. I would sacrifice 40hp to save $3k because 221hp is enought o get the job done. Anytime a loaded Fusion with nav can be had for $28k or so the car is not overpriced. Same applies to sonata. How in the world could you pay $25k for an Accord SE and then say a Fusion is worth no more than $20k? A loaded Fusion has leather, heated seats, CD changer, nav, MP3 jack, lumbar support, split folding rear seat, 17\" wheels, etc. The idea that a CTS is worth no more than $30k with all the features it has is laughable.  \"The Fusion\\'s 2.3L base engine is \"ancient\"? From what I can tell the original design is maybe 1 year older than Accord\\'s 4 cyl. \"Its only ancient in the Fusion, not the 3 or the 6 though since they are imports.  The top sellers are benchmarks. It\\'s pretty straight-forward. The mid-size sedan market is about large volume, that is the goal for the automakers. None of them have a goal of having the lowest selling model. Hence the best sellers are the bench mark. It mystifies why that is hard to grasp. If I am an engineer/ designer for Hyundai, I look at what Toyota (reliability & \\'comfy\\' handling) and Honda (reliability & \\'sporty\\' handling) are offering and I try to match their offering with whatever hook my brand represents. In Hyundai\\'s case that seems to be value, which is a good thing.Do you think the vehicles that most buyers choose NOT to buy are the more important ones?  I think the \\'08 Malibu is very competitive and can stand toe to toe with any of those three cars you have on a pedastalHas anyone actually driven the 08 Malibu? I have not seen any reviews. Maybe you have and can comment but certainly the retiring Malibu was far out-classed by Toyota and Honda.  I think one of the most if not the most important (signficant) mid-sized cars out there is the Prius. But its sales volume is quite small compared to several other mid-sized cars. Another very significant mid-sized car is the Passat. It is generally rated near the top of the mid-sized class. But its sales volume is also quite small. Does that make it an unimportant car, an inferior car? No. It\\'s been a \"benchmark\" in the mid-sized class for years. But it will never outsell cars like Accord and Camry because the dealer network is puny compared to Honda and Toyota (and Chevy and Ford and...), no matter how good it is.I have to wonder what you design at Hyundai. It is very clear to me that Honda has never been a benchmark for Hyundai (i.e. \"sporty handling\"). It is clear that Toyota/Lexus is dead-center in Hyundai\\'s target.  Since you asked:Motor-Trend quote in an article on the Accord:September 2002\"Somehow, the Accord imparts a sense that, even though it\\'s a lowly four-door family sedan, it has mechanical genetic material that responds to quality driving. That\\'s what ultimately sets the Accord apart from most everything else in the midsize-sedan universe.\"Motor-Trend comparo \\'07 Camry & \\'08 Accord:\"the Accord reigns as the best of the best-the benchmark.\"There\\'s that B-word again....From Edmunds 2003 comparison which the Accord won:\"The Honda Accord is to the midsize family sedan category what the BMW 3 Series is to the entry-level luxury sedan category. Even the manufacturers that don\\'t blatantly copy it still use it as a reference point when designing their own midsize offering.\" Most of these reviews are on the previous model but there is not much available on the \\'08 yet.  Another very significant mid-sized car is the Passat. It is generally rated near the top of the mid-sized class....But it will never outsell cars like Accord and Camry because the dealer network is puny compared to Honda and ToyotaEven CR has given VW credit, as a benchmark, where due. In the April issue they wrote:If the only things that mattered to a car buyer were performance, comfort, and safety, Volkswagen would be at thetop of the heap.In my area VW has as nearly as many dealerships as Honda or Toyota. In a 20 mile radius there are 4 VW dealers and 5 each for Honda and Toyota. The amazing thing is how few dealerships Honda and Toyota get away with, considering the volume of sales. For comparison there are 12 Ford dealers within 20 miles of me.   \"The top sellers are benchmarks. It\\'s pretty straight-forward. The mid-size sedan market is about large volume, that is the goal for the automakers. None of them have a goal of having the lowest selling model. \"So the F150 is the benchmark of pickups? Corolla is benchmark of compacts? Sales are a measure of popularity, not necessarily benchmark status. This is proven by the fact that the 2006 Camry was a best seller and was probably the 3rd best car in the segment at best. By the 2006 model year the car had been surpassed by Fusion, Sonata, Accord and Altima. Are you willing to say the Impala is the 3rd best family car on the market since sales are the most important factor?  \"Has anyone actually driven the 08 Malibu? I have not seen any reviews. Maybe you have and can comment but certainly the retiring Malibu was far out-classed by Toyota and Honda. \"this is probably why GM redesigned it. The new car and old car have nothing in common besides they are on the same platform. Improved engines, looks, features and a hybrid model. The Malibu is basically the Aura but with a better interior- and the interior and lack of 4 cylinder model where the two main criticisms of the Aura. There is nothing about Camry that \"far outclasses\" the new Malibu. Honestly, the current car wasnt even outclassed by the last gen camry. Malibu had just as much space, matched camry on fuel economy, looked no worse and the Malibu offered a 240hp engine when the camry offered no more than 225hp. Other than lack of stability the current model was just as good as 2006 camry.  \"Motor-Trend quote in an article on the Accord: September 2002 \"Somehow, the Accord imparts a sense that, even though it\\'s a lowly four-door family sedan, it has mechanical genetic material that responds to quality driving. That\\'s what ultimately sets the Accord apart from most everything else in the midsize-sedan universe.\" Motor-Trend comparo \\'07 Camry & \\'08 Accord: \"the Accord reigns as the best of the best-the benchmark.\" There\\'s that B-word again.... \"sorry but I dont consider 2002 to be recent. In 2002 the 2007 camry wasnt out, the current sonata wasnt out, the Aura wasnt out, the Fusion wasnt out. I never asked if the Accord was hte bencmark when it was brand new in 2003, I was asking where it had been rated #1 recently outside of C&D which ALWAYS rates it #1. \"From Edmunds 2003 comparison which the Accord won: \"again, not current- The Accord lost two Edmund comparos since 2003.  Like I said there is not enough out on the \\'08 Accord.  \"They are not head and shoulders above the competition anymore.\"Sure they are. Taking the complete package A-Z, they are still the benchmark. The Accord is still the vehicle that gets my dollars the next time I make a purchase in this segment.  The VW certainly moved the whole segment forward with attention to materials and detail in the Passat. They reset the bar in the market and gave the others something to work towards. The dealership networks seem to be very localized. Where I am there are 2 VW dealerships (one with a terrible reputation) but 5 -6 Honda and Toyota dealers.  \"So the F150 is the benchmark of pickups? Corolla is benchmark of compacts?\"I would pretty much think so.\"Sales are a measure of popularity, not necessarily benchmark status\"I don\\'t agree. The people have spoken. The 3 series is a good example, small manufacturer by comparision to Lexus or Nissan. Yet all variants of 3 series handily outsell the competitors.  I think one of the most if not the most important (significant) mid-sized cars out there is the Prius. I agree that the Prius is a significant vehicle and would be a benchmark in the hybrid world. It is not a benchmark in the mid-size sedan market since no one is trying to compete directly with it. It is also pretty darn small on the inside and if it had to go toe-to-toe with other mid-size sedans, the only advantage it would have is mileage. Every other metric would go to the competition.  So the F150 is the benchmark of pickups? Corolla is benchmark of compacts?Is that even a debate? The new Sierra/ Silverado may have become the new benchmark, but yes, of-course the F-150 is (or was) the benchmark. Should we have judged all light-duty trucks against the Ram??Camry was a best seller and was probably the 3rd best car in the segment at bestBy who\\'s judgment? Clearly most people found it to be their best choice!Are you willing to say the Impala is the 3rd best family car on the market since sales are the most important factor?The Impala is certainly the benchmark for mid-size rentals and fleet cars. Buyers in those industries are looking for a different set of qualities than private buyers, hence the Impala sells alot of cheap, large capacity vehicles.  I was talking about the last gen model. It hasnt been considered a benchmark across the board for a few years.  Is that even a debate? The new Sierra/ Silverado may have become the new benchmark, but yes, of-course the F-150 is (or was) the benchmark. Should we have judged all light-duty trucks against the Ram?? Bestsellers are not benchmarks. People just like them. We all know for all those years the Explorer was not the best SUV out there. Not in handling/acceleration/quality/reliability/etc. People just liked them and they were pawned as an everyman (woman)car. By who\\'s judgment? Clearly most people found it to be their best choice!That\\'s cuz knucleheaded people don\\'t try anything else. The Impala is certainly the benchmark for mid-size rentals and fleet cars. Buyers in those industries are looking for a different set of qualities than private buyers, hence the Impala sells alot of cheap, large capacity vehicles. You might be right... businesses buy them cuz they can get em cheapo. Believe it or not though, these cars are comfortable and decently reliable.  \"The Impala is certainly the benchmark for mid-size rentals and fleet cars. Buyers in those industries are looking for a different set of qualities than private buyers, hence the Impala sells alot of cheap, large capacity vehicles. \"here we go with the excuses and qualifiers. YOur argument is that sales are king but now you are saying only certain sales count. Even if we take away fleet sales the Impala would be in the top 5 in family sedan sales and ahead of Fusion, sonata and many other cars. The overwhelming majority of Impalas I see are retail. \"By who\\'s judgment? Clearly most people found it to be their best choice! \"By my judgement and many others who care about performance, features, styling, etc. The last gen camry was about as average as you could get for a family sedan. It sold a lot because the camry is the default car choice for those who know little about cars or refuse to buy anything that isnt Japanese. If sales are your only criteria, than the F150 is indeed a benchmark. If you look at features, engines, trannies, interiors, etc. the F150 is not a benchmark. In terms of mainstream V8 engines the F150 is at the back of the pack. A huge ad budget, enormous production capacity and big discounts allow it to outsell the competition though.  \"Sure they are. Taking the complete package A-Z, they are still the benchmark. The Accord is still the vehicle that gets my dollars the next time I make a purchase in this segment. \"No they are not. Name three ways these two cars are far superior to the competition without saying \"resale value\". I dont have a problem with people refusing to cross shop the camry and accord with others, but dont act like they are way better than the competition. All of these cars are very close in performance and feature content. Since the Altima tops the CamCord in hp and styling and bests the Accord by having a hybrid I am curious as to how it could be considered inferior to either.  \"I would pretty much think so. \"if you believe that than features and performance must mean nothing to you. The F150 is the 3rd oldest pickup on the market and it has been surpassed by at least two, maybe three competitors. Ford makes a lot of em and sells em cheap, but that doesnt make it the benchmark. The F150 is barely even mentioned when talking about benchmark pickups in 2007. The 3 series sells in huge numbers based on peformance, reputation and a huge model lineup. No other competitor has 4 body styles and such a wide array of engines. The 3 series is one of the FEW examples of a benchmark vehicle that outsells the competition. The RX is another example of a vehicle that has been surpassed but continues to outsell all comers.  Impala is one of the best for fleet sales. Guess that is a benchmark of sorts. L  No they are not. Name three ways these two cars are far superior to the competition without saying \"resale value\". Accord:Handling. Interior layout. Reliability. Toyota:Reliability. Smooth ride. Quiet cabin.I agree with you that none can be said to be \\'far\\' superior, this is a tight segment. Just out of interest, why do you think that resale should not be a criteria?  sorry but I dont consider 2002 to be recent. In 2002 the 2007 camry wasnt out, the current sonata wasnt out, the Aura wasnt out, the Fusion wasnt out. I never asked if the Accord was hte bencmark when it was brand new in 2003, I was asking where it had been rated #1 recently outside of C&D which ALWAYS rates it #1.So it\\'s unfair to point to comparisons when the Accord was new but not unfair to then compare that same car to newer competition?  Just out of interest, why do you think that resale should not be a criteria? Yup. In my mind, asking everyone to take resale value out of the equation is like asking to take reliability out of the equation. Once you take anything out, it\\'s not a real comparison anymore.Just a\\'visiting, not a\\'hosting.  Value. If I am ever a multi-millionaire, I still would not over pay for items. I had to work too hard over the early years, and place a higher value on a dollar than others, I guess. There is not enough of a value difference between a mid-range Camry and the top one\\'s, which have mainly fluff, I would not need, nor want. The car, the nitty-gritty specs are just the same. Go ahead and let others pay a thousand say for some gold letters which are suppose to upgrade to the next class. I say ridiculous. As for a Corvette, it looks great and goes fast. The base model is just fine. No way is a $70K car. Give me a base, or near base model of a next class up car = value, instead of maxing out on a $44K car. That is unless I am going to the track. If I was Joe racer, then yeah, gotta loosen the purse strings. A CTS for $45K =  you gotta be kidding. Look, I kinda like the odd Art & Science look of the \\'07 models, and from test drives of those earlier models, I would say it was somewhat entertaining to drive, but really now, is it say a Bimmer? Or I would call up that largest dealer of Vettes and say send one out for $45K. Nope, a CTS looks to me like a good $30K car, and I have driven some used ones for under $20K which seem just fine. Good car, but not world class. It is just interesting.Did you know a long time back now, say a decade or two, they asked millionaires, perhaps it was self-made millionaires, what car they drive. The number one car was a Crown Victoria; a used Crown Victoria. There was the perceived value. When those which were out to impress, with those new high paying Internet and computer jobs bought BMW and Mercedes, they bought used Crown Vics. Now, I must say that is a bit far to go to save a buck, but you get the idea. These people have the money for a reason -- they can spot true value.And yes, I am but a poor boy. If ever so rich as afford a new Cadillac or Vette, I would have to justify it still as a value. It would not be one with junk on it just to impress. As for a Camry, those interiors look cheap to me, and the funny nose is a bit much. I ended up with an Accord SE V6 which is their best value, and passed on even test driving the Camry. The Aura seemed like the other good car. The Fusion and Sonata, IMHO, seem like the runners up awards cars. Oh yeah, the Altima I did drive, but was not impressed. Seems overpriced too.Loren  hi Kirstie!Cars with low resale are normally low selling in the retail market, and thus the less desirable ones to begin with. It can be a precursor of things to come. Now some cars, in the high dollar, are not good resale due to those buying the cars. The high-rollers and flithy rich do not want to be seen in a used top line Mercedes say, or a Maserati, so they buy them new and dare we say, because they can do so. No one can afford to pay for those luxury cars until they fall down quite a ways in resale value, then the wannabes take charge of buying them. For the everyday Joe cars, those like the Malibu and Impala are selling in huge fleet sales amounts, and thus killing off resale hopes, which were never a strong point of the more recent history of GM\\'s and Fords. A Taurus is a dime a dozen, is it not? So resale means a heck of allot as to how people view a cars percieved, if not true value.Loren  Or you could consider the Toyota and Honda products as both different in nature, and equal benchmarks to the rest. The Camry and Corolla as good ol\\' reliable, sort of like your dog, and Honda as the quick and spunky cat. The Accord and Civic are cats.While it is important to keep an eye on what the number one, two and three are doing, being ahead of the game means coming up with the next best thing. For the domestics, I think that thing is first style, then engineering in decent fuel economy, and perfect ergonomics. Replicating the features, and how they screw together is all fine and dandy, but then you still have an \" all the rest \" sort of car. Sonata is a good car. At one time it had a more unique look to it. I think it is an example of a car which once again will do better when they venture out into the new looks, at which point they have good car, with some more captivating style. Not saying the current style is not good. It is just not grabbing the customers off the streets. I am afraid too many cars are just good enough in style. That said, what a great opportunity for the domestics. Chrysler cashed in, but had no follow through. And I am thinking the 300 had the style, and uniqueness of RWD, and AWD cars in a lower price range, but the style had this love it or hate it, or even worse I love it, but it ain\\'t so practical effect. Those too tall doors, with the chop top was confining to some, and hard to see out of for others. Perhaps if they had three good styles between three sizes, more customers would have a choice in the Chrysler line. The Charger is just another 300, at a better price, with even cheaper looking interior, and the Sebring is a disaster. The rest are lower volume specialty cars. Not sure what a Caliber is suppose to be. Does Chrysler know? They have the Charger for value. Oh well.L  \"No they are not. Name three ways these two cars are far superior to the competition without saying \"resale value\". Accord: Handling. Interior layout. Reliability. Toyota: Reliability. Smooth ride. Quiet cabin. I agree with you that none can be said to be \\'far\\' superior, this is a tight segment. \"resale value isnt a built in feature of any car. External forces determine resale value.

If two comparable cars are separated by $2k up front (in terms of price paid) and are both financed for 5 years the \"better\" car may be worth $2500 more after 5 years but what difference does it make if the purchaser of the car with better resale borrowed more money at a higer rate? Cars that cost less are going to be worth less in the end. Yes I know the rate of decline is different, but that doesnt count financing costs.Accord is no better than competition in ride quality, quietness or interior layout.

The handling of the accord is definitely not best in segment these days based on actual comments by testers and test data.  \"Unless there is another engine sludge episode\"A case of sour grapes?I wasn\\'t affected directly. However, the manner in which Toyota handled the problem made me decide that I would never buy a Toyota product ever, period. Tens of thousands of owners were affected.

The Accord and Civic are cats.If the Accord is a cat, the Mazda is a tiger :P  \"unfair\" isnt the word I would use. I would say its pointless to say the Accord is the current benchmark and then use 5 year old comparisons to back that up. Competition changes a lot in 5 years.

Accord is no better than competition in ride quality, quietness or interior layout. The interior layouts of 90% of cars is similar and logical these days.

Note- I didn\\'t claim the Accord was best in quietness.However, while I agree that certain cars may be better than the Accord in ride quality (Mazda?), Reliability (really none, maybe Toyota) or interior layout (Passat), no car can put all 3 together better than the Accord.People who brag about resale value dont note that they are based on MSRP\\'s not transaction prices.Nonsense. Did you see what happened to GM and Ford\\'s resale when they started doing zero interest and putting all kinds of rebates out there? They lost value even as the MSRP stayed the same.Regardless of what they are based on, resale is a very quantifiable number. Whether you disagree with their methodology, Kelly Blue book, Edmunds etc. all have resale numbers that are industry standards. Try going to trade in your car and tell them that you want them to use YOUR preferred method and not Kelley Blue Book! You\\'ll be laughed out of the room.When I go to trade I know exactly what I expect to get based on how I have treated the car appearence-wise and what the blue book is on the car.  \"1. The overall fit and finish of the Accord. 2. The overall smoothness of the Accord. 3. The overall styling (okay this is subjective) \"styling is subjective so you can rule that out but I will say many do not agree with your assessment.I dont know how you define \"smoothness\" but I assure you most cars in this class are sufficiently refined and quiet. Just look at the noise level measurements in any test. Fit and finish is close across the board these days. You can claim the Accord has superior fit and finish but a quick walk through a mall parking lot will show you that there is no dicernable difference between brands in this regard. Even Hyundais have great panel fits these days. Reliability is also good across the board. CR gives data that says the Accord is VERY reliable while other cars are simply reliable. Bottom line is that most of these cars are not going to have major problems within 5 years or more. when you factor in the superior warranty you get with most other brands I think I am more than willing to take my chances with them.  \"Regardless of what they are based on, resale is a very quantifiable number.

Secondly, I didnt say you should use a different method to calculate resale- what I said was the ACTUAL difference to YOUR pocket is much smaller than indicated by KBB resale values. What about financing costs? If you borrow more money that is money you dont have to put other things. Unless you are paying cash for your car any savings you will get on the back end are absorbed during the time you are making payments. Interest is not your friend if you want to save money. I fail to see how buying a more expensive car and taking on more debt is a good way to \"save\" money in the end. \"However, while I agree that certain cars may be better than the Accord in ride quality (Mazda?), Reliability (really none, maybe Toyota) or interior layout (Passat), no car can put all 3 together better than the Accord. \"its pretty obvious that your are an accord cheerleader and will not be realistic about the car\\'s merits. The Accord isnt even known for a plush ride and you are telling it its possibly the best riding car in the class. The accord has long been criticized for having a somewhat stiff ride compared to Camry and some domestic competitors. I dont have a problem with the interior layout of most cars in this class and the Accord is nothign special. You are saying its the \"clear\" leader based on subjective matters. when you look at the facts- price, performance, features, warranty, etc the Accord is OK but not stellar. The Accords best attribute is resale value if you are a person who buys cars strictly based on what they will be worth at trade in.  A loaded Fusion has leather, heated seats, CD changer, nav, MP3 jack, lumbar support, split folding rear seat, 17\" wheels, etc. That\\'s great that the Fusion has all those features, but just because it can match other cars in features, doesn\\'t mean it matches in quality or value. the leather could be cheap low grade thin leather, the heated seats might be unreliable, the CD changer might have a low signal to noise ratio, the 17\" wheels might be heavier with a lesser finish than other 17\" rims. I would sacrifice 40hp to save $3k because 221hp is enought o get the job done.That\\'s great that a heavy oversized 220 HP engine is good enough for you, but why not get 40 HP more and get better mileage to boot?Or why not just get 170 HP with a light 4 cylinder and get much better mileage. 170 HP will get the job done just as well, and save you that $3K.  Another very significant mid-sized car is the Passat. It is generally rated near the top of the mid-sized class. But its sales volume is also quite small. Does that make it an unimportant car, an inferior car?Yes, the answer is yes, the Passat is an inferior car when it comes to durability, reliability, and dependability. If it was as \"good\" as the Camry and Accord in those areas, then it would sell just as much (or right in between) the Camry and Accord (provided they don\\'t raise the pricing)  Did you see what happened to GM and Ford\\'s resale when they started doing zero interest and putting all kinds of rebates out there? They lost value even as the MSRP stayed the same.Well of course it did. Because if I bought car X for $25,000 and 3 years later they have the same MSRP but now have a $3K rebate then my 3 year old car is worth at least $3K less, maybe more. However, the depreciation on the new car that was purchased at $22,000 with the rebate will be basically the same after 3 years, provided the rebates don\\'t increase. Conversely a decrease in rebates would provide better resale values for the older vehicle.Large rebates and rental fleet dumping are only necessary if you build more vehicles than the public wants to buy. This used to be the strategy at the domestic automakers because it was cheaper to do that than to reduce production or close plants because the autoworkers got paid either way.Ford\\'s inventory levels are so low this year that they cancelled the normal labor day sale, instead they\\'re only doing the normal model year closeout sale. They\\'re learning and it will show in the new 09 Fusion out next year.  just traded in a car and I can tell you KBB wont get you far at a dealership so good luck if you think that is your saving grace.That depends on the car. If you buy a car that isn\\'t in high demand or has a lot of discounts, that typically will figure in to trade in value as well (although retail seems immune). Trading in a less desirable model - which the dealer will likely end up auctioning or wholesaling, will bring back of book value.  That\\'s cuz knucleheaded people don\\'t try anything else. Or more likely the case, they found the Camry to be better built and of higher quality (leading to long term reliability) than the other competing models. Also, Camry\\'s ride very nicely on the straitaways, very comfortable and luxury-like. Not everyone\\'s cup of tea, but a lot of people like that when combined with reliability.  you will not see any domestic or Korean car outselling the camry anytime soon, probably never. Its not going to happen. The competition has to worry about taking some sales from Camry and Accord and increasing share. People often say Honda and Toyota \"dominate\" the midsize car segment but thats BS. The domestic brands dominate the pickuup segment, but you cannot say the same for camcord. You can say that they outsell the nameplates they compete against.Frankly GM has gotten its midsize cars together and they are only going to get better. Ford and Chrysler are just doing OK and have some work to do. Hopefully the 2009 fusion will address that car\\'s weaknesses. The Chrysler cars have impressive levels of equipment but need more V6 power and better styling.  its pretty obvious that your are an accord cheerleader and will not be realistic about the car\\'s merits.This discussion began when you stated that the Accord was not a benchmark in the class. Since we are discussing the various perspectives that (IMO) make it a benchmark, it would not make a lot of sense for me not to think it\\'s a bench mark right?I chose the phrase \\'ride quality\\' carefully because I do not believe that plush is a sign of great ride quality. Ride quality is a balance of confident road holding and handling without beating the occupants up. That may have some subjective elements to it. If you prefer a soft ride then that would explain a lot of your down-playing of the Accord\\'s influence in this class. If you value saving money up front, again, that explains your perspective on the car. That\\'s neither right or wrong, but you and I do not have the same goals with our vehicles obviously.just traded in a car and I can tell you KBB wont get you far at a dealership so good luck if you think that is your saving grace.So how was your trade in valued? I assume you knew what the value would have been in KBB, was it higher or lower? Were you expecting sale price and got wholesale? If it was not on KBB, why not? You are in a big market- a dealer has no reason to come off of the industry standard.FWIW, I absolutely expect KBB wholesale to be the minimum price offered when trading unless the car has exceptionally low miles/ wear or exceptionally high mile/ wear. If it is lower, the dealership doesn\\'t want my trade and I move on, and if I can get higher, great.  Since the Altima tops the CamCord in hp and styling and bests the Accord by having a hybrid I am curious as to how it could be considered inferior to either. Last I checked, the Accord did come in a Hybrid variant, so no advantage for Altima there. Styling wise, I don\\'t really care for Nissan\\'s spaceship designs with cheap looking tail lights. The 3 ways Accord and Camry leave everyone else in this segment in the dust are:Reliability, Dependability, Durability, and not only that, but build quality, material quality, & engineering quality.  \"That\\'s great that the Fusion has all those features, but just because it can match other cars in features, doesn\\'t mean it matches in quality or value. the leather could be cheap low grade thin leather, the heated seats might be unreliable, the CD changer might have a low signal to noise ratio, the 17\" wheels might be heavier with a lesser finish than other 17\" rims. \"that was an incredible reach. The excuses are unlimited I see. I measure value by what equipment you get for your dollar. I would love for you to explain how a car with less features and a higher price is a smarter by for the consumer. The Fusion is well equipped for the price of a poorly equipped Accord V6. That is a fact, not something that can be debated. Now if someone is unwilling to live without 244hp and stability the Accord may be worth thousands extra. If you can do without those things the Fusion is a good buy. \"Or why not just get 170 HP with a light 4 cylinder and get much better mileage. 170 HP will get the job done just as well, and save you that $3K. \"dont get this part at all. You could get a Fusion I-4 and save thousands over an Accord/Camry I-4 model. you also mention \"40 more hp\" but the current accord only has 23 more hp than the Fusion. I think the Accord\\'s mileage is about 1mpg better than the Fusion. In reality the Fusion V6 competes with the i-4 camry and Accord in price. If you want mileage that may not matter to you but if you want performance the V6 will outperform the 158hp camry and 166hp Accord easily.  People often say Honda and Toyota \"dominate\" the midsize car segment but thats BS.Who does?  accord hybrid is done right about........now. 2008s are out, there is no more Accord hybrid. I am not a huge fan of the Altima\\'s styling but to those who only shop Japanese its the most stylish of the trio. \"but build quality, material quality, & engineering quality. \"any measure of any of those factors? probably not which is why its pointless to make absolute statements that hinge on those attributes. The panel gaps on camry and accord are no better than anything else in the segment. In fact, I find the fit on the current camrys trunk to be lackluster due to the complex faux BMW shape of the decklid. Unless you have a way to quantify how those cars are better in materials (that is a joke considering the new camry\\'s interior), build quaity and engineering I would suggest you come up with some more meaures of superiority. This is not the 80s or 90s, Toyota and Honda do not have fit/finish that blows away the competiton anymore. Engineers and designers are pretty smart people- if given the authority and money to develop high quality parts that can be assembled with tight tolerances they will do so. The top brands when it comes to gap tolerances are German- they are noticable better than lower priced brands but even the mainstream brands are very good.  the media says it quite often. I just read an article about the new Malibu that makes that statement. You cant dominate any segment in which you dont sell the most vehicles last time I checked. Toyota loses the sales crown in midsize sedans by a sizable margin and Honda loses it by a large margin.  when you factor in the superior warranty you get with most other brands I think I am more than willing to take my chances with them. You might be willing to roll the dice and take your chances with them, but most people are not willing.I don\\'t want to have to use a warranty, it\\'s a huge hassle, even with the best of customer service.  \"Also, Camry\\'s ride very nicely on the straitaways, very comfortable and luxury-like. Not everyone\\'s cup of tea, but a lot of people like that when combined with reliability. \"Buicks do the same thing but I dont hear anyone calling them the greatest things since sliced bread. Its interesting that Toyotas benchmark cars drive much like the American cars of old that have been so criticized by import fans and the media. Toyota is building its own version of Buicks and people love them. If Buick builds a Buick people call it an old man\\'s car.  \"You might be willing to roll the dice and take your chances with them, but most people are not willing. I don\\'t want to have to use a warranty, it\\'s a huge hassle, even with the best of customer service. \"since most midsize buyers do not by an Accord I would beg to differ. The sales totals of all the cars you are deriding far exceeds Accord sales so I\\'m not sure where you get this idea that \"most\" buyers chose the Accord or Camry. No one likes repairs on their car but I fail to see how its a huge hassle unless you live 50 miles from a dealership. I would say 90% of what goes wrong with todays cars can be fixed at an oil change, I\\'m not talking blown trannies or cracked axles. GM and some others give you a loaner car if needed. If my car causes me to need 2 more warranty repairs (at oil changes) than the average Honda and saves me $30 a month for 5 years I am willing to take that trade off. BTW, its no roll of the dice. If you read CR\\'s details instead of just looking at those silly circles you will see that CR tells you (only in the annual auto issue) that problem rates amongst US and Asian brands are VERY close and there isnt much difference between them. You are acting as if buying anything other than a Honda is going end up with you stranded on the side of the road. do you read Edmunds LT testing? They rarely take any vehicle in for a repair unless they are going in for scheduled maintenance. I think the last long term vehicle they had that left them stranded was a Pilot. Imagine that.  Toyota\\'s ride nice and soft, whereas Buicks I\\'ve been in ride floaty, barge/boat like soft. I don\\'t think Toyota\\'s are as extreme as Buicks, but still provide the same level of comfort w/o losing some stability. Also, the NEW V6 2008 Accord does have more than 40 HP over the Fusion. And it looks like it\\'ll have an advantage in 2008 EPA ratings as well. That would be an example of superior engineering.  So manufacturing capacity and number of stores have nothing to do with units sold? The fact that, for example, one company has capacity to turn out a maximum of, say, 150,000 units a year compared to another that can turn out 500,000 units a year with more than twice as many stores to sell them makes no difference? The higher-volume car must obviously be superior? Sorry, that doesn\\'t make sense to me. Doesn\\'t make sense to the folks at CR also, who rated the Passat turbo the top I4 family sedan and the Passat V6 the top V6 family sedan (tied with Accord). And they recommend the V6 based on its reliability and safety. The turbo I4 must be less reliable than the V6, since CR did not recommend the turbo.  If your lucky it\\'ll be something you do at oil changes, but then who\\'s going to pay overpriced oil changes at dealerships all the time when you could do it for half the price at Jiffy Lube?Also, Edmunds LT tests are really just shorterm tests, and the vehicle aren\\'t ever kept for much more than 12 months or 20,000 miles, right? If the LT tests were for like 5 years and 100,000 miles, that would be more telling.  You cant dominate any segment in which you dont sell the most vehicles last time I checked.So if it\\'s not the Camry and it\\'s not the Accord, what is the best selling mid-size sedan?  \"I chose the phrase \\'ride quality\\' carefully because I do not believe that plush is a sign of great ride quality. Ride quality is a balance of confident road holding and handling without beating the occupants up. That may have some subjective elements to it. If you prefer a soft ride then that would explain a lot of your down-playing of the Accord\\'s influence in this class. If you value saving money up front, again, that explains your perspective on the car. That\\'s neither right or wrong, but you and I do not have the same goals with our vehicles obviously. \"ride quality and sportiness are not the same. I am not one for Lexus like isolation in a car. The Accord is neither the sportiest car in this class nor is it the smoothest riding. Its in the middle somewhere. It doesnt ride softer than the Lacrosse or camry and its not as sporty as the Fusion, Altima or Aura. Its right in the middle.we need to separate the accord from being your fave car from it being the benchmark. Its obviously the former and obviosuly not the latter based on any objective evaluation. I think people who refuse to drive the competition are the first ones to put the accord on a pedastal. Until you drive the best of the rest you dont know whats out there and you go on believing Honda has a magic formula. You cannot force a dealer to give you KBB value- trust me. My brother and I both traded in cars recently and it does not work. Dealers have a lot of explanations, some of which are legit, as to why they are not going to hand over what KBB says. My car was not in demand but my brother\\'s car was and he still got a grand less than KBB value. Its not as easy as you make it seem. Furthermore different sites give different numbers so you have no solid reliably data. I saw values froom $6100-$8000 for my car online.  If I told VW today that I was willing to buy 400,000 base model Passats at 30K each, and forked over an advance of 25% of the money, I bet they would sign the contract and find/obtain/acquire the capacity to build them within the next year. Capacity means nothing, if the demand is there, the supply will find a way.  \"So if it\\'s not the Camry and it\\'s not the Accord, what is the best selling mid-size sedan? \"let me try to be more explicit here. You have to look at TOTAL sales of all brands. Domination is what the big 3 have in the pickup market- they sell about 90% of the pickups in this country. Accord and camry are best sellers but those cars do not dominate the midsize car market. They cant when GM sells more midsize cars than either Toyota or Honda. The G6, Malibu and Impala alone reprsented around 600k sales in 2006 which is more than Accord by a large margin and above Camry by a significant margin. Those two nameplates are very successful and top the sales charts, but their combined sales do not equal domination of the market. You can make the argument that civic and corolla dominate the compact market because those two vehicles single handedly make up a huge chunk of that overall market.  Another very significant mid-sized car is the Passat. It is generally rated near the top of the mid-sized class. But its sales volume is also quite small. Does that make it an unimportant car, an inferior car? Yes, the answer is yes, the Passat is an inferior car when it comes to durability, reliability, and dependability. If it was as \"good\" as the Camry and Accord in those areas, then it would sell just as much (or right in between) the Camry and Accord (provided they don\\'t raise the pricing)Given the number of 10-15 year old VWs I see cruising around in the midwest, and the number of 20+ year old VWs on the west coast, I would say their durability is fine.I would be more concerned with the durability of a contemporary BMW with so few maintenance requirements.  we need to separate the accord from being your fave car from it being the benchmark. Its obviously the former and obviously not the latter based on any objective evaluation. I think people who refuse to drive the competition are the first ones to put the accord on a pedastal.Just so we\\'re clear, when I bought my car in \\'06 I cross-shopped Fusion/ Milan/ Accord/ Mazda 6/ used MB C-class/ used BMW 3-series. I went with the Accord with leather, v6 and 6-speed manual because none of the other vehicles had a combination of reliability, manual, v6, cost and mpg that the Accord put into one vehicle. I did not cross-shop Camry (or Buick for that matter) because I don\\'t want that handling and manuals do not come with leather.You can\\'t force a dealer to give you kbb, but you can go to another dealer.  If your lucky it\\'ll be something you do at oil changes, but then who\\'s going to pay overpriced oil changes at dealerships all the time when you could do it for half the price at Jiffy Lube?Jiffy Lube oil change - $32Dunning Subaru oil change - $234qts 5w30  \"Toyota\\'s ride nice and soft, whereas Buicks I\\'ve been in ride floaty, barge/boat like soft. I don\\'t think Toyota\\'s are as extreme as Buicks, but still provide the same level of comfort w/o losing some stability. \"You havent been in recent Buicks. The lacrosse is no more floaty than a Camry or Pruis. The models with the firmer suspension are likely more firm than camry. Same goes for Lucerne- only the base suspension model offers a \"traditional\" Toyota soft ride.\"Also, the NEW V6 2008 Accord does have more than 40 HP over the Fusion. And it looks like it\\'ll have an advantage in 2008 EPA ratings as well. That would be an example of superior engineering. \"Accord has better powertrain than Fusion and it should considering its $2k+ price premium over Fusion. The new accord actually does have close to class leading V6 mileage which is good since the current car is just midpack.When it comes to I-4 mileage the new Accord is just on par with camry and GM models. The malibu with I-4 and 6 speed should slightly exceed accord I-4\\'s mileage.  You have to look at TOTAL sales of all brandsWhy do I have to look at the total sales of all brands? If I want to know what the top selling mid-size sedan is, I want to know what the top selling mid size sedan is. It is irrelevant that between 3 different vehicles, GM has more sales than Toyota has in 1 vehicle.  \"You can\\'t force a dealer to give you kbb, but you can go to another dealer. \"the market not the dealer determines ultimate value of car. My brother got a quote from another dealer that was almost exaclty what the first offered. Unless you have extensive experience getting KBB values with no fuss from the dealer I\\'m not sure why you are arguing this point. Dealers know about the internet and they are not going around handing out checks for KBB values with no questions asked. \"I went with the Accord with leather, v6 and 6-speed manual because none of the other vehicles had a combination of reliability, manual, v6, cost and mpg that the Accord put into one vehicle. \"well if you only wanted a 6 speed and V6 combo your options were limited to Altima, Accord and 6. As for reliability- I guess you plan to keep your car for 10 years because you may have to keep it that long to see any differnce in quality. I hear a lot of talk about the \"inferior\" quality of Accord competitors but I\\'m curious as to what proof we have of this beyond CR\\'s little circles.  \"If I want to know what the top selling mid-size sedan is, I want to know what the top selling mid size sedan is. It is irrelevant that between 3 different vehicles, GM has more sales than Toyota has in 1 vehicle. \"Let me remind you the question was about Toyota and Honda dominating the midsized market. Not best sellers. The media (and you apparently) use top sellers and marketshare dominance as if they are interchangable when they are not in this case. The companies with smaller share of any segment cannot be considered the dominant players in that segment. Its pretty simple.  Hopefully the 2009 fusion will address that car\\'s weaknesses.What weaknesses?  \"Also, Edmunds LT tests are really just shorterm tests, and the vehicle aren\\'t ever kept for much more than 12 months or 20,000 miles, right? If the LT tests were for like 5 years and 100,000 miles, that would be more telling. \"you and I both know its not realistic for publications to do 5 year tests. Most LT tests in magazines cover between 30k and 40k miles in a 12-18 month period. Sorry but that is plenty of time to go wrong although the whole \"let see what happens after 100k miles\" is a typical cop out answer amongst people who wont accept the quality gap is shrinking. I dont keep many cars for over 100k miles so to me its not even a big deal and I\\'m going to avoid a model because it might only be trouble free for the first 75k miles of ownership. I read that people keep their cars 6 or 7 years on average. Most people are barely making it to 100k miles before trading. you are making a lot of statements and accusations but I see no proof to back up your claims that anyone who buys a brand other than Honda or Toyota is taking a major risk. Do you have any information about major engine or tranny or electrical issues at other brands? Since Chrysler offers a lifetime powertrain warranty I would say thats a good sign they feel their cars can go the distance. any excuses for that?where\\'s Honda\\'s lifetime powertrain warranty? where is Honda\\'s roadside assistance? And dont say \"they dont need it since they dont break\" because it offers assistance for more than just mechanical failures. BTW, you better hope your Honda doesnt have a problem since the tow will come out of your pocket.  Nobody pays more than the 19.99 coupon price at Jiffy Lube, those coupons are more common than, well...... Camry\\'s and Accords.  lack of V6 power, lack of stability, lack of manumatic, interior design/materials. This is all well documented in road tests.  well if you only wanted a 6 speed and V6 combo your options were limited to Altima, Accord and 6.My 2006 Fusion has a V6 and 6 speed.  I am speaking of manual trannies- the accord has no 6 speed auto.  Your original comment:You cant dominate any segment in which you dont sell the most vehicles last time I checkedI should have realized that what you were referring to was most vehicles with the same frame because Toyota and Honda do sell the most of their vehicles.Again, I am not a domestic basher or a Japanophile. I would have happily bought domestic if they had impressed me as much when I was buying. Also, I have never had to accept less than KBB wholesale for any car I have traded (inc Saab, Isuzu, Jeep, Acura, Nissan and Infiniti- enough variety that I do not accept the idea that the dealer sets the standard).I do think that the Accord and the Camry define the segment currently. Since more Camrys are sold than any other model and more Accords are sold than any other model except the Camry, I would describe them as dominant players.Do you believe that manufacturers look to the G6 or the Impala for inspiration?  Yes, I will bet that VW would love to sell you 400,000 base Passats at a big premium over MSRP. But whether they would be able to ramp up plant capacity within a year is questionable. Look at Toyota a few years ago. They had lots of hungry buyers waiting over a year for a Prius, and they were willing to spend MSRP or over to get them. Yet it took them a couple of years to ramp up more capacity. Why not deal with more realistic scenarios? Do you know anyone who will offer to buy 400,000 mid-sized family cars at a big premium over MSRP and pay a $3 billion advance (interest free, of course)? I don\\'t.  What assistance would the average \"not dumb\" person need for roadside assisstance other than for mechanical failures (which we\\'ve established is unnecessary for Honda\\'s)???Nobody could handle living with a Chrysler POS car for more than a few years, so that\\'s why they can offer a lifetime warranty which is really only a 3/36K warranty unless you meet about 45 specific conditions, requirements, catches, hooks, lines, and sinkers. So much fine print tells me they don\\'t believe for a second their cars will go the distance. Also, you should ask Chrysler where you should get your warranty service when they go bankrupt? Is there a secured account somewhere that may only be used to pay off warranty claims? Has this secured account been funded properly (10K per vehicle would be proper if you ask me for a Chrylser).Have you received answers to these questions?The average car buyer might only keep their car less than 6 years or 100K miles, but they should still care how it performs after they own it!!!! Why? because the 2nd owner will care! And that second owner cares because they are not going to pay for a junker. The amount the 2nd owner cares about how your car runs after 6 years or 100K miles affects your resale value DIRECTLY, which will greatly influence your bank account.  My example was an example, of how supply will meet demand, given enough sustained demand, or enough high dollar offers. If VW didn\\'t have the plant capacity, then they could buy or build new plants fast tracked, then start pumping out more Passats, all probably within 10 months. Or they could pay some other auto plant to retool to build Passats instead of Jettas, or even Passats instead of Audi\\'s, or even pay Honda to start making Passats in Ohio..... Given enough money, all are possiblities.  I am speaking of manual tranniesYeah, I know. I just hate it when people say 5 speed and 6 speed instead of manual.  \"I do think that the Accord and the Camry define the segment currently. Since more Camrys are sold than any other model and more Accords are sold than any other model except the Camry, I would describe them as dominant players. \"Let me try one more time. Accord and Camry are dominant nameplates in the segment. Toyota and Honda are not the dominant players in the midsize segment. TOyota is a strong second but GM is the leader in midsize car sales. Its great that the camry is the best selling car but at the end of the day all of GM\\'s various models represent a sale for ONE company. all of the camrys sales represent a unit sold for ONE company. GM offers different styles and names to get sales why Toyota pushes one car for all buyers and thus Toyota can sell 400k of the same car. I would be lying if I told you I thought that GM models its car after the camry. They may aim for camry reliability but thats about it. When it comes to syling and handling I would say GM is most definitely not trying to out Camry the camry. I dont think Chevy is too worried about the Impala since its going to rack up over 300k sales this year and it outsold the accord a few times this year. What would make you think other brands (including Nissan) wouldnt want the Impala\\'s sales? Isnt it whipping the sonata, 6, Passat and Fusion in sales right now? There are only going to be three midsize cars that crack 300k sales this year and one is Impala so I\\'m not sure how you figure GM doesnt have a recipe for success with that car. The opinions of the press and import leaning domestic bashers is one thing, what the marketplace says is another. seeing as though Nissan and Hyundai are selling cars to rental agencies left and right I do get tired of the whole \"impala is only doing well because of fleets\" argument. If sales are all you care about than the F150 is the best vehicle in the country, period. And the Silverado is the 2nd best. Their sales make the Camrys sales look modest.  so if Toyota buys GM then Toyota would be the dominant midsize manufacturer, but the Camry would STILL be the dominant mid-size car. At least for now....  \"Nobody could handle living with a Chrysler POS car for more than a few years, so that\\'s why they can offer a lifetime warranty which is really only a 3/36K warranty unless you meet about 45 specific conditions, requirements, catches, hooks, lines, and sinkers.\"that was one of the worst cop out excuses I\\'ve seen in a while. Anything but acknowlegde that Chrysler is standing behind their product. The powertrain is covered as long as you get the car checked every 5 years- its so simple anyone can do it. we can either base our evaluation of the warranty on what chrysler says in the fine print- or we can base it on your erroneous statement in the previous post that has no backing. There go those pesky facts again, funny how they ruin those rants of yours. If you think chrysler is going bankrupt I suggest you do some more research. I\\'m sure Jim Press took that job because he feels Chrysler is on the verge of collapse. Until recently Chrysler was responsible for the majority of the profits generated by DC because the Germans had made so many dumb decisions regarding the Smart car and other things. Chrysler was doing better than Mercedes in terms of profitability. I dont think Cerberus is in the business of taking over companies that are headed for bankruptcy. roadside assistance is like AAA coverage. Check it out- everyone but Toyota and Honda have it. They will come out for flat tires, dead batteries, etc. Oh wait, Hondas never get either one.  I do get tired of the whole \"impala is only doing well because of fleets\" argument. Sorry you get tired of it but, just like resale, it is a quantifiable arguement.If sales are all you care about than the F150 is the best vehicle in the country, period. And the Silverado is the 2nd bestNo, they are the bench marks in the light-duty (and heavy-duty) truck segments. Additionally they are benchmarks for total vehicle sales. Actually going by your perspective the GM twins are the best selling trucks because it\\'s the leader with all the vehicles it brings to the sector. It\\'s pretty clear we disagree on the definition of a bench mark vehicle. I think the \\'benchmark\\' is a vehicle that sets the standard in a segment, it\\'s a combination of all the things which customers tend to buy for and has powerful influence on all competitors. I truly do not understand what you consider a benchmark to be.You and I will have to disagree on what makes a leader in a particular segment. I understand that you consider sales by manufacturer in total to have more impact than sales per vehicle, I disagree with that. Fair enough.  What assistance would the average \"not dumb\" person need for roadside assisstance other than for mechanical failures (which we\\'ve established is unnecessary for Honda\\'s)??? My experience to the contrary.Nobody could handle living with a Chrysler POS car for more than a few years, so that\\'s why they can offer a lifetime warranty which is really only a 3/36K warranty unless you meet about 45 specific conditions, requirements, catches, hooks, lines, and sinkers. So much fine print tells me they don\\'t believe for a second their cars will go the distance.Also, you should ask Chrysler where you should get your warranty service when they go bankrupt? Is there a secured account somewhere that may only be used to pay off warranty claims? Has this secured account been funded properly (10K per vehicle would be proper if you ask me for a Chrylser).Have you received answers to these questions? Hmm I wonder if they would pay the chiropractor for services for those that have a bad back from the chip they carry on their shoulders every day.  I disagree, the quality of the materials in the more upscale versions of the Accord is better than some of the competitors.  Take out the fleet sales and what do you have? Factor in profit per car, and what do you have? The Impala is a full sized car, is it not? Are you saying the total of all the Epsilon platform cars is greater than the sales of Camry? Guess that may be possible, with massive fleet sales and discounting. And they may be able to sell more cars than Accord. Whoopie, who cares. GM, Ford and Chrysler need profit -- real profit, and to reduce their debt load. Some help, near term, could come in the form of the Feds lowering rates. Someday this all changes. If rates ever hold to the higher numbers, those bonds are gonna get pretty darn pricey. Hope labor is willing to take serious cuts in wages and pay for their own health care, or domestics are in big trouble going forward. We have seen but the tip of the iceberg.I see the term used again, \" domestic bashers \" in reference to the media opinions on cars, or those here on the forum. Time to wake up and face the music, the dreamland World is over. Domestic cars, like all the rest, must all compete and excel to win. This \" mommy, everyone is calling me names, and those bullies are not being fair \" is just all so much wasted time. You, \"lead, follow, or get out of the way\" and nothing more. No more excuses, as your dog did not eat your homework. No more, I will have it done tomorrow and it will be better.Sorry but tomorrow is more like today, or is that yesterday for getting your act together to compete in the car World. GM is showing a few sparks, there is hope for fire, but is there a steady flame yet?L  Are really REALLY making me tired. I just read through 55 messages (skipping several along the way). Let me know when we get out of this debate about market domination and trying to prove each other wrong, and get back to the vehicles\\' attributes with a little less drama. :sick: Really, do the sales numbers etc.. really matter THAT much?  Don\\'t get me started Grad.... BTW, it\\'s \\'benchmarks\\' not \\'sales numbers\\'...benchmarks.  And EVERYBODY has different benchmarks, because EVERYBODY will have a different desire for each characteristic of each car.It\\'s starting to smell like bloody dead horse around here...  \"where\\'s Honda\\'s lifetime powertrain warranty? where is Honda\\'s roadside assistance? And dont say \"they dont need it since they dont break\" because it offers assistance for more than just mechanical failures. BTW, you better hope your Honda doesnt have a problem since the tow will come out of your pocket.\"It\\'s not that they don\\'t break, it\\'s that I don\\'t care whether a car has a lifetime powertrain warranty. (They don\\'t need it, because in general they don\\'t break.)  Jiffy Lube, isn\\'t that Pensziol oil and filters? My first change was $34, I think it was, at Honda. Didn\\'t break the bank to do so, but I have paid much less  I\\'m a little cheap, ya know. L  I JUST got my oil changed in my \\'96 today at Wal-Mart. With oil & filter change, battery test, tire pressure/tread depth test (all of which I get the results of), a windshield wash and interior vacuum, and brand new wiper blades installed, I was out the door for $33 after taxes (the blades were $5.46). The oil change is $25.96 and includes everything but the blades.For $39 at my dealership, I\\'d get fresh oil and filter, nothing else.  AAA for towing. Great insurance company too!As for warranty work, the local dealership can supply you with a car. It is not required though by warranty. There are all sorts of dealerships in the World, and over time you find the good, the bad and the plain ugly ones. I don\\'t think they need to go to a lifetime warranty for powertrain. I would want to see any such warranties finest print. Overall, I would say the warranty provided by Honda could be improved however. Like any car I buy, if it sucks over the years, it is basically gone anyway. So if it becomes a dog for two to three years, by the time the warranty is nearing an end, I would be out of it anyway. All cars can have problems, and personally I think they should add to and adjust some things in the Honda warranty. Lifetime warranty??? Nahhh, sound like one of those too good to be true. A five year bumper to bumper is a good thing. L  If there is no limit to sales, why don\\'t Honda and Toyota ramp up to sell twice as many Accords and Camrys? Just click their fingers, and *poof*, over 400,000 more sales each per year. They have plenty of money, after all. Or they could pay VW to make cars in Brazil or Germany, or Hyundai to make cars in Alabama... the possibilities are endless.  You can also get an oil change there for $16.85, I think it is -- the base service. Wonder what Pep Boys is charging. They use Purolator filters. Perhaps it is still Pennzoil for the oil? Anyway, couldn\\'t hurt to have the dealerships record the changes while under warranty, and if they screw up, they replace the engine. Some dealers let you take your oil, or synthetic in and a filter of choice, and then charge you for the labor. I wonder how happy they are with that :blush: L  \"Let me try one more time. Accord and Camry are dominant nameplates in the segment.\"Let\\'s say it this way. WRT to the vehicles only on this board Accord and Camry are the benchmark. With respect to all mid-size vehicles Accord and Camry are the benchmark. Although one can say GM sells more cars than Honda and Toyota, Accord and Camry garner the most sales in the entire segment. Does Pontiac sell more G6s\\' than Accords?  \"No one likes repairs on their car but I fail to see how its a huge hassle unless you live 50 miles from a dealership. I would say 90% of what goes wrong with todays cars can be fixed at an oil change\"It wasn\\'t just the need for repairs on my brand new 2004 $29k MSRP Ford, it was the general ownership experience that turned out to be a huge hassle.Examples of me enjoying my new Ford...- Wanting to back into a parking spot, I stop and shift into reverse, wait a second, then move from the brake to the gas. The engine revs freely, with no vehicular movement, and then BANG! It finally jolts into gear and off shoots backwards. The dealer puts a transmission additive in, which has little effect.- I\\'m just crusing down the road with my foot on the gas. The engine is lazily turning 2,000 RPMs. Suddenly, the car in front starts slowing down, so I let off the gas, and BANG! the transmission jolts into neutral, feeling like I have just run something over. The dealer can\\'t ever seem to replicate the problem.- I wake up to go to work, get in the car and try to crank it. The starter chugs along, but the engine just won\\'t catch. I try this several more times. I swear at it. I consider lighting it on fire. Instead, I wait a few minutes and try it again. It finally coughs back to life with a very rough idle. I keep my foot on the gas and wait a minute just in case. Again, the dealer can\\'t find anything wrong. \"There are no trouble codes in the computer.\" At least, each time this happens, I\\'ve got a few months before it happens again.These are just three examples... Sure, it was rated average in CR, and probably only has a couple more problems than a top-rated car; but living with it every day was a pain- and forget being fixed at oil changes, the dealer couldn\\'t ever fix it, period! Now I drive a new Honda, and (knock on wood) it has no such quality issues. I bought the Honda partly because it has less of a chance of ever being such a nusiance to own.  Toyota & GM gives you guys what they want you to have.Ford is dead, but they don\\'t know it yet.The oil companies just keep getting richer and nobody can unseat a member of congress and life goes on.  What weaknesses?  you have goota be kidding - ALL these cars as well as ALL others have weaknesses. Even the generally acknowledged leaders can be rightfully cited for higher initial costs, hard to cope with dealers, somewhat subjective styling evaluations etc. The Fusion(and to a lesser extent the 6)? What is under the hoods,4 and 6 cylinder, obviously the biggest points. If they are good enough for you is not the point, they do not measure up to what can be found in several of these cars from either a HP or FE standpoint. In my own case, for example, Ford could reduce the price of a V6 Fusion to $10k and I would still pay the extra $15k or so for what is in a Camcordima (or even a Sonata) - such is the value I put on drivetrain sophistication (or lack of it).What you personally \\'value\\' may be different, which of course is fine - but ALL these cars have quantifiable weaknesses  Well the cheapest service didn\\'t have a price beside it; but I could really stand to have new blades and my car vacuumed.Wal-Mart uses a Fram filter and Castrol.  Sorry about the late reply, between work and kids I don\\'t have alot of computer time. Yes I bought 17\" wheels and I haven\\'t figured out what I am going to do with my old 16\" wheels(sitting in the corner of the garage right now). I have my 1995 Pathfinder for bad weather so I don\\'t need them for snow tires. May end up trying to sell them eventually.  ALL these cars as well as ALL others have weaknesses.Well I certainly agree there is no such animal as a perfect automobile, mid-size or otherwise. Some are just better than others. Some sell better than others. Some get higher ratings than others from reviewers. Etc., etc.Except for poor in-city gasoline mileage, we like our 2007 3.0-liter V6 SEL AWD Ford Fusion just fine.  there is no doubt that Toyota controls the car business a position they earned by making better quality cars and correctly understanding that the American car buyer prefers \\'big and soft\\'. GM, OTH, is only just beginning to understand that they really need to buy their funeral plot as well. And as \\'life goes on\\' it is not even close to what Bill Gates does to us everyday!  Your Fusion delivered advertised figures on the highway which translates to the fact that it\\'s not the car - its your route and driving style (short trips are a key factor here).There\\'s not much room to blame Ford for that, when your 2.0L Focus didn\\'t do much better than 20 MPG.  Some get higher ratings than others from reviewers. Etc., etc.  and some mfgrs. have PAY for those reviews (or survey results) - the engine differences I was talking about are not differences however that can really be disputed and, yes, it is good that you are happy with your DT. For my part I doubt seriously that I would spend the money to insure your car after you gave it to me! Such is my personal distaste for that particular engine (and FTM the GM pushrods). As I said, we all have different values and priorities.....  Last year 481k Americans saw this value out of 4 million midsize cars sold. apparently there are a whole lot more people who don\\'t see the value   , there is no car (in any segment) that as exclusive features. CVT  They arn\\'t really discounting the atlima much. a little bit more on the remaing 07\\'s though. when I bought mine in feb, nissan wasn\\'t offering dink. just 500 for college grads. at the end of the summer they added 500, but thats about it.  :mad: The powertrain is covered as long as you get the car checked every 5 years- its so simple anyone can do it. WRONG!!!! :mad: The powertrain isn\\'t covered EVEN if you check it in every 5 years with them, UNLESS you are the first and original owner (please let us know why this is 1487), and UNLESS you make that 5 year checkup requirement within a very tiny 30 day window (why isn\\'t this window of opportunity a more reasonable and appropriate 180 days?) The whole Chrysler warranty smells of rotten rebate deals where you can only get your rebate check if you mail it in between the dates of the 13th and 15th of the month, only if those two days fall on a Tuesday or Thursday, and anything before or after is no good.  roadside assistance is like AAA coverage. Check it out- everyone but Toyota and Honda have it. They will come out for flat tires, dead batteries, etc. Oh wait, Hondas never get either one. I suppose even Hondoytas can get flat tires or dead batteries, but at least with the Honda you won\\'t have a dead battery when the car is brand new; it should last you 50 months. As for flat tires, that\\'s what the spare is for, change it yourself!  If there is no limit to sales, why don\\'t Honda and Toyota ramp up to sell twice as many Accords and Camrys? Just click their fingers, and *poof*, over 400,000 more sales each per year. They have plenty of money, after all. Or they could pay VW to make cars in Brazil or Germany, or Hyundai to make cars in Alabama... the possibilities are endless. Wait a minute, your turning this whole thing around from the original point you were trying to make (incorrectly) You were trying to assert that the reason the Passat doesn\\'t sell as well as the Accord or Camry is because they don\\'t have the \"capacity\" to make 400,000 of them a year, and/or they don\\'t have enough dealers. To which I pointed out that logically, they\\'d \"find a way\" to make 400,000 of them a year if they had customers willing to pay for them. The thing of it is, that if they made 400K, they wouldn\\'t sell any more than what they currently sell, without further discounting...  Hmmm, I suppose it\\'s possible to be exclusive in this segment with \"negative\" or \"bad\" features.I suppose Chrsylers have a whole lot of exclusivity when it comes to falling apart.  for being \"negative\" or bad, its driving altima sales in the neighborhood of +20%  Given that it is a first year redesign, Altima sales BETTER be up 20%.Anyway, I\\'m not saying CVT is a bad thing... I haven\\'t driven one yet, though I have ridden in one, and it seemed smooth enough; I\\'d have to drive it to make my own conclusion about CVT. My initial thought is that they seem to not put up very good 0-60 times (which are better with the manual), but are good in the FE department.  we need to separate the accord from being your fave car from it being the benchmark. Its obviously the former and obviosuly not the latter based on any objective evaluation. When a car company decides to design their next midsize sedan it makes sense that they would try to emulate (benchmark) some of the qualities that make the top selling midsizer\\'s (Camry/Accord) \"benchmarks\" so popular. Do you actually think any car company is looking to emulate the Malibu when designing a new midsize car?You cannot force a dealer to give you KBB value- trust me. My brother and I both traded in cars recently and it does not work. Dealers have a lot of explanations, some of which are legit, as to why they are not going to hand over what KBB says. My car was not in demand but my brother\\'s car was and he still got a grand less than KBB value. These cars were obviously not a Camry or Accord.  \"The Fit\\'s magic seats are certainly unique in its class, and a distinguishing feature--whether it alone makes the Fit the benchmark for low-end cars is debatable. And Stow-and-Go is certainly a unique feature. And having standard ESC is an important feature--but one that the Accord does not have for its class, btw (Sonata beat it to the punch by 2-1/2 years).\"As usual you digress when you have no facts. The discussion was about benchmarks and what makes them. Does a magic seat make a Fit the benchmark? No. Does standard ESC make Elantra a banchmark? No, far form it.As for the Sonata beating the Accord - only in your wildest dreams.  \"Actually just C&D. I would love for you to find the last comparison test the Accord won in another publication. MT, Edmunds, Motorweek and others do not consider the current car the benchmark. MT just gave the new model a SLIGHT edge over the Camry SE but the newest car in the segment is often the best for a short time. The Current Accord is a good car in a field of good cars. Its design, performance and mileage were all about average and its feature content/value equation were below average\"The current Accord won most comparisons it was featured in, inlcuding ones on CD, RT, MT, AW etc. These ranged from the time it debuted till recently. In the recent MT comparison that you quote, did you note the title of that comparison of the 08 Accord vs 08 Camry? It was \\'battle of the benchmarks\\'. I am sure you would have noted it, bit surely you wouldn\\'t mention it here, right?  I am no fan of Fram, but the way I understand it those used at the dealerships are Fram. Is that really true in all the dealerships though? So they are using Castrol GTX at your Wal-Mart. Sounds better than Pennzoil, to me anyway. Looks like ya gotta deal. Wish they used Purolator or Wix (NAPA Gold) filters, which are some of the best. L  \"I did not say FACTORY REBATES, I am saying the actual selling price of a camry is $3k+ under MSRP these days.\"Cmon, no one buys at MSRP and carmakers know that. Most sales happen close to inovice price, unless of course you are talking exotics. Why single out the Camry for transaction prices below MSRP?  \"Ancient engines? The base engine in the Taurus is a 263hp VVT DOHC V6. The Fusion has a 160hp DOHC four with VVT. All of GM\\'s 2008 epsilon cars have a 169hp DOHC four standard that make more power than camrys standard engine.\"Yes, the Taurus aka 500 has a new engine now (3 yrs after the car\\'s introducion). For most of its life, it had an ancinet engine.Do all of GMs cars have the new or recent engine? How about the 3.8l that keeps powering a lot of its base cars?  Pontiac G6 sales to fleets seem to top those of Accord :P  \"LAst year about 700k Americans decided to buy GM midsize cars. Dont see your point. Also 900k+ people bought F150s. Does that mean the F150 is twice as good as the camry? Sales numbers alone dont mean much when you break things down. As I have stated before on other threads, other automakers dont even have enough capacity for a single model to outsell Camry. Remember, Toyota (and lexus) only makes three midsize sedans- one of which is the low volume GS. Is there any wonder they sell over 450k of one model when you consider their size? On top of that they count solara sales. If Impala and monte carlo sales were added last year chevy would\\'ve been around 400k units. Impala and Malibu sold about 40k units last month which is very close to camry sales. If you add in G6, Aura, Lacrosse sales you are talking another 30k units.\" You are pitting ALL GM midsizer numbers against one Toyota model? Wow! Are all those GM cars the same cars (no difference between a chevy or buick or pontiac?)? In any case, how many of those cars were sold to fleets?Your F150 analogy is totally incorrect and baseless. According to you the F150 sells more because of high rebates (higher than its competitors). Assuming that is true, how can you align that with the Camry success story? If the Camry was selling so well because it offered the highest discounts/rebates/incentives and was the cheapest out there, one could relate it to your F150 story. The actual fact is different - the Camry is more expensive than most of its competition; it still sells more.  Just saw an ad by a large Mazda dealer in Chicago and the price advertised for the 6i VE auto went up about $630. They were advertising and selling at 16,595 with a sticker of 21,225. Now they are advertising 17,225. The rebate of 1750 is the same and was just renewed until Oct something. Since it\\'s the end of year, does anybody know why the price has risen instead of going down?  \"So the F150 is the benchmark of pickups? Corolla is benchmark of compacts? Sales are a measure of popularity, not necessarily benchmark status.\\'Is the Corolla the cheapest car in its category? Is that why it sells so well?\"By the 2006 model year the car had been surpassed by Fusion, Sonata, Accord and Altima.\"By what standard had the Fusion, Sonata, Altima and Accord surpassed the Camry? Expecially the rental queen, Sonata? Rebates?  Well there is an Epsilon with more HP from an i4, with a turbo, in the SAAB 9-3. Ah, the King Epsilon! So, is the Epsilon SAAB 9-3 more GM than SAAB or vise versa? I was wondering about the price being around $27K, which ain\\'t so cheap, yet for a Scandinavian model, it is not so expensive, if ya know what I mean. Then I noticed the platform is that of Epsilon GM. Hummm? Just curious. Wonder if the car outperforms the Aura XR 3.6V6 in overall handling, road manners, stopping power. Is there such a thing as the coolness factor :shades: L  \"There is nothing about Camry that \"far outclasses\" the new Malibu\"This is the pits - even without driving the Malibu, you already are all praise for the car? Did you even need to see pictures or had you decided that it was a great car as soon as GM announced there would be a redesign?The previous Malibu was a POS - the worst of the GM lot. GM has been on the right path in the past couple of years, and I am one of the group who believes that GM will be back, looking at the current prodict (Aura, Outlook/Acadia/Sky etc); but really, the Malibu was one of its weakest cars. Good that it is being replaced now.  \"you will not see any domestic or Korean car outselling the camry anytime soon, probably never. Its not going to happen. The competition has to worry about taking some sales from Camry and Accord and increasing share. People often say Honda and Toyota \"dominate\" the midsize car segment but thats BS. The domestic brands dominate the pickuup segment, but you cannot say the same for camcord. You can say that they outsell the nameplates they compete against. Frankly GM has gotten its midsize cars together and they are only going to get better. Ford and Chrysler are just doing OK and have some work to do. Hopefully the 2009 fusion will address that car\\'s weaknesses. The Chrysler cars have impressive levels of equipment but need more V6 power and better styling.\" The Camry and Accord do dominate this segment - they are hte two largest selling single models in the category. Which Chrysler midsizers are you talking about? The new Sebring?  \"You cant dominate any segment in which you dont sell the most vehicles last time I checked. Toyota loses the sales crown in midsize sedans by a sizable margin and Honda loses it by a large margin.\"What exactly is your point? You are saying that since the Accord and Camry don\\'t sell more than 50% of all midsizers, they don\\'t dominate the segment? This is a ridiculous statement. These two cars are at the top of their segment; clearly they dominate. Ask Hyundai, GM, Ford etc what they wouldn\\'t do to get these types of sales for their individual models and without being rental queens.  \"Buicks do the same thing but I dont hear anyone calling them the greatest things since sliced bread. Its interesting that Toyotas benchmark cars drive much like the American cars of old that have been so criticized by import fans and the media. Toyota is building its own version of Buicks and people love them. If Buick builds a Buick people call it an old man\\'s car\"Buicks also used to have poor quality interiors, poor fit and finish and poor reliability. Its only recently they have been picking up - but perception takes time to change.  I must say, while driving your Camry, while taking a quick look in the rear view mirror, you could be shocked at first by a Fusion. After all, the Gillette Fusion massive chromed shaver grill, at first glimpse could be looking to shave your car --- oh how scary it looks!All kidding aside, the Fusion, looks wise, is better overall than is the Camry. Other than the big butt, the Fusion and Milan are attractive when they are are compared to mid-sized cars in looks, in the sub- $30K field. I would take the razor front over the blistered nose. LP.S. After seeing the new CTS, I am thinking the Fusion/Milan have a cleaner modern car look to them now. The CTS is busy up front now, confused in the middle, and the rear is not the crisp neat styling they once had. That said, the Milan is not RWD. *Is 1487 sleeping???*  As usual, typically hypocritical. You quote CR and other publications when they suit your argument - run them down when they don\\'t.  \"let me try to be more explicit here. You have to look at TOTAL sales of all brands. Domination is what the big 3 have in the pickup market- they sell about 90% of the pickups in this country. Accord and camry are best sellers but those cars do not dominate the midsize car market. They cant when GM sells more midsize cars than either Toyota or Honda. The G6, Malibu and Impala alone reprsented around 600k sales in 2006 which is more than Accord by a large margin and above Camry by a significant margin. Those two nameplates are very successful and top the sales charts, but their combined sales do not equal domination of the market. You can make the argument that civic and corolla dominate the compact market because those two vehicles single handedly make up a huge chunk of that overall market\"That\\'s a great new spiin. Now you are combining all GM sales of mid and near full size cars and saying they dominate the segment and not the Camry/Accord? Sure they dominate - the rental lots.GM goes to great lengths to differentiate the cars from its different divisions - you are doing the opposite. Is the malibu and the G6 the same car? Is the Lacrosse and Impala the same car? If GM were to close all divisions except, would they sell a million Impalas? Its all spin 1487, and you know it  \"Toyota and Honda are not the dominant players in the midsize segment. TOyota is a strong second but GM is the leader in midsize car sales. Its great that the camry is the best selling car but at the end of the day all of GM\\'s various models represent a sale for ONE company. all of the camrys sales represent a unit sold for ONE company. GM offers different styles and names to get sales why Toyota pushes one car for all buyers and thus Toyota can sell 400k of the same car.\"Keep spinning it - you are doing well  As a Honda owner and supporter, I have to say that in my experience, Honda batteries are embarrassingly poor. And the dealership always has a premium on the prorated warranty replacement battery, and just enough of a special on a battery not eligible for warranty, that the 72-month (or whatever) warranty is useless after a few years...just as mine typically go bad.It\\'s a racket, and I no longer even consider buying replacement batteries from them.  \"If there is no limit to sales, why don\\'t Honda and Toyota ramp up to sell twice as many Accords and Camrys? Just click their fingers, and *poof*, over 400,000 more sales each per year. They have plenty of money, after all. Or they could pay VW to make cars in Brazil or Germany, or Hyundai to make cars in Alabama... the possibilities are endless.\"They would if they could sell more than 400-500k, but they can\\'t. Not because they can\\'t make so many, but because they can\\'t sell 800k copies each. VW would love to sell 400k copies of their Passat, but can\\'t - and not because they can\\'t make them. Why would Honda ask Hyundai to make cars for it? Or Toyota, VW?  \"out of 4 million midsize cars sold. apparently there are a whole lot more people who don\\'t see the value \"Were there 4 million midsizers sold last year? Assuming yes, what car sold the most, that too at prices higher than most of its competition? Are Americans idiots? The Camry, Accord and Altima are the most expensive (not counting the Passat) in their segments, still are at the top of the charts. Mean anything about domination?This is like saying that the #1 bestselling album is nothing, since there are millions who didn\\'t but that one.  \"CVT\"Does that make it a benchmark?   Also 900k+ people bought F150s. Does that mean the F150 is twice as good as the camry? Sales numbers alone dont mean much when you break things down.Sales numbers mean nothing, when comparing a Truck to a Car. Trucks are bought because most people have to have a truck to haul things. Trucks are sold in large numbers to companies as work trucks. When talking about Full Size Trucks vs. Midsize car sales numbers you have to consider the number of choices. How many Full Size Trucks are there to choose from, and how many choices do you have in Midsize Sedans. There is an Astromical difference here. :confuse: :confuse:Impala and Malibu sold about 40k units last month which is very close to camry sales. If you add in G6, Aura, Lacrosse sales you are talking another 30k units. Adding all these \"5\" cars sales numbers together to compete with \"1\" car is rediculous. Toyota only had to design 1 car to compete with 5 different designs for GM. No wonder Toyota is coming out on top (where it counts) in PROFITS.  Doesn\\'t anyone change their own oil anymore? The only time I\\'ve had someone change my oil is when the dealer gave me free oil changes when we bought our Pilot. Just curious.  Honda battery -- It\\'s American. The battery is made by Johnson Controls. Good ol\\' Honda USA brand.  You know if I was hunting for a battery, I would just go to Wal-Mart. They put them in at no charge and prices seem right. L  Doesn\\'t anyone change their own oil anymore?If you want it done right, do it yourself.   \"There is nothing about Camry that \"far outclasses\" the new Malibu\"This is the pits - even without driving the Malibu, you already are all praise for the car? Did you even need to see pictures or had you decided that it was a great car as soon as GM announced there would be a redesign?This is funny. I recall an earlier post where 1487 used a phrase similar to \"import leaning domestic bashers\". Based upon a claim of superiority for a car that isn\\'t even on the market yet, that\\'s rich. Must be a \"domestic leaning import basher\".  Well I for one, do not. Why mess with it? You buy the oil and filter, then you crawl under the car, and hope you can reach the filter, then into the pan goes the oil, then into a container for oil pickup, which you have to remember to place out on a certain day, then you clean up the catch pan, and then yourself, and then the oil in the driveway. Well I am sure I left some of the fun out of the adventure, but you get the point. It save perhaps $8 to $10 tops - big deal for all the woes. I did it when I was a kid, but no more. L  You know if I was hunting for a battery, I would just go to Wal-Mart.Yes, there are only a few different battery making companies, with hundreds of different labels on them. I got my new battery (with more power than the original) from Sam\\'s Club for $45, and installed it myself. Easy as pie.  \"CVT\"Does that make it a benchmark?The Subaru Justy had a CVT ten or more years ago. Do you remember it? Not many do. Doesn\\'t look like CVT is that big a deal.  Ah yes the Justy, bigger than a bread box, smaller than a Mini Cooper. Let\\'s see the holder of the patent for CVT, is that Leonardo da Vinci ? L  Why would Honda ask Hyundai to make cars for it? Or Toyota, VW?I really have no idea. I also have no idea why VW would ask Honda to make cars for it, or why someone would pay VW way over MSRP and $3 billion up front for 400,000 Passats that VW doesn\\'t have capacity to make. :confuse: But maybe you could explain it to me, since you didn\\'t question any of that reasoning.  As usual you digress when you have no facts. The discussion was about benchmarks and what makes them. Does a magic seat make a Fit the benchmark? No. Does standard ESC make Elantra a banchmark? No, far form it.I stated facts. You get personal. To each his own.The post I made was in response to the statement that no car, in any class, has a unique feature. I was simply pointing out that isn\\'t true, and I gave several examples to back it up. Do you agree with the original statement that was made, then, that no car, in any class, has a unique feature?And I was quite clear that whether or not the magic seats make the Fit a benchmark is debateable. And I never said the Elantra was a benchmark. Please re-read my post if you don\\'t recall what I said.And like it or not, the Sonata did beat the Accord, as I stated, by 2-1/2 years in making ESC standard across the lineup. It was the first mid-sized family car to do so, back in early 2005. It\\'s a fact; you can look it up if so inclined. Or you can just keep taking swipes at people who try to use facts instead of insults to make their points. Up to you.  STILL? SERIOUSLY?  Some people have to work all day. Then check in here and find 1000 new posts (or thereabouts).  Elantra, did someone mention the Elantra. A pretty nice looking car. Wonder how it would sell in a buffed-up version with the Sonata engine? Anyway, like you mentioned loads of standard equipment on those Hyundai cars. I wonder if people are just waiting another year or two to see if the quality rating hold true and the comeback kid is for real? The car certainly is one of the nicer ones in its class. For a coupe, I do like the Civic. In a sedan style, this Elantra is very good. I have seen some priced upwards or over $17K, but we all know Hyundai prices are negotiable to a somewhat higher degree downwards than others in class. Seems like a value and style car in one. Loren  Apologies to all those who didn\\'t get to experience the joy of the \\'benchmark debate\\'. As with most of these debates, it ended with neither side changing their opinion. Funny that.  They could have checked the dictionary : BENCHMARKIt would have saved some time.just trying to me helpful, Loren  No - my Starfire had the 3 speed automatic in it. Had the un-even firing V6 that liked to gallop at low speeds. The Starfire was peppy though and got great gas mileage.I guess I\\'ll be looking at GM and Ford stuff next year - it\\'ll be time to replace my business driver and I\\'m not buying another Chrysler. My last 2 Sebrings have been awful. Before all you Honda and Toyota fans get all excited - the dealerships for both that are close to me are simply awful, and, I won\\'t deal with them.Regards:OldCEM  Oh I do wish I would have tried out a Starfire before buying one with the awful clutch. I could have gotten an automatic, or better yet, a better car.So, you are shopping GM & Ford for a mid-sized car. GM has the New Malibu and Aura XR, which are two to start with in my view. Ford has the Fusion / Milan which are pretty good lookin\\' gals. I did not go up the scale far enough to try out the SAAB, but it may be a good car. You mentioned it is for business, so perhaps it is too pricey. As company cars go, perhaps the Impala has some good points to it. Or maybe even a Sonata, if you have Hyundai nearby. For price and something, shall we say very different looking, I even considered a new or used Monte Carlo, which is deep discounted. Oh yeah, any Ford FiveHundred left will be deep discounted. And the new one, with the alias Taurus has the new engine, which is an improvement. Let us know what you find. And enjoy the hunt !L  1.\\ta standard of excellence, achievement, etc., against which similar things must be measured or judged2.\\tany standard or reference by which others can be measured or judgedbenchmark for value - Sonatabenchmark for handling - Mazda6benchmark for versatility in hauling - Passat/ Mazda6benchmark for safety - Legacybenchmark for big schnoz - Camrybenchmark for exageration - andres3benchmark for referees - gradand according to accordman et al, the benchmark for benchmarks - Accord (and Camry cuz it sells the most)  \"It save perhaps $8 to $10 tops - big deal for all the woes.\"You can save a whole lot more then 8 to 10 dollars by doing it yourself. My brother-in-law had his oil changed at one of the big name chain places (Jiffy Lube I think) and they cross-threaded the oil pan plug when they put it back on. The oil leak that resulted from this incompetence meant that in a short period of time there wasn\\'t enough oil left to lubricate anything. End result.. ruined engine. Jiffy Lube said \"Gee.. that\\'s too bad.\"  Sorry about the late reply, between work and kids I don\\'t have alot of computer time. Yes I bought 17\" wheels and I haven\\'t figured out what I am going to do with my old 16\" wheels(sitting in the corner of the garage right now). I have my 1995 Pathfinder for bad weather so I don\\'t need them for snow tires. May end up trying to sell them eventually.No problem, I appreciate the response. Thats kind of what I figured, the 16s can be used to keep someone\\'s yacht from floating away.I am going back and forth on whether to wait two or three years and then take advantage of the Accord\\'s \"excellent resale value\" and get something I like, or modify the suspension and tire/wheel fitments to make it something actually enjoyable for me.  Doesn\\'t anyone change their own oil anymore? The only time I\\'ve had someone change my oil is when the dealer gave me free oil changes when we bought our Pilot. Just curious.Yeah, its amazingly easy on the Subaru. The filter is mounted upside-down at the bottom of the motor, and the drain plug is right there too. Drain the oil, pull the filter (the oil is drained so it doesn\\'t leak all over), replace filter and plug and refill.  That wasn\\'t a direct post at you, backy... I just can\\'t beleive this is STILL an issue, because it\\'s completely subjective. Seems like more people would realize that, and stop trying to force opinions on others (again, not a direct shot to you backy, just my general opinion).  Doesn\\'t anyone change their own oil anymore? The only time I\\'ve had someone change my oil is when the dealer gave me free oil changes when we bought our Pilot. Just curious. Nope, the time to change the oil myself is more valuable than the $25 and 15 minutes it costs to get it done at a place like Wal-Mart. I can kill two birds with one stone because EVERYBODY needs something at Wal-Mart at some point lol. Everybody on a college budget anyway!Besides, I\\'m not the least bit mechanically inclined. I changed my own air filter, cleaned and oiled a corroding battery terminal, and can change a tire. That\\'s about it as far as my maintenance experience goes.  When you think about it, this entire discussion is completely subjective.   I do my own because I enjoy it, I know that it was done right and it\\'s more convenient for me.  \"Sorry you get tired of it but, just like resale, it is a quantifiable arguement. \"Its not an argument, its a fact that has no bearing on whether or not the Impala is a good buy. The Impala is successful for many reasons. The fact that its sold to fleets is only a negative in the minds of those that dont want to give Chevy any credit.

Where are you getting your facts?  \"benchmark for value - Sonata benchmark for handling - Mazda6 benchmark for versatility in hauling - Passat/ Mazda6 benchmark for safety - Legacy benchmark for big schnoz - Camry benchmark for exageration - andres3 benchmark for referees - grad and according to accordman et al, the benchmark for benchmarks - Accord (and Camry cuz it sells the most) \"exactly, there is no benchmark across the board in such a competitive segment. I like that benchmark for exaggeration. LOL!  \"Its all spin 1487, and you know it \"Not really. You are failing to understand the fact that these sales all go back to the manufacturers. A camry is a Toyota. An ES350 is a Toyota. The G6, Malibu, Aura, etc. are all GM cars. The NAME of the cars is irrelevant. If Toyota is so smart and is \"dominating\" they should be selling more midsize cars than GM. They are not and nothing you say can change that fact. GM is probably outselling Toyota in midsize cars by a good 30% so I fail to see how Toyota is dominating the segment. Thats not spin, its fact.The majority of people who buy a midsize sedan do NOT buy a Toyota or Honda and thats all you need to know when making an argument about segment domination. I dont see it getting better for them with all the strong entries coming out such as the 6 and Malibu and 2009 Fusion. \"Is the malibu and the G6 the same car?\"Yes. Malibu, Aura and G6 are the same car underneath the skin just like camry and ES350. Lacrosse, Impala and Grand Prix are the same car underneath as well. GM only has two midsize platforms for non luxury cars, not that it makes a difference. as for rental lots- GM\\'s midsize sales would be much higher if they cranked up the rental sales to previous levels. The Malibu and lacrosse for example have taken significant hits in monthly volume due to reduction in fleet sales. There was a time when the Malibu was selling at around 20k units a month before GM cut back on fleet sales.  \"Keep spinning it - you are doing well \"I would love for you to explain how selling less cars equal market domination. Now THAT my friend is some serious spin if I\\'ve ever seen it.  \"Adding all these \"5\" cars sales numbers together to compete with \"1\" car is rediculous. Toyota only had to design 1 car to compete with 5 different designs for GM. No wonder Toyota is coming out on top (where it counts) in PROFITS.\"Toyota has 3 brands and GM has 7. Could that be why GM has more than one midsize car? I dont know, you tell me. GM cant just give all their product to one brand and starve the rest. I\\'ve never known consumer choice to be a bad thing. I for one am glad we have so many choices in this segment. BTW, since you dont believe in making multiple cars off the same platform to generate more sales I guess you dont like the fact that TOyota makes the camry, ES350 and Avalon when really only one car would do. Guess you dont like Honda making the Accord, TSX, TL and RL off the same platform either. More brands equals more cars, its not rocket science. BTW, GM really only needs two cars to match camry sales. If you subtract Solara (which is really a different nameplate although Toyota uses it to boost camry sales #\\'s) the Malibu and Impala usually match camry sales.  \"This is the pits - even without driving the Malibu, you already are all praise for the car? Did you even need to see pictures or had you decided that it was a great car as soon as GM announced there would be a redesign? \"Folks, I am not telling you anything new here. The Aura has been highly praised and the Malibu is an evolution of that car. IS anyone here willing to take bets on how the Malibu will be reviewed? If you take a solid car and correct its deficiencies you end up with a very good car. The Malibu is only an unknown entity to people who have had their head in the sand when it comes to recent domestic entries- the Aura has been out for year. BTW, I have seen the Malibu in the flesh at my local autoshow. If you are aware of any glaring issues with the new Malibu let us know since you are convinced that its totally new vehicle that could be a complete disaster. Please note I dont bash imports, I just state facts that others seem to ignore. There are no \"bad\" cars in this class or any class for that matter in 2007. We are way beyond that stage although I see many here are stuck in the 80s when it comes to perceptions.  \"These cars were obviously not a Camry or Accord. \"One was a mazda3 which is a model that is in high demand. I know what I\\'m talking about. If the dealer doesnt want to give you KBB they will not, its that simple. The dealer even told my brother they were excited about getting the car and knew it would sell quickly. Bottom line is they plan to make a certain amount off the car and they are only going to give you whatever that amount is minus $1500 or so. \"Do you actually think any car company is looking to emulate the Malibu when designing a new midsize car? \"I dont think they are looking at Camry when redesigning a midsize car, thats for sure. Other brands want the camrys reputation, but other than that there is little to emulate. Should they emulate the gooseneck trunk hinges? should they emulate the odd pairing of options that mean the SE model doent offer a split folding seat or auto climate control? Should they emulate the hood prop that Toyota uses instead of a gas charged strut? Should they be looking to copy the hard plastics in the interior? Maybe the fact that stability isnt standard on any models? Or maybe the fact that that Toyota gives you smaller wheels on the top model even though it costs more? The only noteworthy things about the 2007 camry are the hybrid model and the mileage of the V6 models.  \"The current Accord won most comparisons it was featured in, inlcuding ones on CD, RT, MT, AW etc. These ranged from the time it debuted till recently. \"Name two comparos outside of C&D that the Accord has won. I do not recall the Accord ever being in a R&T comparo. Autoweek did a comparo between the Aura and \"benchmark\" camry earlier this year and picked the Aura. The Accord wasnt invited. Edmunds had the Accord losing two comparos in the last couple of years. Where are you getting your information? \"In the recent MT comparison that you quote, did you note the title of that comparison of the 08 Accord vs 08 Camry? It was \\'battle of the benchmarks\\'. I am sure you would have noted it, bit surely you wouldn\\'t mention it here, right? \"I saw the MT article. The Accord was compared to camry because MT loves the camry and named it COTY. They were comparing the accord to the CURRENT benchmark in the segment. They werent indicating the 2007 model was a benchmark. I dont even think it was included in the last midsize car comparo they did because at that time they considered it surpassed.  \"Cmon, no one buys at MSRP and carmakers know that. Most sales happen close to inovice price, unless of course you are talking exotics. Why single out the Camry for transaction prices below MSRP?\"are you serious? I have heard so many statements about domestic cars and rebates and transaction prices that I cant believe you are now arguing that nothing is wrong with a car needing $4k in discounts to sell. People like you would be the first ones to say GM or Ford \"needs\" cash on the hood to sell a car because their cars are so crappy. Now you are telling me \"they all sell for invoice\" and its no big deal. I have read many times that if a car is made right and demand is there you dont need discounts and rebates. Toyota and Honda were always held up as the examples of how to perfectly balance price and demand. I guess that isnt the case with the camry. Toyota had to be on crack to allow the Camry to reach $34k loaded unless they planned to offer discounts from the door.  I think we have sufficiently established that everyone has their own idea of what represents the benchmark in this segment and it\\'s time to stop beating it beyond death. Please.  \"Yes, the Taurus aka 500 has a new engine now (3 yrs after the car\\'s introducion). For most of its life, it had an ancinet engine. \"The duratec wasnt ancient, it was just too small and underpowered. That engine came out in the mid 90s- hardly old by engine standards. The old Taurus with the 3.8L engine had an ancient motor. \" How about the 3.8l that keeps powering a lot of its base cars? \"A lot? That engine powers 3 vehicles and it makes more power and torque than Chryslers DOHC 2.7L which is a much more recent design. I agree the 3800 needs to go, but the majority of GM\\'s products dont have that engine. None of the cars I named have it, thats for sure. Truth be told its not even a bad engine for a car that starts around $23k like the Lacrosse. An accord with the new 2.4L engine will make 190hp and sell in the same price range as the lacrosse so I dont see the big deal. for reference, the epsilon cars are the Malibu, G6 and Aura. That is why I said the EPSILON cars have the 2.4L 169hp engine standard.  \"By what standard had the Fusion, Sonata, Altima and Accord surpassed the Camry? Expecially the rental queen, Sonata? Rebates? \"honestly I am starting to wonder if you read about any of the cars we are debating. By 2006 the camry was THOROUGHLY surpassed in power, transmission, features, performance and style. The 2006 Sonata was better than the 2006 camry. The Accord was WAY better than the 2006 camry.  \"The previous Malibu was a POS - the worst of the GM lot. GM has been on the right path in the past couple of years, and I am one of the group who believes that GM will be back, looking at the current prodict (Aura, Outlook/Acadia/Sky etc); but really, the Malibu was one of its weakest cars. Good that it is being replaced now. \"care to back that up? The Malibu wasnt pretty but it could compare favorably with the 2006 camry in every way. It had the same space, fuel economy and performance. In fact the SS model offered better performance than the Camry SE. Aside from its rental lot popularity there isnt much about the Malibu that wasnt comparable to the last gen Camry. If you have any facts to support why the car was a POS let me know.  \"What exactly is your point? You are saying that since the Accord and Camry don\\'t sell more than 50% of all midsizers, they don\\'t dominate the segment? This is a ridiculous statement. These two cars are at the top of their segment; clearly they dominate.\"first of all the camry is being sold to rental lots.Secondly if you dont understand how a manufacturer cant dominate a segment without leading in sales I dont know what to tell you. A nameplate alone cannot dominte- you have to look at total sales. In that measure Honda and Toyota lose. What does \"dominate\" mean to you? Apparently not what it means to the rest of us. If you want to reduce things to the platform level we can, GM\\'s W platform cars outsell the camry and yes they are the same car underneath regardless of styling and brands. I would say GM sold about 550k W platform cars last year. There is your domination from ONE platform. as I said, the domestic brands dominate the pickup market with about 80% share. I dont think Accord and camry have 80% share of midsizers.  huh!???I guess you don\\'t understand then how the Hertzs, Avises, Enterprises, muncipalities, and larger corpoations etc. \\'buy\\' their vehicles. These cars are not sold at all, they are simply furnished by whoever is willing to lose the most money on them on a bid basis- and one good reason why \\'Detriot\\' continues to lose beaucoups of money. So next time you see a G6, Malibu (or a Sebring) on the road without a green \\'E\\' on it, or can find an Impala (midsize?) that isn\\'t white think you finally have found a car that was actually may have been sold and a car may have helped that mfgr. with some real profit and didn\\'t ultimately cost some Americans their jobs!And furthermore mfgr participation in these farcical \\'sales\\' really really hurts not only a particular model resale values but also the mfgrs. overall reputation. The new Taurus is already having to be discounted and rebated despite now being relatively competitive in its class and well \\'sticker\\' priced. IMO, a mistake on Ford\\'s part going back to a name that to many of us means rental car!in short something about 800,000 Camcords are sold every year to folks like you and me for a profit- and maybe (if you include the Impala) along with your g6s, malibus, auras etc you might be able to come up with a number higher than that BUT sales and production are 2 different things!  *Beats head on wall*Looks like its time to remove my Track from this discussion. This benchmark $#!& has gone on WAY too long. The host has asked that it stop. The sales figures probably belong in \"News and Views.\" I remember the good old days when we talked about engines, handling, and actual attributes of the cars...too bad.  If I recall it might be the now defunct Dutch auto company DAF who tried to use them long before the computer technology existed to make the concept viable. Yeah, after further thought it was DAF who first (to my knowledge) used it in a fwd car called the \"Daffodil\". BTW I also believe BMW bought out this and some other smaller auto companies around the same time (1960-62 maybe).  Has anyone read a road test for the 2008 Accord with a 190hp I-4? If so what was the consensus of opinion about its performance? Documented numbers in the standards: 0-60. 1/4 mile etc??  I would LOVE to know those #s.  As I\\'ve stated about 5 times, GM dominates the segment regardless of how many brands it takes to do it. GM sells about 70k-80K non luxury midsize cars a month. Dont think Toyota or Honda match that number.You keep mixing manufactures and models. I don\\'t share your view GM dominates the segment. The view I have is the models in this segment are dominated by Accord and Camry. While GM has a mix of models across a number of divisions that may be labeled mid-size, none of them really comes together as well as the Accord. Does GM sell more cars than Honda? Yeah, but so what.  If VW didn\\'t have the plant capacity, then they could buy or build new plants fast tracked, then start pumping out more Passats, all probably within 10 months.Right.Being a Civil Engineer, I can tell you from experience that you\\'d be lucky to get the PERMITS for these new plants within 10 months, let alone construction of the building itself (whether new or renovations of existing plants), setup and tooling of assembly equipment, etc.You\\'re looking 2-3 years MINIMUM.  Huh. I must have missed that, because the Camry as a whole is a better (imo) car than the Sonota in almost every respect (except price).  \"Secondly if you dont understand how a manufacturer cant dominate a segment without leading in sales I dont know what to tell you. A nameplate alone cannot dominte- you have to look at total sales. In that measure Honda and Toyota lose. What does \"dominate\" mean to you? Apparently not what it means to the rest of us.\"GM should lose like Honda and Toyota losses. I don\\'t buy your line of reasoning either. If you want to say GM as a manufacturer sells more mid-size cars than other manufacturers that is certainly a true statement. But equally as true, is the best selling models are the Camry and Accord. In this way, respectively Toyota and Honda dominate the segment because they have the best selling individual models in the segment.  You guys are not going to change each others\\' minds no matter how many times you keep repeating yourselves.Say it once, explain it once if you have to, but then move ON.  I just rechecked the rental fleet sales for 2006.Fusion/Milan combined - 8,310Camry - 18,657Sonata - 41,867Altima - 14,087Nothing implied - just stating numbers for comparison.  One good thing Ford is doing is that it is limiting sales to fleets for the Fusion/Milan. Do you have numbers for Accord/Impala/Malibu/G6 etc.Nothing implied this end as well, just curious.  \"Name two comparos outside of C&D that the Accord has won. I do not recall the Accord ever being in a R&T comparo. Autoweek did a comparo between the Aura and \"benchmark\" camry earlier this year and picked the Aura. The Accord wasnt invited.

Your post makes no sense at all. No one buys at MSRP. If, as you advise, Toyota lowers the MSRP of the Camry to 10k, buyers will look to buy at 9k (hypothetical invoice). No mainstream car, especially one that sells updards of 400k per year, would sell at any MSRP.If you categorize the spread between MSRP and Invoice as a Toytoa discount, then I have nothing more to add to this part of the discussion - we will just have to agree to disagree  That is smart of Ford. They also eliminated the (old) Taurus from fleet sales. I wonder how many of new new Taurii they are selling to fleets? With other automakers limiting fleet sales (including Hyundai this year), I wonder where the rental companies are getting their cars? I do see more GM cars at Hertz lately (used to have mostly Fords and imports), and I\\'ve seen more Kias and Mazdas there of late.Historically Accord fleet sales have been very small.  \"care to back that up?

I am happy GM is really focusing on cars now; and the changes are there to see.

GM is making money and Ford did in the last quarter.2. The majority of G6s I see are not rentals. You can easily tell if they are rentals by looking at the wheels and the sticker on the back. Rental G6s are not GTs and have the thin spoked 17\" wheels or wheel covers. 3. A lot of Malibus are rentals although they have cut rental deliveries this year. That said, the car is in its last year and the rental dependence isnt surprising. In case you missed it Ford and GM have been cutting fleet sales for some time now so I\\'m not quite sure why you are arguing that they should do something that is already being done. I just saw an Accord rental car a few weeks back. We all know Camrys are being given to rental agencies in appreciable numbers. You also failed to mention that not all fleet sales damage profitability and resale value- only daily rentals. Corporate and government sales are OK since they dont involve piling on 30k miles in a year and then putting the car into the used car market at low prices.  \"first of all the camry is being sold to rental lots.

They have different names but GM doesnt care what they are called as long as they can sell them. As I said, if nameplates are all that matter than F150 is best vehicle in the country hands down. \"If features is all you care about, then you should wait for the Chinese cars - for sure they will have equal features at low, low prices. \"based on that comment I suspect you havent even been exposed to the Chrysler cars.

Personally I dont care much about rental cars- its just something that import leaning people use to disparage cars they dont like. And yet in Europe many of the cars we praise here in the US are used as police cars and taxis. If GM and Ford continue to shrink their rental presence guess who is going to pick up the slack?

In fact its sales are down in spite of the huge discounts available now. Its been the best seller under all conditions for the last 30 years or so. Sorry, but rebates dont explain it.Oh and since your into sales supremacy it should be noted the Explorer outsold the camry in the 90s. I guess that means it was the best family vehicle in the US market because the sales charts said so. And no most explorers were not being purchased by Hertz or contractors. \"Once again, you delibertely misinterpret.

As for the Chrysler cars- they are inferior in the ways I mentioned but overall they offer a lot not found on their competitors from the US and Asia. The MyGig system is a class exclusive and is not found on Accord or Camry. If you have any substantive, objective reasons for calling them bad cars please share it.  What part of reality don\\'t you understand -- all of it? They are selling more and more Impalas as fleet to keep production numbers up. The retail sales are those which indicate a popular car -- rather easy to understand, I would say. When testing mid-sized cars, the benchmark ( or STANDARD ) for the magazines has been either the Accord or Camry. It depends on how that magazine views a great car. Consumer Reports would most likely see a car as great for room inside, gas mileage, stopping distance, and ratings for reliability. Now some magazine like Road and Track may see a car as great for steering feel, the slalom testing, acceleration, and such, and use the Accord as the benchmark. They may also use the Mazda6 as a benchmark if handling is the focus of the testing. I do not recall them ever using a modern day Malibu as a benchmark or standard. Really now :blush: be honest, have you seen this done.It is possible that a \\'68 Malibu was however the standard in the industry.

Yes, the previous Malibu is, but that\\'s the only one we discussed.  \"The latest MT test was titled \\'Battle of the Benchmarks.\\' As for MT not inviting the Accord, I remember about sometime early last year there was a Camry/Altima/Accord comparo in MT which the Accord won. \"dont remember that one at all. got a link?\"Accord and Mazda6 won the RT comparo jointly, a couple of years back. \"R&T usually declares a clear winner based on its points system.

But my question is, who really cares.

Funny, isn\\'t it?  Oh heavens no! Why would a company kill off a great car by flooding the markets with fleet sales? They will let GM do that. I don\\'t think anyone ever said Accord and Camry win ever road test. If say a Mercedes sedan won a test against a Bimmer, that would make the Mercedes the new standard in the industry? Perhaps if many cars, or even the same car did that in test after test, then you have a clear picture of an industry standard. Always find it interesting when GM compares their V6 to another car with an i4. Not that it is any better. ( i did not say any worse ). If a person has $30K to spend, they are discounting the $34K CTS down to that level, and they may go lower. And I may add, the \\'07 looks better to me. So those willing to pay $30K for a loaded FWD, may have another option to buy a Caddy RWD for the same $$$$L  \"the V6 versions of the two cars are competitors.\"Really? bet GM didn\\'t know thatAre Accord and TSX competitors? what is your point?\"My point is that you can\\'t combine Malibu and Impala sales and neither does Chevy, forget GM.

Have you? I sat in the Sebring at the auto show and I dont like the design too much but the materials were no worse than current camry\"And that\\'s the truth as you see it? You need glasses. Chrysler interiors reek of hard, poor quality plastics, anyone with open eyes can see that. Even with Camry\\'s current interior, there is no comparison. Forget even mentioning the Accord.  If you buy a Sonata for $20k and a Camry for $24k and get $12K for the sonata in 4 years as opposed to $18k for camry the difference on paper is $2k that you \"lost\" by not buying Toyota. If the difference in payments was $30 a month the truth is you saved $1440 in monthly payments by getting Hyundai. That takes the difference down to $560. Now lets suppose you invested that $1440 instead of paying Toyota- whoops- there goes your \"savings\" in resale value at trade in. At worst you break even, at best you actually come out ahead with the Hyundai. You tell me which one is less expensive.  I will ask a simple question- have you or have you not sat in the Sebring or Avenger for any period of time? I have. The Sebrings interior is actually OK in terms of construction, its the design that is lacking. Have you ever seen the exterior of either car up close? I have and I\\'ve seen no evidence of poor construction. In fact, none of the reviews I\\'ve read knock either car for poor build quality. The complaints are softness (Sebring), lack of power and styling.

Now you tell me, have you sat in any Accord?  Actually one of Chrysler\\'s head honchos even admitted (on Autoline Detroit) that they took way too much money out of their interiors the last couple of years and that they were making drastic and quick changes to fix that asap. The Fusion interior looks like a Jaguar by comparison.  Thanks Akirby. 1487 - there you have the numbers. g6 is 39.3% fleet, camry 7.7%. Camry sold a total of 29,762 to fleets last year. The overall increase in Camry sales over 2005 is much higher, and Camry\\'s were selling to fleets in 2005 as well. So clearly the sales increase is not purely from rentals.  You bet; Ford has done well with the Fusion. I wish they could get the Euro Focus and Mondeo here.  no Malibu sold about 163k copies last year which is more than sonata and fusion as far as I know. And GM was cutting fleet sales as well. I\\'m sure 2005 numbers were higher than that. The car was not a failure as you stated. As I said, it was wholly competitive with the old camry. boxy styling, great fuel economy, nice interior space, good crash scores, etc.  \"not a Chrysler fan but I am a fan of the truth.\"I agree, if the truth be told, the Avenger for example, is not on the same standard as the Accord. But I\\'ll leave it to the reader to determine the relative value of Chrysler products.  \"no Malibu sold about 163k copies last year which is more than sonata and fusion as far as I know. And GM was cutting fleet sales as well.\"I seriously doubt the Malibu sold more than the Sonata last year. Pitted against the Fusion, it comes out worse, just sold about 20k copies more, while Fusion was not being sold much to rentals.  this should surprise no one that gets disappointed (we actually all do) with trade-in allowances or don\\'t necessarily equate lower prices with \\'value\\'.  \"When CD picks the Accord, you don\\'t trust it, but when it picks somehting you are arguing about, you use it as fact. Funny, isn\\'t it? \"C&D is very inconsistent in its decisions. Some make sense based on the facts and some dont. The facts clearly show the 2006 sonata had surpassed the camry in safety features, price and performance. The C&D comparo backed that up. They arent wrong all the time. When they rank a 2007 accord above the rest of the field in spite of medicore styling, features and performance scores I get a little skeptical. Based on the price and performance of the cars in their last test there was now logical reason for the Accord to win. Of course thats why they include \"gotta have it\" factor- they can always skew the results if the objective data doesnt support their preferred winner. If you know of ANY comparo where the old camry beat the 2006 sonata let me know.  \"My point is that you can\\'t combine Malibu and Impala sales and neither does Chevy, forget GM. \"And why cant you? Since both cover the same territory as camry they are both camry competitors. In the $20k-$30k range Chevy sells as many family sedans as Toyota. How about that? How does that fit into your argument that the Camry \"dominates\" the segment?  at least with the Honda you won\\'t have a dead battery when the car is brand new; it should last you 50 months. Golly, my crappy Ford battery was still working just fine after 8 years in Wisconsin. I proactively replaced it at that point.Oh yeah, and my last oil change at the Ford dealer was $3 including taxes and fees, with a coupon. :P  This is not a manufacturer discussion, this is a model discussion. Within the model discussion, sales numbers indicate Accord and Camry dominate. Why don\\'t you start another discussion in news and views to talk about GM vs Toyota and Honda. GM sells more cars than Honda, but there is no individual model (of which you lump everything into GM) that outsells the benchmarks, Accord and Camry.  been in accord and TSX. what does that have to do with NEW Sebring? I am not talking about the old model which had a terrible interior.  \"Within the model discussion, sales numbers indicate Accord and Camry dominate. Why don\\'t you start another discussion in news and views to talk about GM vs Toyota and Honda. GM sells more cars than Honda, but there is no individual model (of which you lump everything into GM) that outsells the benchmarks, Accord and Camry. \"you cannot dominate without a majority share of any class. its that simple. Accord and camry are best two selling nameplates- thats where it ends. They dont dominate anything and I wouldnt expect them to considering the level of competition in this segement. Do we need to look up the word dominate? As someone stated, the camry has a little over 10% of the midsize market. That isnt close to domination in my book. If sales equal benchmarks than Toyota nor Honda are the benchmarks when it comes to the midsize market since they are being beat by a competitor. Honda doesnt even outsell Chevy in midsize cars, much less GM as a whole.  I think you missed this:Malibu 58.8 % fleet salesImpala, which is the next size up from the Camry is similar in fleet sales, as in growing at an ever increasing percentage as fleet.You can combine the two, Malibu and Impala to try to come up with some sort of win over the Camry, but let\\'s do it with non-fleet sales all around and see what happens. Not that it really matters. Only matters with GM to keep the numbers looking good and keep the workers working on the lines. Can\\'t be too great a profit on fleet, but then again, it makes bucks so more power to them. It is however not a positive for the new car buyer. Used GM are usually pretty inexpensive cars, so I guess, as in the past, you buy domestic used, or deep discounted and Japan makes as new -- an old rule, which seems to still apply.The numbers game may be great fun, but it is time to get back to which cars are best, and why does one think they are the best. L  \"1487 - there you have the numbers. g6 is 39.3% fleet, camry 7.7%. Camry sold a total of 29,762 to fleets last year. The overall increase in Camry sales over 2005 is much higher, and Camry\\'s were selling to fleets in 2005 as well. So clearly the sales increase is not purely from rentals. \"that isnt current info. The 06 MY began in September 2005 which was two years ago. G6 sales are down this year, most likely due to lower fleet penetration. Camry sales increases are most likely due to aggressive discounting by Toyota and dealers. Just like they are doing with Tundra.  \"I think you missed this: Malibu 58.8 % fleet sales Impala, which is the next size up from the Camry is similar in fleet sales, as in growing at an ever increasing percentage as fleet. \"I think you missed that those numbers are from data nearly two years old. Not exactly current. As you and I both know GM has been reducing fleet sales in calendar year 2007 so I am sure MY07 charts would be different from the ones we are discussin here. Again, I dont really care about fleet sales that much. I have to discuss it because any discussion about domestic vehicles that sell well comes back to \"thats only because of fleet sales\". If anyone can tell me how fleet %\\'s prove that a car is crap let me know. Rental cars are usually base models that lack the best engines, features, suspensions and what not. Just like a base 328i isnt the same as an M3 a base rental car isnt the best of the line of a particular car. On the other hand I have heard some people say they drive stripped rentals and are surprised at how much they like the cars since they get their \"facts\" from forums like this that teach you every domestic car is a unrefined POS.  Here are the numbers for the first half of \\'07, since you claim that Accord doesn\\'t outsell Chevy in the midsize:Malibu = 64,227 cars sold and 58.8% as fleetAccord = 163.551 cars sold with 4.9% as fleetlarge car...Impala = 148,699 cars sold with 53.9% as fleetAre you combining the mid and large cars? Well, even if you did so, then took away the fleet sales, you have a double flop with the GM cars. Sorry, that be the fact.This does NOT mean one should eliminate an Impala off a shopping list, as it has its place, is a bit larger than others in its price range, it looks OK and gets decent gas mileage. To each his own, so try befor ya buy and see if it fits your style. Likewise the NEW or shall we say new to Malibu to come out, should be a very decent car to compare with the rest. New however would imply it is not related to the New First Ever G6, that other Epsilon. No, the New Malibu is an American Evolution of the Epsilon platform, this time taking form as a Chevy.Loren  \" seriously doubt the Malibu sold more than the Sonata last year.\"if you can find data to back that up let me know. The sonata sells 12k-14k units a month from What I\\'ve seen. I believe it was around 150k units last year.  No, I posted the Blog URL and it is for the first half of 2007. Where did you think all those wonderful sales of the old Impala came from? Overnight people got up in the morning and said, \" gee honey, I need a new Impala to get my excitement level in life up - take the kids, let\\'s go to Chevy, whoo-hoo! \" Get real ! L  Nope, talking about first half of 2007link   \"Here are the numbers for the first half of \\'07, since you claim that Accord doesn\\'t outsell Chevy in the midsize: \"I didnt know fleet sales dont count as sales. Thanks for clearing that up. Let me ask a question: whats the difference between Toyota chopping $4k off camrys to keep production up and GM selling Impalas to companies and govs to keep production up? The bottom line is that companies make moves to keep demand high and production lines moving. The \"natural\" demand for Impala and Camry would be far lower without rebates, fleet sales, etc. Is that info from calendar 2007? I assume you will give us the link.  \" I need a new Impala to get my excitement level in life up - take the kids, let\\'s go to Chevy, whoo-hoo! \" Get real !\"Yes! because the camry is the #1 selling car because its so SEXY! Get real! Please dont be silly enough to suggest the Impala is more \"boring\" than the top selling Asian cars.  The difference is you have the rental returns back as used cars, flooding the markets at super discounted prices, which trust me are lower than $4K off the hood. And the car becomes a bit less glamors when viewed as a taxi cab, company car, or rental beater unit. Sorry, it is not a good image maker. It also means you know that the car has no other way of being moved off the lot. Can we say a desperate move. As for pricing on Camry and Tundra, I personally believe they got out of line, as in pricing high, like GM does, then discounting. This is not good. Better to price closer to reality. For the buyer, even $4K discounts off on Camry is preferred to having it become a rental queen status. The new Sebring is doomed. Loren  \"you cannot dominate without a majority share of any class\"Sure you can. The Camry is the best selling individual mid-size model, and also happens to be one of the benchmarks. See how easy that was. Not comparing GM to Toyota. Comparing model against model.  How about some submissiveness.If the biggest selling model has a little over 10% of the midsize market then NO ONE is dominating this market. The camry is the biggest selling midsize model, this does not equal dominance, if 90% of buyers are choosing something else. But in any case, let that \"debate\" end.Now when one silly argument accounts for 90% of posts in the last couple of days...that\\'s dominance. About the only thing worth reading in the last couple days here was the list of \"benchmarks\".  Continue to buy Hondas and you will be fine. I dont base what cars I like on rental sales numbers. I mean its a good thing domestic cars do have this rental issue for you to talk about day in and day out because in terms of performance, quality and features the difference between these cars is minimal. But lets not talk about any of that- any car that is rented is crap- as long as its not a Nissan or Toyota product of course. BTW, what is the acceptable fleet %? I see that the 6, Sonata, Optima, Galant, etc. have pretty high fleet %\\'s. The Altima is better but still much higher than Accord and higher than Lucerne (different class of course). Is that acceptable? Is 20% the cut off between \"smart business\" and \"rental crap\"? Just let me know where we draw the line.  \"Sure you can. The Camry is the best selling individual mid-size model, and also happens to be one of the benchmarks. See how easy that was. Not comparing GM to Toyota. Comparing model against model\"I\\'m still trying to figure out who ever called the prior generation Camry the benchmark in anything but sales. Best sales dont equal benchmark as evidenced by comparing Silverado or Tundra sales to that of the F150. See how easy that was? The last gen camry was the eptiome of a mediocre car but it didnt matter because its the camry and its the default car choice for many people. The current car at least stands a chance of being considered a benchmark. According to my count it has won one comparo and lost three. Benchmark indeed.  \"I\\'m still trying to figure out who ever called the prior generation Camry the benchmark in anything but sales.\"I\\'m still trying to figure out who didn\\'t. Seems to me Toyota has figured out how to build a car the masses want. That by definition is a benchmark. The reputation of the manufacturer combined with the reputation of the car equals success.As you put it, I wish I had a business that has failed as miserably as the Camry. Benchmark indeed!  Point of clarification: the numbers I posted were Rental Fleet sales only, not total Fleet sales. As was already stated commercial fleet sales are good because they don\\'t flood the used car market with high mileage vehicles like rental fleets do. The numbers for GM (Impala, Malibu, G6) are only down by 1% -5% for the first half of 2007 (again only talking about rental fleet sales) so while they are reducing rental fleet sales it\\'s not by much.  and 53%+ of G6 sales to fleets is not a majoriry? must be the new math. actually surprised that number isn\\'t higher. GM as well as the members of the former Big 3 are so immersed in red ink over the last several years that they could accidentally have 20 or 30 more marginally profitable quarters and still not have to pay a dime of income tax as they all strive to close down more US plants putting more Americans out of work, open them in Canada, Mexico, the Orient etc etc. And no \\'sales\\' are \\'OK\\' when it involves losing $2500 on each and every car \\'sold\\' as GM was doing in 2005. And those mfgrs. with the strange sounding names? Talk to those folks that happen to live in Alabama, Ky., Tn., Tx., cALIF. ETC ETC. and ask them about the quality of their schools. Since only you seem to \\'know\\' that Camrys are being given away to rental agencies (7% NOT 53% of production) that fact????? of yours must obviously be reflected in the $10 Billion Toyota made during the same period GM lost that much. Give me (and us) a break!Congratuations on finally seeing an Accord rental, I saw a red sports car on a rental lot - had something of a prancing horse on it - what are the odds that you could find an Accord about the same time I saw an Enzo? Maybe it was the same rental agency - you think? and whatever gave you the idea that corporate/muncipal fleet cars don\\'t accumulate miles and don\\'t suffer in resale (generally it\\'s worse), you need to go to an auction or two, because new car dealers and higher end used car lots won\\'t touch \\'em - if you are not lucky (or foolish)enough to snare one of these beauties at auction you\\'ll likely find someplace where it says \\'your job is your credit\\', the down payment size is approximately what the guy paid for the silly thing, and boy would that guy just love to repossess it a few payments down the road!  First you say enough of this dominance discussion, then you go and write a post on it.If being a market leader day in and day out does not mean dominance over other manufacturers, I don\\'t know what dominance menas. Anyway, I am not going to comment on this anymore.  \"I\\'m still trying to figure out who ever called the prior generation Camry the benchmark in anything but sales. Best sales dont equal benchmark as evidenced by comparing Silverado or Tundra sales to that of the F150. See how easy that was?\"You don\\'t get it, do you? F150 analogy is irrelevant to Camry.  The Altima and Corolla saw some increases in fleet to move stock, as they neared the end of the previous design. Not sure about Corolla, but I am thinking a new \\'08 is out soon or they will introduce the \\'09 early on in 2008. The Corolla is aging and with it the higher fleet sales start coming in to view. I never said rental is crap. I assume that some is, and some is not. You tend to keep using words which demean your cars, I thought you liked. I do think it can ruin the image though, if all you see driving the G6 are those on vacation. Ponitac will likely ax the G6 altogether, or at the least change it to RWD from Australia. The New Malibu is the great hope of Epsilon. The Aura is a flop sales wise. All they need in the Saturn line was to import the Opels as Opels with as much Euro left in them as possible. The Aura XR, BTW is a sporty and shall we say fun little GM car, and worthy of comparison testing with the best of the best in its class. That said, the New Malibu with the 3.6 will be very much the same car. Just give us a couple good mid-sized. From SAAB all the way downward to G6, there are just too many Epsilons, with more on the way. How is the health of SAAB these days? Are the buyers new buyers, or are the old loyalist buying cars like the 9-3? Is the 9-3 a SAAB?L   I dont base what cars I like on rental sales numbersnow this ican actually understand and agree with - until the point that i want to trade it in and get hit squarely in my back pocket.  the \"puddle lights\" that are built into our 2007 AWD SEL Fusion\\'s outside rear-view mirrors (which also have heating elements in them). These handy lights illuminate downward, lighting the ground around the bottom of the door. They come on when the key fob is used to unlock the door. Nice feature.Like so many others, I am tired of reading about \"benchmarks\" and the never-ending debate about what the sales figures mean.Our Fusion also has a six-speed automatic transmission that is ultra smooth yet downshifts rapidly when you need extra \"go\" for merging or passing. It\\'s really sweet.  What you all think about the Cadillac CTS \\'07 if discounted say $5K off? I am thinking there is an opportunity for some people to get a Cadillac for below $30K. And the new \\'08 may be parked right next to it, so you can compare. To each his own, but I am still liking the original look. The car is a mid-size, as in slightly smaller than an Accord \\'07, so it can be included here as a car of discussion. I hear of monster priced FWD cars in this class, now topping the $30K, so why not consider the CTS. They look hot in red. The white and off white looks good too. OK, a lot of different colors, as it wears most of them well, though I am thinking the silver is not a bright enough silver.gotta run now... or walk that is, Loren  Now that sounds like a great idea for a blog! Those who wish to continue to expound on that subject can go to their CarSpace page and create a blog. Comments can be posted there. :shades:  Do you recall seeing camrys for rent 3 or 4 years ago? I dont. Yep. I specifically remember them in our area - most were Gold Camry LEs.  Oh thank you THANK YOU. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE can we get back to the meat of this discussion; the VEHICLES and not their sales numbers, etc.?  The purpose of this discussion really isn\\'t to debate benchmarks, fleet sales, manufacturers\\' moves and missteps, etc. The Auto News board and/or blogs are the best places for that sort of thing.We are supposed to be comparing the features and the attributes of the actual vehicles in this class. Karen has made a terrific suggestion and I hope those of you who are interested in these side topics will follow through.I have to tell ya - my mother used to say she\\'d argue with a gatepost if only the gatepost would talk back. I think some of you guys must feel the same! :sick: :P(get us back in the groove, grad - or anyone!)  Someone would offer to buy 400,000 Passats to illustrate to you that even though VW doesn\\'t have the capacity to make them right now, they would in an awful hurry if they had 400,000 guaranteed sales.The reason they don\\'t have the capacity is because they don\\'t have the demand for it!  Our Fusion also has a six-speed automatic transmission that is ultra smooth yet downshifts rapidly when you need extra \"go\" for merging or passing. It\\'s really sweet. I switched from manual to automatic when I got my mazda6 and have been pretty happy with the functioning of the auto. Mine is a 5 speed, because I have the 4 cyl...but it drops down 2 gears really quickly when you step on it, too.The other thing I like is it will go to redline before upshifting when you are flooring it. Does the 6 speed in the fusion do that, also? In the past I had read about automatics that limit the revs to around 5000...that was for the Contour. I assume that was a common practice. I am curious to know if it still is?  Please stop.  This is actually the Australian Toyota Aurion.I know a 350HP FWD sedan is pointless but I like it. Probably the best looking Camry ever. Toyota NA should offer this one and call it Camry SE TRD.  Someone posted earlier that some mid-sizers have a much lower residual percentage than others. While that is interesting data, it shouldn\\'t be taken by itself.Example:Car A (well-equipped V6 mid-sized sedan with alloys, moonroof, ESC, leather etc.): MSRP $28,000, purchase price $26,000, residual after 5 years 33% of MSRP, value after 5 years $9240, loss in value from purchase price $16,760.Car B (comparably-equipped V6 mid-sized sedan): MSRP $25,000, purchase price $21,000, residual after 5 years 23% of MSRP, value after 5 years $5750, loss in value from purchase price $15,250.It\\'s not just about percentages... it\\'s about $$$$ out of pocket. The car with the higher residual/resale percentage does not necessarily cost you less in real dollar depreciation.  So car A can only be bought for $2,000 off MSRP, but car B can be had for $4,000 off? Easy when you manipulate the figures to favor the less expensive car. And if car A is more disireable, wouldn\\'t it be worth a little more $$$ out of pocket? If I like car A more, I will be inclined to keep it longer, which will make the \"true cost to own\" lower.  And what if someone likes car B better, should they be frightened off based on differences in the percentage of depreciation?He is just pointing out that higher resale value does not automatically mean lower net cost. The example was designed to demonstrate this, why is that a problem? The point that is being made does not require that one car is discounted more than the other or that the residual value percentage is based on MSRP, rather than actual average selling price. A car that sells for $30,000 and loses 1/4 of that value will cost more than one that sells for $21,000 and loses 1/3.  BTW, I have seen the Malibu in the flesh at my local autoshow. If you are aware of any glaring issues with the new Malibu let us know since you are convinced that its totally new vehicle that could be a complete disaster.I didn\\'t say that and it couldn\\'t be farther from the truth, you are wildly exaggerating. I thought you were facts-based?Please note I dont bash imports, I just state facts that others seem to ignore.It looks like you weren\\'t sticking to facts. Please work on this.  That is one bad (as in good) looking Camry, even though I would never buy a Toyota.  2. The majority of G6s I see are not rentals. You can easily tell if they are rentals by looking at the wheels and the sticker on the back. Rental G6s are not GTsJust fyi, the rental G6 I had in North Carolina from Alamo during the summer WAS a GT. I wrote a fairly positive evaluation of the car.  And what if someone likes car B better, should they be frightened off based on differences in the percentage of depreciation? If someone thinks car B is better, they should buy car B. That\\'s simple enough, but why does car B have to be discounted twice as much as car A? Let\\'s be fair here, at least.  Question for the audience: Which manufacturer dominates the midsized sedan segment when fleet sales are removed for all? In other words, which manufacturer dominates in sales to the public? Is it GM, Toyota, or Honda? Oh for the love of Lotus PLEASE don\\'t answer that, audience. This forum is on its way to being shut down with this crap. The host has asked MULTIPLE times to stop this.  Look OK, and somewhat like the rest. I take it you have seen the New Malibu photos. Hard to get overly excited these days about any of the new stuff. Is the New Accord out in the showroom yet? I would say the Altima, when new was refreshing as sort of an inexpensive Passat, and the CTS was really something new. Don\\'t know if there is much in the way of new breathtaking stuff. The Milan and to a degree Fusion I kinda like in a way, even with the big butt. Other like the Aura, just fine, with a possibly more exciting version as the New Malibu with its sporty interior. All these seem to blur or is that blend into one. Anyway, the Camry, as shown with a new nose would work wonders. Plastic surgery is so successful these days in nose jobs. L  I think a few people need a timeout. You know who you are.  Question for tlong: Who cares?Haven\\'t we had enough of this benchmark and dominance crap?Maybe it has something to do with p.... envy syndrome!  Maybe it has something to do with p.... envy syndrome! For the little ears in this forum, he means \"parking\" envy; right m6?   For the little ears in this forum, he means \"parking\" envy; right m6? Oh, I thought he meant Power envy. I guess it depends on what you are doing while Parking (back seat). :surprise:  Just as an fyi, when you\\'re reading through 132 posts and answering some of them, you don\\'t get to reading about what we shouldn\\'t discuss until after you\\'ve made the postings. That may be why there is a lag in those posts shutting down, as many people haven\\'t seen the messages yet.I agree, no more dominance or benchmark postings :P On to the cars, while I haven\\'t yet seen the new Accord in person, I don\\'t tend to like cars any bigger than the old one. In fact, I\\'d say my Acura TL is a tiny bit bigger than I prefer. For the Honda buyer who wanted a slightly smaller Accord, the new Accord is too much and the Civic may be too little. Alas...  Do you think there are enough Hyundai dealerships around the USA? How about Kia? Wonder how it would work if both cars were available as Hyundai Kia dealerships, or would it just confuse people. Just think it would increase sales if you could find both of these cars at more dealerships. Mitsubishi, I hope has a plan. They are a rare find around these parts, both cars and dealerships. I see an occasional Galant, maybe an Evo or two, and a couple times a week say one of those new Eclipse is spotted running down the freeway. It ain\\'t looking pretty. If you could buy say a Galant for a thousand under what a similar Sonata discounted down to a rock bottom price line , would you consider it? L  Ya know, they did shorten the Corvette. Seems like they super size most cars these day. I too, would prefer a little trim off the length, and in some cases the width of those way too wide. I am slowing adjusting to my Accord \\'07 after having the smaller PT to whip around in. This means that parking is not always too perfect. :blush: See no reason to raise the roof, as in yet another inch higher on the Accord, nor another three inches in length. They are expanding the CTS too. What was wrong with the current size? L  you don\\'t get to reading about what we shouldn\\'t discuss until after you\\'ve made the postings. Except the players involved already KNOW they shouldn\\'t be discussing these things. This isn\\'t the first (or second, or third, or fourth, or....) time this has happened. And it\\'s always the same people. I\\'ve even been guilty a few times but enough is enough.  Well actually the discussion was relevant, but hopelessly deadlocked.Hey, what is Ford doing these days. Have not heard about anything Bold yet. How about the RWD cars to come, if any? Maybe it is all in the skunk works, with some interesting stuff to be sprung upon us in a year or two???  Loren  You can (if you insist) get them to switch out the Fram for a SuperTech. Certainly not up there with Purolator, but Champion is certainly a cut above Fram.  Yes, but in the case of Honda, I am a bit confused. I asked about the standard filter used at the Honda dealership, and he said it is one made by Fram to Honda spec. Perhaps this it true, or true baloney. You are so right though, on most cars I would just opt for the SuperTech filter. They seem to not stock too many filters though in the SuperTech. Thanks for refreshing the memory on the SuperTech name and the Champion as the manufacturer. Good info. Wonder what happens if you take a Porsche Boxster in there for, what is it, some 8 qts. or more of synthetic. Would they have the filter, or be able to find the filter. Heck, even the Miata has a hard to get to filter. Of course the engine is easy to find. Is it the Sonata which has some sort of new filter system where only a core is changed out? How does that work? - L  I looked at the fram filters, and they are not the same as the Honda filters (totally different material used).  Thanks - will check to see if I can read the label on the filter they used for the cars first oil change. Have you seen the new CTS? What ya think?goodnight from the left coast - L  Have you seen the new CTS? What ya think? No, I don\\'t go for \"luxury cars\". Too much $$ for things I don\\'t even want. My Accord has a few things I could easily do without.  Hey elroy, I\\'ll trade ya my heated mirrors and power-height seat for your dual climate control... whatdya say?   I could do without the power on my own seat, but thanks anyway. The dual climate control is one I do like.  You can take my dual climate control. I\\'ll trade it to you for passenger power seats.  I\\'ve never liked the CTS looks. To me it is too angular and vertical. But at least it is distinctive for those who do like it.  Hey, what is Ford doing these days.The Fusion and MKZ will be refreshed next year with exterior and (more importantly) interior tweaks (look at the Flex for a hint). Fusion gets a hybrid, the 3.5L engine, and a new 4 cylinder engine (2.5L I think). The MKZ should get the new 3.7L V6 and a new interior similar to the MKS (I\\'m guessing on that last one). The next generation Fusion/Milan/MKZ will now share the same platform as the European Mondeo. Ditto for the NA and Euro Focus. The new B car will be out in a couple of years and looks like it will be worth the wait.The new RWD North American platform will be a joint design with the Aussies called the Huntsman. Should replace all the current RWD cars and allow new products to be built like the Interceptor and MKR. Unfortunately it\\'s in the early stages and won\\'t be ready for at least 3 years.  and whatever gave you the idea that corporate/muncipal fleet cars don\\'t accumulate miles and don\\'t suffer in resale (generally it\\'s worse), you need to go to an auction or two, because new car dealers and higher end used car lots won\\'t touch \\'em - if you are not lucky (or foolish)enough to snare one of these beauties at auction you\\'ll likely find someplace where it says \\'your job is your credit\\', the down payment size is approximately what the guy paid for the silly thing, and boy would that guy just love to repossess it a few payments down the road!So wait, you mean to tell me that rental cars, which have only been driven very gently by the nicest of individuals (of course with the upmost concern for Mr. Hertz or Mr. Avis\\' investment in the vehicle they are piloting), or municipal vehicles (which are actually titled differently) that were merely driven by a city\\'s caring and distinguished employees, are worth less in the resale market than a low mileage, one owner cream-puff? You don\\'t say.  I know a 350HP FWD sedan is pointless but I like it. Probably the best looking Camry ever. Toyota NA should offer this one and call it Camry SE TRD.Why would they name a car a TuRD?  Why would they name a car a TuRD? That notion popped into my head also.  Our MSRP $27,105 2007 AWD SEL Ford Fusion has some of the cheapest carpeting I have ever seen in a car, any car. Even the rug in our 2000 Ford Focus is of better quality.I guess its the bean counters at their finest but I would gladly trade the automatic dimming inside rear-view mirror for a better grade of carpeting. This stuff is really flimsy, Wal-Mart grade.  Boz - supposedly a lot of those things are being fixed with the 09 model out next year. Whether that includes the carpeting or not I\\'m not sure. Guess we\\'ll have to wait and see.  Boz - supposedly a lot of those things are being fixed with the 09 model out next year. Whether that includes the carpeting or not I\\'m not sure. Guess we\\'ll have to wait and see.Allen, I believe FoMoCo really has a winner with the Fusion/Milan/MKZ trio. They are not perfect, of course, but very competitive in their respective market segments.I didn\\'t notice the quality of the carpeting until I vacuumed. Hopefully Ford will continue to improve these models into the future.I also hope the government makes it mandatory that turn signal blinkers be incorporated into all outside rear-view mirrors. The Fusions don\\'t have that but it is a very nice safety feature I believe.  I think its a trend to reduce weight and cost. My \\'93 Accord interior is much more plush feeling than my \\'07.  My \\'93 Accord interior is much more plush feeling than my \\'07.So, you\\'re a two Accord family? Neat. Can you detect a lot of improvement in 14 years? How many miles on the \\'93? Was your experience with the 1993 what made you decide on the 2007? Just curious.Our overall satisfaction with a 1997 Thunderbird and with a 2000 Ford Focus was a factor in our decision to buy a 2007 Fusion.  Because any well educated person will ask what TRD is before calling it Turd... :sick:  It never ceases to amaze me how many things are going to be fixed \"next model year\", but never really seem to be accomplished. Think about it, interiors, mechanical, etc all seem to be lined up to be fixed \"later\". Is it impossible to fix things NOW for a change? I think of the example of fuel mileages. We have been promised better mileages now since the 1970\\'s, but I don\\'t see any significant changes. I remember several V-8\\'s with true hwy averages in the upper 20\\'s. Yes some vehicles are better, but most are not much different. Oh well, my .02 cents. van  So, you\\'re a two Accord family? Neat. Can you detect a lot of improvement in 14 years? How many miles on the \\'93? Was your experience with the 1993 what made you decide on the 2007? Just curious.I am not a good person to ask. The \\'93 was just sold with 145k, the vehicle was not \"maintenance free\" over the course of its life, but it was acceptable. Honda was at the top of their game in the early 90s with fun sporty cars. I always liked the way the car drove, I thought the handling was very good. The 5 speed transmission was one of the best in the business (if the throws were a little long) and the car had an upscale feel (the fabrics and carpets felt very high quality). Even the sound system (an Alpine designed unit, I believe) was good for \\'93. I got about 30 mpg with it on my 20-30 minute commute, which is almost all highway with very little traffic - and I typically accelerate slowly although I cruise quickly).I really don\\'t think you can compare the \\'93 to the \\'07, the \\'93 was a compact/midsized vehicle designed to be sporty and fun to drive, while still being economical. The \\'07 is designed to isolate the driver from the fact that they are driving. I guess its bigger, if that is how one measures improvement. It has 20 more horsepower, but its also several hundred pounds heavier. It has bigger wheels, but they use some obscure tire size so its much harder to find actual performance tires than it was for the old Accord. It does a great job holding an infant seat, but so did the old Accord (both in comparison to our Subaru Legacy, which does a lousy job, IMHO). Oh, it has an RKE that can also roll down the windows, like on VWs a few years ago, the old Accord didn\\'t have a clicker thing. The sound system has a 6 CD changer but no input for an iPod (something the \\'93 offered via tape adapter). My experience with the \\'93 was not so positive as to influence future Honda purchases, but not so negative as to preclude them either.My biggest purchase factors were price and availability of a manual transmission. To that end, I think I did okay but not great. I am going back and forth with the idea of leaving it totally stock and selling it in 2-3 years, or modifying it into something I would enjoy more knowing I will be stuck with it forever.Actually, at this point, because the Legacy wagon does such a poor job with an infant seat, I might be swapping cars, and since the Legacy has a much sportier ride and driving feel, I might be okay with that.  Because any well educated person will ask what TRD is before calling it Turd... Nah, I am reasonably well educated and I even know what it stand for and still call it that. Its on all the Toyota trucks in CA. Its the same reason you don\\'t see FaRT for Ford Racing Team.  Well, I guess it\\'ll take a well educated person to not call TRD a turd. Not even a \"reasonably\" well educated person can manage to do that...Sad. :sick:  and choose the Chrysler mid-size vehicles for their next car?  We have been promised better mileages now since the 1970\\'s, but I don\\'t see any significant changesRight. And there hasn\\'t been any change in power or emissions requirements, either.The 1977 Trans-Am had a 6.6L V8 and only made 200 hp. My 3.0L Fusion makes 221 and it puts out far less emissions.  In a way, it is sort of like the Old Jetta. Now they rounded off the Jetta and lost the style. I would agree, for most cars, it would be just \"too\" everything. For some reason, both the Jetta and CTS, after initial shock at first sight, became something I liked. I would normally be pulled towards only the smooth, lower and more rounded like say the wonderful Jag sedan.In its class the Fusion / Milan look pretty good. Most likely not the styling which has held it back from being a leader. Would be an interesting survey to do - which car, in mid-size, and under $25K looks the best to you? Just for a moment forget the all the other attributes, and only consider the looks. And in a larger sized car? L  Well I just got an Accord with 244HP and my old \\'65 Mustang I had when a kid was 200HP, so there is another pair to compare. Gosh I think in the \\'76 Olds Starfire wasn\\'t something like 110 or 120HP for V6 back then. A very rough V6, but it always chugged along. For bang for the buck, there is nothing like the new cars. Now if gas wasn\\'t $3.25 per gallon, we would be in drivin\\' heaven. Now we should by now be seeing better fuel economy though on some cars. Due to weight of safety equipment and structure, without the expensive aluminum, it appears we are getting fatter. More plastics and aluminum eventually will come into play, I would guess, along with it higher prices.At 29 MPG freeway mileage, I am happy with my fuel economy when power is compared to the past, per amount of gas consumed.And a Honda is pretty clean burning. Actually, Ford, GM and a World of better cars for emission control is now available. So yes there is some progress. L  Sounds good for Ford !  ... but why does car B have to be discounted twice as much as car A? Let\\'s be fair here, at least. I gave a realistic example. Let me make it more concrete for you so that you can see it\\'s a fair example:Car A = Accord EX-L V6 or Camry XLE V6 (with VSC option). MSRP on each is about $28k. There are no rebates on these cars. $2000 off is a pretty good discount at this time. Maybe some will get a better discount, but some will not.Car B = Sonata Limited V6. MSRP is about $25k. Typical rebates on the Sonata for the past two years have been $2000-3000, once the model-year changeover is done. Assume $2500 in rebates and near-invoice pricing for a total discount of $4000. This is a realistic discount based on reports from the Sonata Prices Paid discussion. Again, some will get better deals and some won\\'t.If you don\\'t think it\\'s fair that not all automakers offer the same level of rebates and discounts on their mid-sized cars, don\\'t complain to me about it. :surprise:  I fear my next vehicle will be a minivan, and likely a Chrysler/Dodge one. Either that or convincing my wife we just need a Mazda5...although the manual trans will be a selling point for her.  I think it\\'s fair, and I also believe one gets what they paid for.  As long as you realize that a lot of what you are paying extra for on an Accord or Camry is brand image--which doesn\\'t really help you unless you care about having other people see you driving a Honda or Toyota vs. something else.  Well, as long as you also realize that \"paying extra for an Accord or Camry is brand image\" in purely YOUR OPINION then I think we can move forward and talk about these cars in an objective basis.Maybe you can\\'t see why Accord and Camry cost higher than its competitors but that doesn\\'t mean that\\'s the case in other people\\'s eyes.Just so that you\\'ll know, there are people out there drive a Honda or Toyota not because they care about how other people see them. It\\'s because of they have good experience with the brand and they see something special in Accord and Camry\\'s offering.  Would be an interesting survey to do - which car, in mid-size, and under $25K looks the best to you?I can honestly say I believe the 2007-08 Fusion is the best-looking mid-size car available today. It is distinctive in a very pleasing way. It stands out from the plain-Jane Asian lookalikes.  Selling say 27% as fleet and deep discounting the car, my guess is that Hyundai has yet to shake off the sins of the past. Time may heal everything, but unlike Honda, or say Subaru, the images of the early Hyundai cars is still in the minds of (many) buyers. Thus we have the warranty and deep discounting. Problem with the discounting is that it becomes a constant reminder of a car which is not making it in the market place, like the top contenders. It becomes a constant reminder, and tarnishes image. People, to a degree, may also be buying image as a part of the car. Think of a Jetta, when it was quite the thing. In my college town, there those Jettas due to the coolness factor and telling Daddy she needed a safe car, factors were just about the number one car around the campus. Bet it is a harder sell to get the kid to drive a Hyundai. Of course in my day, we bought our own car, and it would usually be used, or sometimes really used, depending on how much we could save.Then you have the dealership network -- is it strong for Hyundai?Loren  A brand image follows years of engineer quality and a successful car. Pretty simple. I ended up with a Honda this time, as they offered a very good trade-in on my PT, plus a discount on the Accord which brought it easily into the same price range as say the Fusion/Milan, and a bit less price wise than the Aura XR, which had $1,500 off at the time. I still do not see why people believe that Japan makes do not make offers which are good. They may not deep discount or give away a car, but this is a good thing. If brand image fails to meet reality, any brand will drop off the map. So far the Big Two have not dropped off the map.Does this all mean that there are but two cars to choose from which make sense? OF COURSE NOT. All people are trying to get accross here on the board (well most are, with some fanatics) is that it is more than just image, though they have a good image which doesn\\'t hurt sales, and that the total price in and out is going to be about the same or better in some cases. Not every case - it is possible that an Accord or Camry could in some scenario cost a couple thousand more, as well as, costing someone else a couple thousand less to own. Life has variables. Main thing is liking or loving what you own, and it not becoming a pain. There is no right or wrong here, but rather some interesting options. If they ever bring back inexpensive RWD mid-sized to smaller cars, we shall have even greater options. L  Very true. I had a 93 Buick LeSabre LTD that I just had hauled away by Kars for Kids. On trips to Michigan from Chicago area I would consistenly get 29 and sometimes 30mpg straight highway. Over the years I would say my driving averaged about 50/50 city/hwy and I almost always averaged 24-25 mpg. That was a heavy, nice riding, quasi-luxury car. Now I see dinky 4cyl cars that have a hard time averging that. What gives?  The Lesabre had incredibly tall gearing - great for highway.  You\\'re right. I could tool along at 70 at about 2000 rpms. I can\\'t remember the term but I had some kind of \"sport package\" that reduced the gearing some for more jump off the line but it still may have had the same 4th gear as other LeSabres. Anyway, I noticed my 4cyl Mazda6 runs at about 25,500rpms at 70. I think I\\'m going to end up getting very similar performance gas mileage wise. But I do love the way the 6 handles.  You might want to check the calibration on your tach!  Brand image, aka brand reputation, aka supreme and legendary reliability with Honda & Toyota. So you pay more for the quality, which, in order to assume is \\'just\\' image, you\\'d have to assume that Honda and Toyota deliberately decided to lower their standards ALL OF A SUDDEN and build lower quality vehicles like everyone else. (with few exceptions).  \\'93 LeSabre weighed maybe 250 pounds more than a 4 cyl Mazda6. So there is not all that much of a difference in weight. Based on fueleconomy.gov, you should expect 2-4 mpg better from the 6.If you had a V6 in the Mazda6 that\\'d probably get about the same mpg as the old Buick. Note that the 3.8L Buick engine was only 170 HP, high torque though. The 4 cyl mazda engine is rated at 156 HP.  As long as you realize that a lot of what you are paying extra for on an Accord or Camry is brand image--which doesn\\'t really help you unless you care about having other people see you driving a Honda or Toyota vs. something else. People don\\'t buy Honda\\'s or Toyota\\'s for brand image, that is what Acura and Lexus are for!!!People buy Honda\\'s and Toyota\\'s because they cost more to build and produce, but they also deliver superior longevity, performance, economy, durability, reliability, and dependability. Those more expensive parts also provide great interior feel, fit, finish, luxury, and quality. You really do get what you pay for.... if it is from a REPUTable company.  Andres3 - evidently you\\'ve never worked in management for a manufacturing company, and helped determine the warranty period issued on a product - I have. And quality, build quality, whatever you wish to call it, has a lot to do with the offered full or limited warranty period. As an example, do you think Hyundai could continue to offer a 10 year/100K warranty if its warranty repair costs were high at the dealer level - of course not. Nor can any company regardless of product. Manufacturers who offer long limited warranty periods do so because they believe in their product, quality and otherwise. Long warranties are not just a marketing ploy, contrary to your belief. A company has to believe in the quality of its product offered with a long-term warranty, otherwise in short order the warranty expenses will literally kill the company.   I am not talking about the old model which had a terrible interior. Don\\'t forget that the Old Sebring also had nothing but fully black dots and terrible rankings for reliability from both CR and JD.  Then do please explain to me why Hyundai doesn\\'t offer the same warranty to 2nd owners as it does to 1st owners?Then do please explain to me why GM\\'s warranty only goes for a measly 5 years, but it also goes for 100K miles. Then do please explain to me why Chrysler upped their warranties to lifetime MID YEAR through the same production cycle? Did GM really double their quality (and warranty length) because their quality doubled from 2006 to 2007 (from 50K to 100K miles)?Did Mazda\\'s quality drop by 25% because their warranties fell from 4 years and 50K to 3 years and 36K from 2006 to 2007?Did Toyota and Honda\\'s powertrains improve by 66% since their warranties went from 3 years to 5 years recently?  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118972842681227168.html?mod=hps_us_at_glance_mmI particularly liked this part:\"GM, for its part, has been trying to use the well-received Aura to steal customers from its main foreign rivals. This summer, in a bid to shake up the market, GM put a Camry and an Accord in each of its Saturn dealerships around the country and encouraged car buyers to test-drive the vehicles side-by-side.The move had little impact on Aura sales, and GM has now ended the effort. It has also scrapped a plan to have Chevy dealers keep Camrys and Accords on hand to compare against the new Malibu sedan that arrives later this year.At the Frankfurt auto show, GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz said his company\\'s own focus groups also find consumers instinctively rate GM vehicles below Toyota\\'s or Honda\\'s. But he said GM\\'s scores are getting closer.Chrysler is also looking for a little more consideration. A few weeks ago, the company began offering a lifetime warranty on its vehicles\\' engines and transmissions, an industry first. So far it\\'s unclear if it is helping sales, but it may be another tactic that import buyers just ignore.\"Looks like I\\'m not the only one who finds Chrysler \"objectionable,\" when people find it easy to ignore their fine print riddled lifetime warranty.Also, looks like too many people preferred the Accord and Camry to the Aura and Malibu, so you won\\'t be seeing Honda\\'s and Toyota\\'s at Saturn or Chevy dealers anytime soon, or in the near and distant future. I KNEW that idea of direct comparison would backfire. I\\'d of bet 100 to 1 odds on it.  So the Saturn Aura back-to-back-to-back is over?Did the Aura do better because of it?  Oh dear! At least they bought a Honda and a Camry, so the resale value was high when they had to sell the two  If the comparison did not bump sales using the i4 engine cars, what on earth would have happened should they have tried to compare one on one, as in V6.Now I did do just that. Honestly, the XR compares well to the Japan cars, as in this car is a much improved effort compared to those of yesteryear.The XE Aura is OK if you need to save a few thousand, are buying it as a family car, or like that old four speed tranny and OHV engine combo, which a few people prefer, then it too is not a bad deal. That said, with a wider Camry and Accord on the deck there to show customers, they may sit inside and think, wow, this is more room for the family. Oh well, another mistep by management. L  Yeap, and the in town mileage is poor. Overall, the old 3.8 V6 did OK with the too tall gear. I recall back in the later 80\\'s going up to Tahoe from Carson City, it is steep and the poor thing tried to get up to speed, then fell back to third, but that was over revving, so it would go back to fourth and do the cycle again, each time losing ground for speed. No way to drop it down, as who knows the RPM\\'s and it sounded like it was gonna blow-up when pushed to high on revs, so I let cycle between the too taller gears, which made more noise than power. I had the 150HP and later cars did get the 200HP, which is of course better.Overall, the gas mileage is going to be better with a i4 engine, though it differs by make. - L  Chrysler has a better powertrain warranty than Camry or Ccord so I\\'m not sure how you figure that you sacrifice quality by getting one of their products.One way would be, driving them. Another way would be looking at the quality they speak of...I don\\'t care if they provide lifetime warranty multiplied by two on that thing, and it actually lasts, I just choose to not having to live with it. And you guessed it right, those pictures are from a 2007 Dodge.  The guy was trying to say that Crystal is as good as Diamond, or Cubic Zirconia or any equivalent of that.What he is saying is the equivalent of that for sure when comparing Chrysler quality to Honda or Toyota.  According to GM in the article, yes, the Aura back to back to back comparison is OVER, done with, and terminated. The Aura sales did not increase one iota because of the comparisons at dealer lots.  I don\\'t see anything wrong in those photos of the Dodge interior. Am I missing something?  I don\\'t see anything wrong in those photos of the Dodge interior. Am I missing something? A Chrysler product is perfect for you.You are the perfect case that paying the premium of an Accord or Camry is like wasting money...Nothing wrong with that, it\\'s just some people have higher standard about interior quality and fit-n-finish than others. To each of his own.  it\\'s just some people have higher standard about interior quality and fit-n-finish than others.And I suppose all of the people you describe own/drive Accords and Camrys? Gimme a break. Next you\\'ll tell me the Hondas and Toyotas don\\'t use plastic in their interiors.  Please don\\'t take it to heart - all Honda owners aren\\'t so snappy...That being said, I can see this forum getting shut down. I can hear the forum itself talking now...\"Where am I going and what am I doing in this handbasket?That\\'s all I\\'ve got to say about tha-at. - Forrest Gump  And I suppose all of the people you describe own/drive Accords and Camrys?Did I say that? Please don\\'t finish my sentence if you can\\'t read my mind.Granted that there are people who buy Accord and Camry based on brand image. But there are also people who buy it based on objective reasons like me and many others here.Of course Honda and Toyota use plastic in their interiors, even MB, BMW and Lexus do. However, there are different quality of plastic. If you can\\'t tell the difference then like I said, go for the less expensive one.  Nobody said anything of the sort.To all: Knock off the personal comments. Some posts have been removed and I\\'m sorry if I missed any that should have been.Somehow I think I\\'ve said this a couple or twenty times before, but if there is something going on here that you think needs my attention please EMAIL ME instead of posting. That will get me here as soon as I\\'m online. Otherwise I won\\'t see it until I just run into it on my usual rounds like I did here.Posting to me to take care of something is a waste of your time and mine. By the time I see that post I\\'ve also already found the problem.  Okay - let\\'s move on.  If you can\\'t tell the difference then like I said, go for the less expensive one.I still say I see nothing wrong with the photo of the 2007 Dodge. If that means I\\'m not a good judge of plastic, then so be it.  If you sat in an Accord every day you would see the difference easily. That is some very cheap/hard plastic. If you never see high quality plastics you have nothing to compare it to. To some people the quality of the plastic doesn\\'t mean much, as long as it holds together. Depends on what you\\'re used to I guess.  Back in post #5340, in response to comments about the Fusion\\'s trans, I had posted:I switched from manual to automatic when I got my mazda6 and have been pretty happy with the functioning of the auto. Mine is a 5 speed, because I have the 4 cyl...but it drops down 2 gears really quickly when you step on it, too. The other thing I like is it will go to redline before upshifting when you are flooring it. Does the 6 speed in the fusion do that, also? In the past I had read about automatics that limit the revs to around 5000...that was for the Contour. I assume that was a common practice. I am curious to know if it still is? I had hoped I might get some comments about other transmissions in response...  I guess I was being spoiled by the cars I drive and used to drive:1990 Acura Legend1992 Honda Accord1997 Honda Accord2006 Lexus IS350No wonder I can\\'t stand crappy interiors...The 1994-1997 Honda Accord has better interior quality wise than the 1998-2002 version IMO. Honda did improved the 2003- version by quiet a lot though.  I suppose we need similar pictures of other vehicles from close-up just like the one\\'s of the Dodge to show even you... the differences. But I assure you, the differences between the plastic in that Dodge and higher end cars is at least equivalent to the difference between Toyota\\'s reputation and Chrysler\\'s.Then again, there was a girl I once knew who thought the previous generation Altima interior was \"great.\"  If you sat in an Accord every day you would see the difference easily.I\\'ll just have to take your word for it for the time being. I sit in a 2007 AWD SEL Ford Fusion every day and the quality of the plastic seems just fine to me and everything fits exactly as it is supposed to.  Dude... if your transmission is only going to 5,000 RPM when you floor it, then something is either wrong with your transmission or engine. You might be driving a truck engine... that would be one explanation. Or you might be driving in an ancient domestic 3 speed auto that they seemed to use all the way up to the year 2000 and on. I\\'ve gotten a 1992 Honda Civic DX Hatchback with 4 speed-Auto closer to 7K than 5K RPM, and that was when it was close to 200,000 miles. My 2003 Honda Accord LX v6 coupe would happily reach the redline or at least within 500 rpm\\'s of it each time I floored it. Heck, even my Neon would usually come within 1K of the redline.the audi likes to go 200-400 into the redline before shifting.... so what if it shifts even in manual mode... no reason to go more into the redline then that.... especially since the engine runs out of breath up there.... whereas Honda\\'s just keep on breathing fire into the redline.  Regarding wanting other input about autos shifting before redline... here\\'s my input:I recently had to rush to the hospital for my hospitalized grandfather (he\\'s home and recovering now). I was in my 1996 Accord at the time. It has a 4-speed Auto, with 130 hp. I was really booking it trying to get there, faster than I ever go. Luckily it was nearly midnight, and with my flashers on, people were moving out of my way. That being said, redline is 6,300RPM. In first and second gears, the car runs to about 6,000-6,100 RPM before shifting (at about 37 MPH, and 77 MPH). In third gear however, the car shifts at about 5,500 RPM into 4th/Overdrive, a little under 100 MPH.I hope that helps.On a sidenote, the car was still quite smooth (although loud) running those kind of RPMs and speeds. It ran 100 -105 MPH like a champ for a few miles of empty interstate. Not bad for 174k miles and 11.5 years for only 130 hp!Also, my 2006 Accord 4-cyl Auto (redline: 6,500RPM) shifts about 6,200 RPM in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, Accord I have. If my Accords shifted at 5,000 RPM, they\\'d never reach their horsepower peak (which is 5,250 RPM I think). I\\'d be WAY unhappy with that.  Multi-valve 4 cylinder and small V6 (like the 2.5 duratec) motors need to be pumping at a certain rate or better to take advantage of the improved breathing ability of the motor. VTEC compounds that effect.My 2.0l 8v Mitsubishi motor felt faster off the line than the 2.2 in the Accord from the same era. Once we got to the skinny end of the tach, things reversed. Likewise, the 3.8l old world GM motor (and the BMW eta motor) is great from 0-30, but runs out of steam as the revs climb. I have driven a late 80s Bonneville around some hilly areas (Cincy) and never felt like it was lacking power, even with a full load of passengers.I have never had an automatic myself, so I have never had to worry about when the car was shifting.  Like Grad said with his cars, my 2 cars and 1 truck have all shifted about 200rpm before redline (92 and 03 Accords and 97 T100 Truck). None of my other cars had tachometers, so I couldn\\'t tell you when they shifted.  honda part # 15400-PLM-A02= FRAM honda part # 15400-PLM-A01= FiltechI don\\'t know much about Hondas but Fram did get part of the Honda contract. Fram filters are universally dissed, but only the \"orange can-o-death\" is actually bad. Actually there are many people happily using orange Frams, much of the bad rep. comes from a Mopar web page put up by a guy named Russ Knize. Everyone who ripped up and compared Frams piled on. Actually the namesake of Bobistheoilguy has done filter flow tests and the Frams, because there\\'s so little inside do quite well in that department. I don\\'t know much about Honda filters but would be willing to bet that the Filtechs are much better constructed but that the Fram built units are closer to the upmarket silver Frams than the base orange units. Probably at least the equal of the ST Champions. Of course I\\'m sure they cost a great deal more.  They do not use plastic toy quality plastics in their cars, is what people are trying to get across. Note the dash is more rubber like and softer on say the Accord for \\'07. Chrysler / Dodge interiors are cheaper. That said, the over all car value, as in getting RWD at a reasonable price, is still there. Not a bad value in that respect. I think the 3.5V6 300 is something like $28K and the Charger is $24K to $26K as starters with the better engine. I test drove a couple. Seems like slightly lighter feel to steering than I prefer, yet the car seems in control. Acceleration was in the getting it done class. If you like the tall doors and a bit of a challenge to see out of windows, the car offers a good size, RWD, a different look, and the seating is OK. I certainly would not say it is junk; it is just something different. The new Sebring I have nothing good to say about however, so I will leave it at that.Loren  The Aura sales did not increase one iota because of the comparisons at dealer lots. Do you know this for sure? I doubt it.Quote:Saturn\\'s efforts helped boost Aura sales figures this summer. CNN reports that \"Aura sales increased 24% from June, when the program started, through July. At the same time, the overall market for midsized cars went down 14%. July was the second-best month for the Aura since the car\\'s launch in 2006.\"article  Mann of Germany manufacturers some of the best oil filters made, along with Purolator (specifically, the PureOne filter) here in the USA. Interestingly, a number of Asian manufacturers use Mann as their OEM source, but it\\'s not the Japanese.  I thought Honda oil filters were identical to Hyundais. If so, $15 for a Fram, any Fram is a bit much. My assumption is what you\\'re saying is that the Fram built Honda filters run $15 and the Filtech run $20, right. What do Wally-World orange Frams run about $3? ST\\'s about $2.50. Fifteen bucks would get you a couple of real nice Purolators. I have a Kia with the 4 cylinder Hyun/Kia/Mitsu/Chrysler world engine. Didn\\'t replace the original filters but from experience the Hyundai filters are very well built. Remember some comment on bobistheoilguy by someone who used them on his Honda. That ought to give Honda dealers fits. On an earlier post there were some comments about the drop in filter cartridge on Hyundais. That\\'s the new v-6, I think. I have no problems with Fram branded air filters. Just the orange oil filters-- cheesy, and the upmarket Fram oil filters-- too expensive.  I compared air filters, not oil filters. The fram air filter is not the same as a Honda air filter. I haven\\'t looked at the oil filters side by side, but would be a lot harder to determine since you can\\'t see inside. I use only Honda parts, and they seem to work just fine for me. The price difference between the fram and Honda air filters was $5.00 ($15 vs $20) sorry for the confusion with oil filters. :surprise:  Sorry for the ignorance..but how would I do that?  If you back some posts, it was from an article which was quoting GM as saying it was not effective. I do believe they increased the discounts a bit. The advertising increased, which helps. A 24% increase is a good thing. Of course the numbers are still too low. A 23.7% fleet sales for the first half of 2007 may be some indicator. Maybe they kicked in some extra fleet sales, or something. 20,888 for the first half of the year, as retail sales, divided by six is around 3,481 per month. If you increased that number by 24% you have 835.5 more cars sold that month for retail. Hey, anything going up is a good thing. I simply do not understand the marketing however. Now they will have Saturn Auras, and New Malibus with the same engines and drive-trains. Now add in the original, the G6 and they compete with even more for a piece of the pie. I did not test drive that other Epsilon, the other of the four, or will that soon be five brothers, the SAAB 9-3. They say those drive nice.And there may be yet another one as a Cadillac the BLS, or it may be scrapped for USA. Oh yeah, the sixth would be the Fiat.... oh I\\'ll pass on that one :P I am thinking, for the photos of the interior, the coolest of the lot is gonna be the New Malibu. Not to say if someone gave me an Aura XR or a SAAB I would not be more than happy to drive it. :shades: Loren  I don\\'t see anything wrong in those photos of the Dodge interior. Am I missing something?Yes you did. Or perhaps you might if I compared hard plastic in one (Honda) to the hard plastic in the other (Dodge). Excuse the coloration, I took the Honda\\'s picture under fluorescent lamp and didn\\'t change my camera\\'s settings (manual mode).HondaDodgeDo you see any difference? To me their similarities end with the fact that they are both hard plastics (the dark shade in the Honda pic is hard plastic, the lighter shade is padded vinyl so don\\'t worry about that). The point is: Not all hard plastics are created equal. And there is a quality gap that can be so obvious yet, I\\'m surprised, so obscure/non-existent to many (please don\\'t take it personally).  Here is another example of poor quality (relatively speaking, of course). And I\\'ve the eyes for it, and can\\'t stand these kind of stuff in my car.The gap below the seek button shows you two steel plates. It spells cheap to me. Sure it should work fine and most may not notice it, but too bad, things like this are good reasons for me to dismiss many vehicles.  Usually, it is first gear (or, occasionally, first two gears) with AT that revs are limited. The rest of the gears may allow you to hit redline. So it is still true. In my 1998 Accord, it will shift out of first at 5800 rpm (redline is 6300 rpm) but will go to redline in second gear (about 75 mph).Some manumatics will allow you to hold first gears thru redline too (Acura TSX\\'s does that).  Well it is robbing some interior qualities to give you say the RWD and a unique styling. Chrysler, like every other car, is the sum of its parts, and thus if ya like the sum, buy it. There are some things people value more than other items. Interiors is not a strong point for Chrysler\\'s at all. As I recall, I always thought the old cars had GM first with Body by Fisher, then perhaps the Ford line, and lastly the Chrysler\\'s, with a tinny sound when doors closed and such. But Chrysler did other things well back when, like engines, and some cool looking cars, like the Challenger and Charger. Now you have cars based on a Mitsubishi platform, with crummy interiors and weird looks IMHO, like the Sebring, which makes me shake my head. But this doesn\\'t mean Chrysler is not a car to consider, as there are other cars within the line which could suite ya just fine. And value wise, a RWD Charger, with a 3.5 V6 is pretty reasonably priced -- and yes, we know, not a top line dash on the thing, but it is not like it is the worst thing since a Yugo.L  Oh my, you are kinda the picky one. I have noticed a change in the Camry, which was not for the better. I do not like fake aluminum colors plastic and the dash parts seemed slightly misaligned. For a Toyota, this was a shocker. That, plus the tranny problems, scared me away altogether, though I also prefer more steering feel and look for the handling aspect of a car. And my Dad has a 2000 Camry, so I already drive that a lot, so I skipped test drives when looking for my car in 2007.My 1998 Corolla had a lot of nice soft padded plastic, and looked richer than the new Corollas. Comes a time! L  RWD is no excuse. Once there is a platform, there is nothing exceptional about it being RWD or FWD. And there is absolutely no excuse for poor quality parts if the price tag is high (no wonder they can\\'t sell without massive rebates).I drove a 300 for a few hundred miles earlier this year and for most part it is a good car with decent handling and good size. The engine was 3.5/V6 which was fine and got the job done well (the mileage sucked, and thats another issue). But at the same time, the engine sounded metallic. And there in lies the problem.Besides quality issues, the focus has been all wrong. Anytime they come out with a car, the focus is on how to market hemi. And with oil price up, utter disregard for \"reality\" brings the companies back to earth.  Yes I am. Couple of weeks ago, I had to drive a friend to a Mazda dealership for a CX-7 test drive. The sales person took us to a top of the line CX-7. The first impression was very positive. The sales person kept babbling, and started to dismiss Acura RDX being sold next door. By this time, I had figured out a use for my index finger. I decided to touch the center console and it moved. I looked at the sales person and smiled. And told him, yes the RDX costs more, but you won\\'t see this in it. Sales people hate me. Camry has gone down the drain too. I was very disappointed with a rental I had late last year. I thought the green-blue trend on audio system had died earlier this decade, Toyota decided to revive it. I couldn\\'t stand it when I first saw the pictures of the Camry, and then came the first hand experience with the poorer quality.  Let me try this another way. The RWD car tends to cost more. So you can have the finer qualities of a Bimmer, as in better interior, with a super engine, like the inline six in the BMW, but price goes up. I agree, they need to work on the interiors of the Chrysler line. I was not overly impressed with the steering feel. It was better than the worst, but on the lighter side of being just right for me. Yes, Hemi is all played out by now. Seems like those Hemi engines should cost about the same to build, or less than the 3.5V6, so they do make them a good profit. Funny, so funny to see all the fat cats at auto auctions going for them - there Hemi\\'s. Recall when it was all Mustangs and Shelby\\'s and such. Always liked the \\'Cuda and Challenger, so perhaps a big mistake was not buying them when they were just another car. And the AMX? Guess it is still not as popular, but whatta looker she is. I even see more Camaro\\'s every year. It is like they are having babies, and showing up all over the place. I always loved the first generation Camaro. Actually all the Pony cars, come to think of it. But is was almost like everyone and their brother had to buy a classic Stang. If it was no so thin skinned, a 240Z would be so cool to own. Compared to the Datsun Z my 1996 Miata I owned, is an army tank in comparison to those Z cars of paper thin steel. I did think they were so cool, like having a baby Jag XKE. L  The RWD car tends to cost more.I don\\'t see why they would.  I don\\'t know the particulars, but in the past, I think it was something like $300 to $500 more for assembly. Then there is the weight issue. Will take more engineering and better materials to keep weight the same. Seems like it should not cost all that much more to build RWD, but it seems to add several thousand in the end. Wild guess, is that they run a thousand or two more to make, and sell for at least three thousand over the FWD cars? We need the engineers which were on the forum which closed down, to give some real figures here on this. And times change, so perhaps the assembly is no big deal these days. But it is in fact more costly overall to build. I am old enough to recall the days when a FWD was something quite unique. About as rare as spotting a Mini or a Citroen on the road. Maybe the retired Olds engineer has kept up with costs in building a modern day RWD and can give us some imput. A little help here!L  I don\\'t see the great fascination for RWD? Sure, it\\'s best for drag racing, but what are the other benefits? If you like RWD so much, why did you buy a FWD car (Accord right?)?  Cost depends on platform, its engineering and amortization of the costs. A high volume RWD platform may be cheaper per car than a lower volume FWD platform. It is also possible that even with same volume, a RWD platform is cheaper than FWD platform, if the latter is more advanced. Comparing costs isn\\'t quite that simple.Besides, since we see those quality issues in front drive vehicles also, the problem exists regardless.  The benchmark argument is over. Expect that any post bringing it up again will be removed.Sweeping general negative statements similar to \"you [fill in the brand] owners are [fill in the blank with something negative]\" are disruptive and useless. They also will be removed.Comments slamming other posters for their comments will also disappear. If you do not like what someone else has posted either rebut it factually instead of personally or skip it altogether. Personal comments and insults do not belong here.Once again - we are here to discuss the vehicles in this segment. We are not here to bait and taunt each other, we should be careful about reacting to baiting and taunting and we should keep our own posts on topic, meaning about the cars in this segment - not about the manufacturers and not about each other.Posts have been removed. Email me with any questions or comments.   I think that was intended as humor, because you posted: \"4cyl Mazda6 runs at about 25,500rpms at 70\".   Usually, it is first gear (or, occasionally, first two gears) with AT that revs are limited. The rest of the gears may allow you to hit redline. So it is still true. In my 1998 Accord, it will shift out of first at 5800 rpm (redline is 6300 rpm) but will go to redline in second gear (about 75 mph). Some manumatics will allow you to hold first gears thru redline too (Acura TSX\\'s does that).It sounds like Grad found the opposite, his accord shifted closer to redline in the lower gears. My Mazda6 goes to redline in both 1st and 2nd (6500), don\\'t think I\\'ll be likely to find out about the higher gears. In the 4 cyl the HP peak is also at 6500 rpm. In the manual mode, it does not up-shift automatically. Instead, if you go above redline, it cuts off the fuel supply.The shifts at about 5000 rpm, that I mentioned for a contour was not a car I owned, I had a manual trans contour, but I recall reading comments about the 4 speed auto that mentioned this. I looked up the HP peak for that engine and it was 5500 rpm and redline was, I believe, about 6500. We do have a Windstar that shifts at about 5000. For the 3.8L engine that is the HP peak also...the tach does not show a redline. That engine is \"exciting\" enough at 5000 rpm, anyway.  While it may be the latest style, bodies by ? whoever.. I really don\\'t want a vehicle that you need a periscope to look out the side windows to see what is there. Why do they even bother with the windows at all? If we have to have tanks, then so be it..but for me..NO WAY, thank you. Of course that is only my opinion and my purchase, or lack thereof won\\'t make much difference. While I am at it, I also like rear side windows that open all the way, not just the top few inches. van  I don\\'t see the great fascination for RWD?Drive a BMW 328 or a G35 and you\\'ll see. A much more appealing driving dynamic than being pulled through the turns by FWD. Especially when accelerating hard. Point and shoot. No sense of having to hand on to the wheel for dear life. Great balance.Also the main reason the next gen TLs and RLs will have it in some form.  The point is: Not all hard plastics are created equal. And there is a quality gap that can be so obvious yet, I\\'m surprised, so obscure/non-existent to many (please don\\'t take it personally).The Honda plastic is more pleasing to the eye. Thanks for taking the time to illustrate your point.  How do you have RWD in \"some form\"?  Well I have no fascination for RWD. It is a better setup for automobiles in many ways. Will add a link rather than type it all out, if I find a good site. As far as I know, I have never seen a RWD Accord for \\'07, nor any of the mid-sized cars available, so thus I bought the FWD Accord. And it is pretty darn good for handling. The bad characteristic of FWD are pretty much controlled with all the modern day electronics. In its natural form however, the RWD cars with close to 50/50 weight distribution are still the most balanced on the road. With less going on up front, tires wear better, no CV joints, trannies seem to be tougher, and when in need of repair are cheaper to work on, cornering is naturally better, and the steering is a lot more natural. FWD can feel like the car is steering you. That said, with the modern day electronic stability control and such, the FWD is more tamed down. Hopefully no gross under-steer or lockup up front on turns if you do something stupid, when you have stability control. Of course I am not of the crazy driver class, so I have had zero wrecks, while driving since the late 60\\'s. With anti-lock, stability and all that jazz, yes the FWD is closer to being a better car than ever before. I buy them because they are available, not by choice. Could not afford a Bimmer. Now as a second play toy, as in used little sports car, it WILL BE RWD. If I move to snow country, I would likely check out the Subaru Legacy, to get AWD. The coast of California has already excited the ice age. :shades: Loren  Yes, my Accord is where I am drawing the line for tall door window sills. Anything higher, and I am going used car of days gone bye. The \\'07 is tall enough. I did NOT like the too tall doors and little rear window on the Chrysler / Dodge vehicles, and it became a major negative when looking for a car. And it really is larger than a mid-size, is it not? As for the rear windows lowering all the way, I guess none seem to do that these days. L  Yes, I agree. The FWD steering tends to fight you, as in wanting to pull back the other direction with a vengeance. Current handling though of FWD cars is much improved and easier to live with. Given a choice however, I am not alone in those which would buy the RWD. I think a lot of people have forgotten what RWD is like, and need to borrow a Miata for a day, just to play (beware RWD is FWD so old skills apply) And to some FWD is natural, as they have yet to drive the RWD, unless they have driven the worse examples, such as an SUV or truck. Seeing how people drive crazy on wet road and steer at high speed with reckless abandon, it could be safer for them to own a slower handling, understeering FWD, with all the safety electronics.For those at one with the car, and paying attention to proper driving techniques, the RWD is a better choice. I recall the first time I smoked the tires with a FWD car. I thought the engine was on fire -- folks, it just ain\\'t natural. :P By some form of RWD, do you mean AWD based off the FWD as primary drive power to the wheels? Don\\'t they have that now? Loren  They do not use plastic toy quality plastics in their cars, is what people are trying to get across. Note the dash is more rubber like and softer on say the Accord for \\'07.I don\\'t know, the dash on my \\'07 Accord is about 4 different shades of the same color and the molding isn\\'t flat (you can see where each rib in the mold was). Panel gap, which I think is what they were demonstrating in the other pictures, is very good though.  Can you see the ribs under the seek button from the driver\\'s seat? I am just curious.This really wouldn\\'t bother me so much on a vehicle in this market segment. If I went to something like a Lexus (which I wouldn\\'t because I am not old enough to need a sensory deprivation chamber yet), I would expect it.  I drove a 300 for a few hundred miles earlier this year and for most part it is a good car with decent handling and good size. The engine was 3.5/V6 which was fine and got the job done well (the mileage sucked, and thats another issue). But at the same time, the engine sounded metallic. And there in lies the problem.The problem lies in the mileage? RWD cars typically have greater parasitic losses than FWD vehicles, hurting the mileage a bit.Or the problem lies in that something that is made out of aluminum, steel, and alloys sounds like it? I really don\\'t mind engine noise, I like to know there is a motor in the vehicle and that its working for me. I think that is one of the reasons I prefer the Subaru to the Accord.  Before I bought my first Accord all my cars were RWD, so I know what it feels like. Had a 72 Chevelle with a modified 69 327 Camaro engine in it, and FWD would not have worked with that car. You could hardly keep the Rear wheels from spinning. In today\\'s family cars, with under 300hp, as long as there isn\\'t much tourq steer, and you\\'re not driving like a maniac around corners, there aren\\'t any negative effects. My old 65 Pontiac (383) was definitely RWD, because I can remember changing the universal joints a few times. I haven\\'t had to change a cv joint yet (knocks on wood). If RWD is going to hurt my mileage, and take some power away, I would rather stick with FWD.In conclusion I think RWD is preferable in a sports car, but for a family sedan, FWD is fine.  Yes. That is how I discovered it.  Yes it is. And it looks great that way. It is not suppose to be the same shade. Like the central area of the dash follows on down into the center shift console as one shade of gray. Now, if a individual does not prefer that look, it is not a positive for the sale of the car.The car which has the potential to have, what I personally like in a dash look, is the New Malibu. Love the rounded look. That said, the Accord \\'07 looks very good indeed and fits the car well. The 2004 Mustang interior look is one I liked. Of course it was a bit on the cheap side, but the basic look, and feel, for that matter, is far better than a cheesy \\'05 look where they try to replicate the \\'65 Stang. Now why a \\'65 cheapo hard plastic to look somewhat like that model year, when the outside is a bloated \\'68-\\'69 combo replicar look, I haven\\'t a clue. Only Ford could answer such a thing. I would rather own the \\'04. And probably have fewer problems with it as well. Their best styling effort in recent models seems to be the \\'96. L  The only gear I can test redline with in my cars is first and second. Redline in third gear (and above) with automatics would be well past 100 mph. I think, under WOT, this is how things go in my 1998 Accord (not much different in my TL which has a 6800 rpm redline):Gear 1: 45 mph at 6300 rpm (Theoretical. In reality, it will shift around 5800 rpm)Gear 2: 75 mph at 6300 rpm (real)Gear 3: > 100 mph at redlineGear 4: will take you well past top speed, which is in 130-140 mph range, drag limited.  Just be thankful nothing falls off, nowadays. It was but a couple of decades ago, the buttons, the turn signals, the rear view mirrors and such literally fell off the cars :sick: At least the button works.... well I hope it does.  LorenP.S. Took a brief ride as a passenger in a Sebring. Glad it was brief. Anyone out their like the car? The Dodge version is shall we say cute, as a baby Charger. Maybe I am just too weird, but I though the previous version of the Sebring was a handsome car. Now technically speaking, it did not fair well in car tests - but that\\'s different that judge by looks. :shades:   ... or highway patrol limited   U joints are cheaper. Bet it cost like $100 or less to have changed out.Are they still recommending the maintenance on CV joints. Recall when they said you had to re-grease or something at x # of miles. I got a little tear in one of the boots on the Stealth, like it less than a couple of years. They wanted $100 for the part and $70 for labor. The normal however, at the time was more like $80 to $120 for parts and labor. Mitsubishi really thought well of their parts in \\'91 -- price wise, that is.I agree both FWD and RWD are fine, as is AWD in the snow belt. And yeap, I am going RWD for the sports car, if my shoulder arm and hand ever stops hurting or tingling from time to time. Can forums cause carpal tunnel syndrome? I know, I type too much. L  U joints are cheaper. Bet it cost like $100 or less to have changed out. Are they still recommending the maintenance on CV joints.There not cheaper if you never change the cv joints. 140k miles on the previous Accord and no change. I don\\'t think Honda has anything for maintenance on the cv joint. Have a co-worker with a Galant (must be a Mitsu thing), and he has changed his a few times. He says he\\'s getting better at it. Plenty of practice   Could be one of those fads in the 90\\'s. Muffler sales went down with the advent of stainless steel, so maybe they were gonna service cv joints every 40K miles, or whatever it was, just to make a buck??? If they go dry, I guess things get nasty in a few miles.Oh yeah, I test drove a Celica a few years ago, and I must say, very nice for handling. Still prefer the steering of a RWD, but as far as fun drive, they had that little car dialed in well. Guess a Mini Cooper would be fun too. :shades: have a great day, Loren  As for the rear windows lowering all the way, I guess none seem to do that these days.Don\\'t most come close, though? My Mazda6 rear windows end up with maybe an inch or so of the front half of the rear window still exposed, when all the way down. My wife\\'s Jetta is the same.  Yes it is. And it looks great that way. It is not suppose to be the same shade. Like the central area of the dash follows on down into the center shift console as one shade of gray. Now, if a individual does not prefer that look, it is not a positive for the sale of the car.Nah, I am talking about across the top of the dash, not the IP and center stack area. The airbag cover on the passenger side isn\\'t close to the same shade, and the pieces across the middle of the top aren\\'t a consistent color themselves. It was just poor quality control. I didn\\'t notice the variation until I saw it in the sunlight.  Re: Rear Windows lowering all the way: My 2006 Sonata LX does open completely into the doors...a true OPEN WINDOW.   I\\'m thinking of getting an 08 Accord Coupe V6 Auto EX-L w/Nav. I\\'m psyched that it\\'s coming out next week (obviously not psyched paying around MSRP for it, but whatever). But recently I\\'ve been getting back into Altima mode. The 08 Accord has some glaring omissions when compared to the Altima:Smart key entry (wow, standard on all models)Keyless Start (standard)Touch Screen (will have to see how good a dial knob is)semi-manual modeRear view monitor - (not sure if Honda will have this optionXenon headlightsDamn, those are some nice features. I really don\\'t know which to get. I know for sure though that I\\'m not getting the Altima Coupe or the Accord Sedan; one is too small with no rear seat room while the other is a little too big. So if I go with the Altima, I would get the sedan; with the Accord, I\\'d get the coupe. But damn, Sept 20 is rolling around. Need to decide now.  are you planning on getting the manual or auto (cvt)? if you\\'re getting the manual, the Honda is awesome. edit: oops, didn\\'t read your post too carefully; I see you plan on getting an auto. Have you tried the CVT yet? what did you think?also, does handling matter? the few articles I\\'ve read about the accord coupe\\'s suspension is that it is a bit sportier than the accord sedan, so I wonder how it would compare to the Altima...Too bad you\\'re in such a hurry...car purchasing on a time limit can be costly!  My 2007 Camry rear windows go down all the way. I think most new cars do.  I never sit in the back while driving I guess, so it is not an issue for me. Yes, would be nice if it went completely down. Now a strange one was the first SLK, which is as you know, a two seater convertible, which the windows are said to not fully lower, so thus a pain in the arm. I have not seen this in person, so I may do a little test myself, when I spot one on a lot for sale. Sounds strange to me, but I do believe a few cars do this in a coupe as well. Ouch! L  I am thinking it is most cars do not. Take a look at the typical door shape, and just how much little side window is showing. Would have to be a larger fixed little window on that door, or some great gyrations to have it disappear fully. L  Saw the 2008 Accord today. Not so impressed. I think I got a deal with the \\'07 SE V6. The 190HP EX I think it is said on the label, is the same retail price as my V6, with say a moonroof, which I do not like, and a side sticker for some coating or something, which is $500. So it tops the retail of my car, with less engine -- whoopee! The headlamps look stupid an the rear is OK. The raised hood is OK, but does nothing to help the car in the looks dept. so overall, it actually now looks smaller, is a tad larger and cost more. Oh the seats feel better on the lower back. Other than that, I am underwhelmed. I like the looks of the Civic now much better. Loren  Toyota prices -- oh my! Saw the new xD Scion today. It is $16K. It has 128HP little engine. Seems to me to be higher priced than a Corolla, or Civic, with not really great gas mileage for being a little skateboard. L  is midsize now? Oh my!  Well, as long as you also realize that \"paying extra for an Accord or Camry is brand image\" in purely YOUR OPINION then I think we can move forward and talk about these cars in an objective basis.How\\'s this for objective:Brand values in 2007, and rank:Toyota, $32,070,000,000, #6Honda, $17,998,000,000, #19Hyundai, $4,453,000,000, #72http://www.ourfishbowl.com/images/press_releases/businessweek_bgb07_article.pdfIt\\'s not my opinion. It is a well-known fact that companies with higher brand valuations can charge more for their products, even if they are equivalent to products from companies with lower brand valuations. That is the benefit of a strong brand, which Toyota and Honda have worked hard and long to build. As someone said a day or so ago, \"you get what you pay for.\" When you buy a Camry or Accord, you are getting--and paying for--a strong brand name.Let\\'s suppose though that the brand adds nothing to the price we pay for a car. So when someone pays, say, $5000 more for an Accord or Camry than for a Sonata, what do they get for their extra $5000? Where is that extra money in the car exactly? Is the plastic in the interiors $5000 better? Is the sheet metal $5000 better? The tires and wheels? The glass? The fabric or leather? The instrumentation? The electronics? The engine perhaps? You get a more powerful engine with the Accord and a more powerful V6 with the Camry, compared to the Sonata, but they are all all-aluminum, CVVT engines. Is there several thousand dollars more engine there? How about the suspension bits? How much more are the Accord\\'s and Camry\\'s worth?So you are right, I can\\'t see the extra value, but others do, and that\\'s fine because it\\'s their money. I don\\'t attack other people for finding the value in an Accord or Camry, and I don\\'t know why I should be attacked because I don\\'t see the value.P.S. I\\'d appreciate it if when you make a post that looks like you are quoting me, you would do it accurately and in context. What I actually said was:As long as you realize that a lot of what you are paying extra for on an Accord or Camry is brand image...  Between a go cart and a Cadillac, yes it is mid-sized.  I don\\'t know about that. In some cases, I guess you pay more. I found an Accord for less money than the equal in the Saturn Aura. Guess every deal is different. I thought it would cost more to get the Accord. Actually i went to Saturn first. Considering the trade-in value, the Saturn would have been $1,000 to $1500 more costly. I forgot the exact figures from Saturn in relationship to what the lowest price I was willing to accept on a trade-in. Instead of $1,500 it could have been say $1,200 difference. Anyway, like most people assume, I thought the Accord would be more pricey. It wasn\\'t. The cars seemed pretty equal. I suppose, if you feel a Sonata is the equal to an Accord or Camry, then yes it is less expensive. After looking at the 2008 Accord and the pricing, with little to no discounting, I would say if buying after the \\'o7\\'s are gone, I would be back bargaining with Saturn, Ford and perhaps Hyundai. I am not that impressed with the new look for Accord. I am thinking for 2008 models, the Milan will be the best looking, then the New Malibu/Aura, followed by the Sonata. New Mazda6 yet in 2008???The Azera would make an interesting other choice. But Hyundai resale can bite.L  Re-sale is an overated number both ways. I have two cars on opposite ends of the resale spectrum---a 2007 Camry Hybrid, and a 2004 Chevy Malibu Maxx. Obviously, I paid more for the Camry, and got less of a discount off of MSRP. However, if I were to trade it in tomorrow, I\\'d make out very well as a percentage of what I paid.I just had the Malibu Maxx assessed at CarMax. I was offered $9500 for it. Pretty bleak for a car with a $23150 MSRP, right? Well, no, actually. The MSRP was $23150, but I paid $16900 for it. And that was before my GM card discount which took another $1000 off. 56% of value for a car that is now 39 months old is not bad. In current terms, I imagine Sonata\\'s have lousy resale, but I\\'m also seeing them at huge discounts off MSRP...so if you buy one, you know you aren\\'t going to get as much...but you didn\\'t pay as much.But if you want to buy what I, at least, perceive to be a higher quality car, like an Accord or Camry, you shouldn\\'t be dissauded because of the higher price because you know you\\'ll get more for it. It is what it is.  56% of value for a car that is now 39 months old is not bad. And if you sold it on your own, you would perhaps get more...maybe 60-65%. BTW, it looks like CarMax is selling those for $13-15,000. So much for the the supposed big saving for buying used. Can\\'t imagine who would pay that much for a used \\'04, if a new one can be had for $17,000.  I was stuck in the same boat, wanted xenons,but did not like smart key/push button start, even have Nissan VPP program, but thought that Altima cut some corners with the interior. Not too thrilled that they made the accord bigger,did not really like its looks from the pictures. So I was stuck until I drove a Tl, end of story, great car.Old MIke  Is the TL priced competitively against Camcords/Fulans/Altima?  Since they start at over $30K, I\\'m thinking no...but I bet the resale value is good, on a percentage basis. Edit: Yep, there it is...intellichoice:Total 5-Yr. Ownership Cost $40,772 for TL and $38,317 for Fusion...I don\\'t believe these figures for a minute, myself.  Don\\'t know if Carmax is getting that much or just asking that much. An co-worker of mine had an absolutely cherry 2002 Malibou Classic. I mean the guy cleaned it with q-tips and mechanically perfect. Only had about 28000 miles on it. One day I noticed it wasn\\'t parked in the lot at work and I asked him where his car was. Long story short: He traded it at a local Chevy dealer and got 6000 for it. I looked on their web site and they were advertising his car as a \"special\" at 12995. Now there is some bodacious mark up.  My understanding is CarMax does not negotiate prices.  I think you make an important point that is often overlooked by people comparing \"resale values\" of cars. They look at published \"resale value percentages\" and see that a car like the Accord or Camry has a higher percentage than a car like the Malibu, and immediately assume that they will make out better financially when it comes time to sell an Accord or Camry. But as your example shows, that\\'s not necessarily the case, if they get a good deal up front. Resale value is about the money, not percentages, when all is said and done.If someone likes a car like an Accord or Camry better than the alternatives, that\\'s what they should buy, and they will probably enjoy owning it. But they should do so not counting on saving money at re-sale time compared to lower-priced alternatives like the Malibu et. al.  My 2007 Camry rear windows go down all the way. I think most new cars do.The rear windows in our 2007 AWD SEL Ford Fusion do not go all the way down. It bugs me.  I know very few cars where the rear windows roll down all the way. I can\\'t think of the last time I owned a car where they did.  \"Let\\'s suppose though that the brand adds nothing to the price we pay for a car.

The tires and wheels?\"Better engine, better interior, better layout, better engineering, better gas mileage, better dealer service, better wheels, better manufacturer, better transmission and higher wages. Probably due to pay differences between American and Korean workers. Lower cost to repair from certain accidents. This may be worth $5K to certain people.  Our 1993 Accord did, that\\'s the last car I remember us having that did that besides our Chrysler convertibles.  There can be other qualities that aren\\'t necessarily quantifiable. Nobody should have to justify their purchase. If you like it, and paid what you feel is a fair price, then you win.  If someone likes a car like an Accord or Camry better than the alternatives, that\\'s what they should buy, and they will probably enjoy owning it.That\\'s really what it\\'s all about, Backy. Well said. Camry and Accord are fine mid-size sedans, no doubt. They both have good reputations and a loyal following.We liked the Ford Fusion better, so that\\'s what we bought. We generally keep our cars 7 to 10 years, so resale is not that big of a factor either.  I don\\'t think resale is all it\\'s cracked up to be anyway. For some it will help, for other it won\\'t. There are a lot of factors that will affect resale. What kind of shape the car is in, how many miles are on it, how you sell it (dealership will try to screw you no matter what car it is, and will give you more if your a regular customer regardless of what vehicle it is) and the many, many unknowns between when you buy and when you sell. In 5 years a car companies fortunes could drasticly change. resale probably helps if you flipping vehicles every couple years, but in that case you\\'d proably be better off leasing.  >The Aura sales did not increase one iota because of the comparisons at dealer lots. WSJ:The move had little impact on Aura sales, and GM has now ended the effort.\"Little\" is different from \"not one iota.\" Do you have another source for that statement?  Do the Fusion windows open almost all the way like the Mazda6? What about others who say theirs do not open all the way?  Do the Fusion windows open almost all the way like the Mazda6, shown below?No illustration showed up on my computer but the glass sticks up about 4 inches above the window sill.  No illustration showed up on my computer but the glass sticks up about 4 inches above the window sill. Look again, you should see it now...it took me a few tries to get the image to work. But 4 inches would obviusly be a lot more than the Mazda.  My 03 Accord sedan rear windows do not go all the way down. The position of the rear doors in relation to the rear wheel usually reduces clearance, so either you get a short window (back to front), or the wider window will not go all the way down. Usually you end up with about the same size window opening.  The car was never worth $23,150 to begin with. It was perhaps a nice value in the $18,000+ to perhaps $19,000 range. You got it for $16,900 before other considerations for the card rebate, which aside of normal price without having a credit card from GM. So you got a bit of a discount. The 23,150 is more what I would expect to pay for a V6 Camry or other Japan make. It is price, as in real value of the car, in and out, which is most important. Look, the Sonata is a nice car, but quite a Japan make yet. Let\\'s call it an 85% car, and instead of paying 24,500 for Japan make, you paid 20,825 you are about even before resale consideration. You buy it for $19,600, it is pretty small discount, when considering the resale value. Would more likely have to go below $19K on the buy price, invest the difference spent in some stocks, or take other considerations, like the long warranty, to get too much ahead on that deal. It is all in how you look at it. If the car is 110% in your eyes, then yeah, such a deal it was. The Malibu Maxx was the most interesting of those models. Sort of a car which could be a keeper, as there are so few of them around, I bet people give it the eye some times. And it was not only different, I personally liked the look more than the regular sedan - bet others did too. GM had overpriced it though, which I think would shy people away. L  Better engineYes, the Accord has more power than the Sonata, and the Camry V6 has more power. How else are their engines better than the Sonata\\'s? Personally, 6.6 seconds 0-60 and 147 mph top speed is more power than I need, so I\\'m not willing to pay extra for more power.better interiorI like the looks (based on photos) of the Accord\\'s interior better than the Sonata\\'s, although I don\\'t like the Camry\\'s interior all that much. But the difference is not something I\\'d pay extra for.better layoutI like the layout of the Sonata just fine. The controls are very intuitive. I don\\'t see those on the Camry or Accord being better to the extent I\\'d pay extra for it.better engineeringCare to quantify that?better gas mileageActually the fuel economy numbers are very close. So that\\'s worth some $$$ over time, but a fraction of $5000, to me at least.Sonata: I4 MT 21/31, I4 AT 21/30, V6 AT 19/28Camry: I4 MT 21/31, I4 AT 21/31, V6 AT 19/28Accord: I4 MT 22/31, I4 AT 21/31, V6 AT 19/29better dealer serviceHighly variable. There are excellent (and poor) Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai dealers.better wheelsHow so? Some models of Accord, Camry, and Sonata have steel wheels. How are those significantly different? For the alloys, I find those on the Sonata very sharp-looking. I wouldn\\'t pay extra for other wheels.better manufacturerHow are they better, and that helps you how?better transmissionIf the new Accord\\'s MT is as good as in the past, then I see an advantage there but not one I\\'d pay extra for since I would almost certainly get an AT on this class of car. And on that, I hope that Honda doesn\\'t repeat the problems they had on the AT on the previous-generation Accord, for which the AT was recalled. The Sonata\\'s ATs are smooth and offer manual shift, so it\\'s not a difference I\\'d pay extra for.higher wages. Probably due to pay differences between American and Korean workersSonatas sold in the U.S. are made in the U.S. What are the comparative wages between U.S. Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai workers?Lower cost to repair from certain accidentsSince I pay the same deductible no matter what brand I own, that is moot except wrt insurance costs. And there is some difference there, but it would have to be substantial to get close to making up a $5000 difference.This may be worth $5K to certain people.Yes, I agree, some people will happily pay $5000 or more (actually much more counting interest or opportunity costs) for the factors you mentioned or others. And as I said, it\\'s their money. I happen to have other uses for mine.   Had the Opportunity to take an EX-I4 5spd manual out for a test run yesterday up in Chicago, IL.Exterior:When I first saw spy shots of the Accord, I actually liked the front end and I thought it was more agressive and bolder than the 7th generation Accord. In person I still like the new front end better than the current model but I was a little less impressed with it. The lights themselves give me a 98-02 Accord feel and go back to the \"Accord\" look that most of us remember but I don\\'t like the fact that the lights stick out on the sides of the car. I\\'ll also say that I find the Accord looks a LOT like the Sonata from the front when you see it in person and I think that\\'s mainly because the Accord finally has a real \"grill\" and that the Sonata and Accord share similarly designed headlights. (But the Accord\\'s from way back in 1990 had them first IMO) The bulging headlights give the Accord a \"bug eyed\" look from the side..almost like the car is wearing huge eyeglasses or something. I also think it\\'s a shame that Honda doesn\\'t make fog lights standard on LX-P and EX-14 models because the agressive front end looks strange without the fog lights found on V6 models. The area where the fog lights would go looks like an afterthought. I do find the side profile of the Accord attractive and I particularly like the chrome accented door handles on V6 models. The car has a more upscale look to it than previous Accords. I don\\'t have much of an opinnion on the rear end, it\\'s neither bad nor great in my eyes so I\\'ll say that\\'s a good thing considering I didn\\'t like the 03-05 rear at all.Funny thing is, I like the LX-Ps 16 inch alloys better than the EX model\\'s 17s. :surprise: Interior:I have always been a fan of the 7th gens interior and I do like the 08s as well. The 7th\\'s was more simplistic and better designed IMO. Honda also dropped the electrolumincent gauges for 08 which is a shame. The gauges do look sportier than the 03-07s though.The interior materials are a solid mix of soft and hard plastics. The top of the dashboard in particular has some very hard plastics yet they don\\'t look cheap at all. The radio controls, interior door knobs and center console are similar in design and feel to the Civic. The materials are no better IMO than the 7th gen which isn\\'t a problem considering the 7th gen was the best in it\\'s class (only the Passat is better) The cloth seats of the EX I drove reminded me of the cloth found in the 1990-91 Accord (anybody remember those days?) I liked them because they were supportive and comfortable and a lot better than the c cloth found in my 2005 Altima. The cloth had a \"suede\" feel to it that Accord haven\\'t had since the glory days of the early 1990s.I didn\\'t sit in the back seat, but I did look back there and the car appeared to be roomier than previous generations. LX and LX-P models are Full size sedans and EX models are midsize. I will say that the back seat of the Accord didn\\'t look any roomier than my Altima 2.5S.Features:From what I could see Honda hasn\\'t really added any \"techy\" features to the Accord as opposed to the 7th gen. Bluetooth is only available on navigation models, push button isn\\'t offered at all and HIDs aren\\'t either. I don\\'t really expect them to be considering a top of the line Accord is still $2000 less than the comparable CamTima. On the safety front Honda has finally caught up with the Sonata by offering VSA standard on all models, which is great IMO.Transmission/Engine:Like always Honda delivers BIG on engine/transmission refinement. The engine is smooth and has lots of power when you need it. I never felt at anytime that I needed to rev the car up to get it\\'s power. The engine is QUIET though, so quiet that a couple of times I\\'d stop and have to push the gas to even realize the car was running. The shifter is smooth as silk and has the usual Honda precision that you expect. The feel and linkage of the shifter is much better than what Nissan has to offer and I think only Mazda comes close or exceeds the feel of the Accord\\'s shifter.Ride:Seeing as I live in the city of Chicago now I didn\\'t get the opportunity to drive the car out on highways and Interstates like I would in Spartanburg, SC so all of my driving impressions where on city streets. The streets of Chicago are ROUGH but not as bad as say NYC. That didn\\'t stop the Accord from riding quite well through the city streets though. The ride is still firmer than say a Camry, but it\\'s a little less form than past Accords I have tested. Potholes and crevices in the road where taken with stride and the car always remained composed with little if any jiggle.Overall:I\\'m very impressed with the car and I find it still to be a class leader. I\\'ve never really considered a Sonata because I don\\'t like it\\'s interior nor do I like the styling but I\\'m going to give it a test drive next weekend to compare. So far I\\'d still rate the Accord higher than the Altima, Camry (including the SE) and Optima and I\\'d only wish that Honda would add more techy features to the Accord (bluetooth w/o navigation, fog lights, push button start, etc.) but other than that I really did like the car. It is bigger, but doesn\\'t feel any bigger when you drive it (it\\'s not Avalon-ish IMO)So if ever 7th gen. Accords (or any previous generations) were considered benchmarks, I\\'d say the new one continues that tradition.  \"Yes, I agree, some people will happily pay $5000 or more (actually much more counting interest or opportunity costs) for the factors you mentioned or others. And as I said, it\\'s their money. I happen to have other uses for mine. \"Yes, I am one of those people who believe I\\'m getting the $5K worth \"betterness\" for the reasons I mentioned. $5K over 7 years of ownership is a small price to pay for a vehicle I have to live in day in and day out.For me the $5K over many years would be a non-issue, but I realize for some how it could be an issue.  I understand. For some folks $5k or even $10k (actual cost of $5k today, over many years) is a small price to pay for the \"betterness\" they see in a car. Someday, when I\\'m done paying tuition costs for my 3 kids and funding my 401k to the hilt to prepare for early retirement, I may feel the same way.   You gave a very good review. Thanks! When I saw the new Accord, I was happy to have bought the current model. Just to not like the inside or the outside as well, though the seats feel a tad bit better. As for the exterior when compared to the Sonata, Hyundai now wins, IMHO. Oh course, just on looks, the Fusion/Milan looks kinda cool. The Altima I have finally gotten tired of. The interior foot brake is not anything I would want, nor is having a CVT transmission. Guess you could get a stick. To me it seems Altimas are overpriced these days. The look is no longer all that fresh anyway. They are relying too much these days for styling by plastic headlamp and tail lights for changes. Some like the Accord bugged-out eyes, are just awful. L  Look they are not going to give you a SAME car for $5K less money. The cost to build is way too close for anyone to be able to do so. Once again, a Sonata is a good car, but it is not a same car. And only a fool pays retail sticker for any car, including a Sonata. (OK rare occasions the stick is a fair value - in mid-sized cars reviewed here all should have discounts available ) There are always ways to save money, be it buying a used car, buying the next smaller car, or buying lesser car. An Impala costs less than a CTS, but then again, it is a lesser car. Will save you over $10K to do so however, if costs savings is the goal. L  There\\'s huge differences between an Impala and a CTS--not just price. They are different classes of cars entirely. Within this mid-sized family car class, the differences are much smaller.If saving money is the goal, you can buy a real nice 2007 Taurus for around $10k, or a year or two older for even less. But it\\'s not just saving money--it\\'s getting a car you like and that meets your needs, for as little money as possible.  BINGO! It is all about the car. If a person truly believes their car is the same as some other more expensive car, and are very well happy with it, then it is in fact the best deal for that individual, in that they are pleased. Now to convince people of some difference between their cars and others is going nowhere. So I am dropping it as of today. On a different note about these mid-sized cars, I do believe looks wise the Sonata is a contender. Some are saying the new Accord has a Sonata like front. Well, it may, but dang what is up with those eyes. Now I am thinking they are giving an advantage to other makes, Hyundai included, by just going to strange. Base solely on looks the Sonata is now looking better than is the Accord. I almost forgot the \"Most Improved Award\" in stying award. This must be awarded to the person or persons at Subaru which finally got at least a decent look to the cars, such as the Legacy. In some colors, in my opinion, it looks rather nice, when compared to all the rest in class. And thank God, they changed the Tribeca. Whew! :surprise: Anyway, the Sonata looks good to me, as did the previous generation design. In the looks department, one could say to their eye, she is better looking than the Big Two, or is that Three Japan makes. Of course that is subjective.  L  And keep in mind the Sonata is due for a major re-fresh next spring. (Just in time, with the new Accord, Malibu, and Mazda6 here or coming soon.) Rumors are it will include a Genesis-inspired front end and a Veracruz-inspired dash. And I\\'m betting it will also include some powertrain tweaks, since the horsepower wars for family cars continue unabated. :sick:  ...since the horsepower wars for family cars continue unabated.That is something that just makes no sense to me. I know it\\'s a fact but it still makes no sense.  I just went to my local dealer (which is literally down the hill from my house). The dealership was closed, but I found two unlocked examples; an LX-P and an EX cloth (4-cyl). I came back with results I didn\\'t expect. For those who don\\'t know by the way, I have a \\'96 LX Accord and an \\'06 EX cloth Accord. Size/Exterior: The car looks stately, grown up, but still looks aggressive (more aggressive than my 06). From inside the driver\\'s seat, the car didn\\'t feel noticeably longer, but I did notice the extra width big time (a good thing to a big guy like me). The LX-P\\'s wheels sure look small when compared to the others\\' now. Interior: I spent most of my seat time in a silver LX-P. First, the plusses... Good headroom, kneeroom, and I think the rear seat would almost be bearable for three with the extra hip and shoulder room. Five across in my 2006 model is tight, and darn near impossible in my 1996. The gauges are gorgeous (and weren\\'t even lit up, mind you). Nice detailing; a definite classy upgrade from my 06 (although my 06 is ultra-legible, so I\\'ll call it a wash). For the cons... The wonderful dampened-tactile feel present in the previous Accords is almost gone. Push a power window switch and you meet a very stiff and cheaper feeling \"click\" as opposed to the more damped switches in my 06. The LX-P\\'s fan-speed knob had LOTS of play (I could wiggle it up and down and change its gaps in a major way - HUGE disappointment to me). The seat fabric was nice, but overall, I am glad I only have 24,455 miles on my 2006 model. That way I can drive it a long time, then go back to the drawing board in picking a model of car once again. The Accord may offer more features for the dollar than they once did, but the interior quality seems to have suffered because of it. For giggles, I sat in a 2006 Malibu Maxx on the used lot; it did make me feel a LOT better about the 2008 Honda. I got in the car and I swear I heard birds going \"cheeep cheeep cheeep.\" The short version? Well, I\\'m not a Honda fanboy/diehard owner, but I do really like my Accords. I am a little let down by this model. They improved some things in my eyes (exterior styling on both sedan and coupe, more power AND same/better economy) while shooting themselves in the foot on one of its previously best traits - interior feel (the fit and finish were good, but it felt a lot more like an Altima than a Honda, NOT a good thing to me.  awesome comprehensive review... thanks!  The wonderful dampened-tactile feel present in the previous Accords is almost gone. Push a power window switch and you meet a very stiff and cheaper feeling \"click\" as opposed to the more damped switches in my 06.Interesting... that was one of my few criticisms/ nitpicks of the 2006 Sonata I rented a few months back; the buttons, especially the ones on the steering wheel, felt brittle and hollow. My Mazda has buttons that are pretty well dampened yet positive. I doubt my buying decision would ever be affected by the tactile feel of buttons, but it\\'s just something that I noticed.  I doubt my buying decision would ever be affected by the tactile feel of buttons, but it\\'s just something that I noticed. Nor would mine, but I didn\\'t drive one, remember. All I have to go on right now is the quality of the interior and styling of everything. I\\'m hoping for Honda\\'s sake that this was an anomaly.  I looked at two 08 Accords at the local dealer today. I could not get inside, to touch the buttons, but the materials looked to be the same as my 03 interior. The seats look like the same type of leather and the dash material looked the same, as far as look and texture. Don\\'t know why they would change the way the buttons operate, but I guess it could happen. Neither car had the body side molding on them, which is good since those moldings kill the profile look of the car, and probably do little to prevent door dings. I like the looks and the extra interior space, but not nearly enough to trade my 03 for one. Maybe generation 9 or 10 will be enough to change my mind, but I doubt it.  By coincidence I drove past my local Honda dealer today also, and I saw lots of 2008 Accords lined up outside so I took a look. These were all locked, but they had at least one of everything: LX, LX-P, EX, EX V6, and EX V6 with nav. I was rather surprised at how many they had in stock. The rush to be the first on the block with a 2008 Accord hasn\\'t materialized I guess.Exterior-wise, I was impressed most by the side view. It looks very BMW-ish to me, and even the LX has fat chrome window trim. The rear was OK, nothing stood out (except for a couple of cars with misaligned trunk lids). The front will take some getting used to. It seems such a departure from Accords of the past, with its huge upright grille and bulbous headlamps. I saw a Caliber in the parking lot and there was a resemblence. I agree with a previous post that the front looks better with the fog lamps on the EX V6. Another thing I saw that I\\'m not used to seeing on Hondas is considerable orange peel on the paint, noticeable on the darker colors (they had white, grey, black, and red on the lot--the red was pretty sharp with a deep metallic finish). The 16\" and 17\" alloys looked good, but the wheel covers on the LX screamed \"pay the extra $1000 and get the LX-P!\" Another sign of decontenting is the lack of side mouldings. Many cars are taking those off lately, but I haven\\'t noticed people are more careful these days swinging their doors open in parking lots. On the interior, overall I was disappointed. The EX interiors looked pretty good with the wood trim, but it looked better in photos to me. It\\'s not an ugly interior by any stretch, but just didn\\'t \"wow\" me. I was surprised that even on the $25k EX there\\'s a plastic steering wheel. It also appears Honda has gone to the plastic door handles used by most other cars in this class now. They have a aluminum look to match the trim, but it\\'s clear they are painted plastic (or a poor quality aluminum!). On the LX and LX-P, there\\'s a lot of black plastic but the fabric looked nice, especially the tan. The sticker didn\\'t mention if the LX has a seat height adjuster, and I didn\\'t see a lever on the seat edge. Does it have one (manual)?The dash looked \"cheaper\" to me than the one on the 2003-2007 Accord. The gauges looked clear but nothing special. Maybe they look better at night. The center stack seemed logically laid out, although with a lot of small buttons. Even if the 3-knob HVAC controls are ominpresent, I prefer them (if well damped) for their utter simplicity. I know I will get a lot of flak for saying this, but I actually prefer the dash on the Elantra to the Accord\\'s dash.I am hoping this dealer will have an \"Accord open house\" like they did for the new Fit so I can drive a few of the new Accords and see if the driving experience wows me more than the visual tour. For now, from looks alone, I think the new Accord is just a small step forward for Honda, mostly due to the extra interior room and the addition of features like ESC, active headrests, and audio controls on the steering wheel across the board. If the ride is smoother without hurting handling, as some have reported, that would be a big step forward IMO.  Just out of curiosity, do you think that Honda will be criticized by the various car mags for the location of the hvac vents in the center stack like Hyundai was when the current-gen Sonata came out? :confuse:  Are you kidding? I really can\\'t fathom why Hyundai got so much flak over the vent position on the Sonata. I\\'ve driven that car a lot and the placement is just fine for me. It\\'s easy to direct the flow into the cabin so it doesn\\'t blow on the driver\\'s right hand. That isn\\'t easy to do with some cars. And I know of several other vehicles that have vents in almost exactly the same position, and I didn\\'t see any snipes in reviews about it.I was interested to see though that in C/D\\'s long-term wrapup of the Sonata, they were very positive about the interior and didn\\'t say anything about vent placement.  do you think that Honda will be criticized by the various car mags for the location of the hvac vents in the center stackMy previous Accord and Acura both were pathetic in their ability to direct the center vent\\'s air flow toward my face, so any kind of change in this area will be a huge plus. Altima doesn\\'t seem to have a problem directing air toward your face.  The Aura\\'s increase in sales were due to deep discounting and big time rebates, not the comparison.  I like the air vent pointed directly at the rear ceiling area (straight out), to circulate the air in the whole car. My wife likes them pointed right at her. We can accomplish both with the 03 Accord vents. The vent position would definitely be a point of interest for me, when test driving an 08 Accord. Since I don\\'t want NAV, I would rather have the vents in the middle, and at the top.  Rumors are it will include a Genesis-inspired front end Does that mean Sonata\\'s front end will no longer look like 1998 Accord?   The Aura\\'s increase in sales were due to deep discounting and big time rebates, not the comparison.Did you interview everyone who bought an Aura? Of course not, so how do you know?! Perhaps it was a combination of things... a competent car, nicely styled design, big rebates, and a good comparison to its competitors as represented by the camry and accord in their showrooms? I\\'m sorry, but your continuous spouting of things you don\\'t know and/or couldn\\'t know is just annoying. IMO, of course.  I have to say that the vents in the Mazda6 are pretty unique in that they are circular and will rotate 360 degrees with deflectors that move like shutters which allows for great control of where air is directed. Generally, I don\\'t really care for these things, but now that I have it, it is very nice. And having 3 vents in the center stack is great for the backseat occupants since some of these vents can be directed toward them easily while the front seat occupants can still get direct air from the side vents. Of course having vents in the center storage are like some cars would be better... are there cars in this class that have these?  Never thought of it as the Honda Accord style of \\'98, but you are right. Does look a bit \\'98, which is a good thing - right? In looking back in time, some designs were just a bit better looking. It is almost like they are now trying too hard to make something striking, and coming up with the plain ol\\' weird. What\\'s up with this strange bug eyes on the new Accord? They stick out so much, I wonder if they are a target in a wreck. :surprise: Gosh, the Sonata may look plain to some, but I am thinking more like it is plainly a better look than many. The front nose of a Camry, is well just wrong, and the side view is not too exciting, as it is looking a bit chunky. But overall, it is something better than the previous Camry, but then again, anything would be. I am thinking Honda and Toyota may be giving the competition a little break these days. The GM Malibu is going to look even better, the Sonata pics, I have yet to see, the Altima is still stylin\\' but perhaps some, like I am, are getting tired of the look to a degree (still good). Should make the Fusion / Milan look better too. Ford just needs the make a little change or two here or there in the interior to jazz it up, and I guess they get a new V6, so heck may be a contender. Heck, I always liked most of the stuff Honda was doing each year, but the new exterior and interior look sure doesn\\'t do it for me. But then again, I already bought a sedan. So they made a sale. I was shopping several cars at the time, then got it down to Aura and Accord. But this 2008 Accord, would probably not have been in the race. It is all subject, this how good a car looks, but to me a lot of the new redesigns just look garbled, awkward, and less flowing or continuing as a form. The 2007 Accord to some is not a work of art. I realize this, but it seemed to have a smoothness to it, and it worked for me as a car which looked well, front - side & back as I walked around it. And it seemed to look like its own design and not an accumulation of other designs. The nose is simple, but kinda sporty for a sedan. Same thing with the New CTS, it seems to be taking on a corporate nose, which is not fitting to the Art & Science simple chisels, and the side view now looks off too. Something of some mismatches. The trunk and rear doesn\\'t seem to be as CTS or stand-outish. I had a long day of getting my Aunt up and running with a new computer and new ISP service, so the brain is not firing as fast, so perhaps I am not getting this through as in expressing correctly. Maybe it is just me, asI look at the making of a design change as having to actually improve on the previous, or be so much a better replacement, it was worth the effort. The New Accord is kinda like three car designs, we all have seen, grafted together. The interior got more busy, and is now less attractive. The CTS exterior, IMHO, is now way too busy up front, but the interior is nice - very nice. Alas, it too lost a bit of Art & Science along the way, so maybe they could inject a bit of quirky, just for old times sake. :P LorenP.S. I am not saying the CTS is not attractive in a way. Just saying it is not in a CTS way attractive, as in original theme, and to me personally, no longer has the impact it once did. Many will love the new look and it should sell well.  If you do the math. In retail sales, it was something like 800 or so more cars sold. Nothing earthshaking. Deeper discounts is a likely scenario. Yes, Aura XR is pretty nice little package. Should be very interesting to see how the New Malibu sales are, once it hits the showrooms, and how the G6 and Aura\\'s will fare.goodnight from the left coast, Loren  Does that mean Sonata\\'s front end will no longer look like 1998 Accord?2008 Accord looks like current Sonata. :P  I don\\'t think so. The only similarity seems to be sharper inside corners of the headlamps, and that is a contemporary design element seen in a boat load of cars. Is it really that different from, say, what you see in TL, TSX, Civic, or several Japanese Hondas? In fact, it isn\\'t too different from 1990-1993 Accord\\'s headlamp with a contemporary touch. But here is the other Honda (Japanese) from which Accord gets its headlamps:They are virtually identical. As for the grill, I don\\'t see any similarity there. As I said earlier, 2005+ Sonata\\'s grill is more like a touched up grill from 1998 Accord. I even see similar \"bulge\" around the outline of the grill. Take a closer look at 1998 Accord, side by side, and you might see that. If 2008 Accord makes you think Sonata, perhaps it is because there is a 1998 Accord-look in it. \"What Goes Around, Comes Around\". Take a look at the Hyundai I30 revealed at Frankfurt just a few days ago. When I saw that grill, I thought \"Civic\". Perhaps, in a few years from now, if Honda maintains/evolves the Civic that even remotely mimics 2006 version, people will be saying... that looks like a Hyundai!Of course, 1998 Jaguar S-Type looks like a 2000 Hyundai Sonata too.   What\\'s up with this strange bug eyes on the new Accord?I agree. It is a carry over from similar effect on CR-V and Odyssey. Some other cars (Lexus GS) have it too. And I think it is limited to sedan only. Accord Coupe has it conventionally styled (Honda Stream, pictured above, doesn\\'t either).  I love those round vents in the mazda6. Disappointing to seem them dropped from the center dash in the new version. I like that I can instantly see where they are aimed and if they are open or not, with just a quick glance. I also think they are a little quicker and easier to change the aim on or shut off than the conventional type.The Mazda6 has rear seat heat ducts...but, I am not even sure where they are. My wife\\'s Jetta, not quite in this class, has rear vents in the center storage area. Based on that, I assume that the Passat would also have that feature.  Although I didn\\'t read all the replys between this post by you and the most current posts I will \"stick up\" for urnews in as much you post several pictures and tell us it from \"so-and-so\" year and model. We are supposed to see certain faults with fit and finish (I guess) and while I do see some gaps I cannot tell without seeing the whole dash, or whatever total piece this snippet is supposed to represent, if the parts fit well or not. I cannot tell the overall design and therefore cannot tell if certain gaps are faults...or not. Further I cannot feel the plastics, if that is what your beef is. As far as I know you could have visited 10 dealers and looked at 100 cars to find a flaw to prove your point. You cannot post a snapshot of something that could be a 57 Ford and use it as \"proof\" a Camry or Accord is wonderful. I don\\'t even care for the current crop of Chrysler cars but I see flaws with your reasoning in using this as some sort of proof. Having read all the posts in between it seems this photo as proof thing has faded into the past. Therefore my post is old news. Sorry I really should not post first and read later....  The Aura\\'s increase in sales were due to deep discounting and big time rebates, not the comparison.Let me know when you get some ACTUAL evidence of this.My sister, who is a CPA, went to a local Saturn dealer, just to see what the comparison was about. She was amazed that for slightly more than $21K, she could get a well-equipped Aura XE with a V6, compared to a 4-cylinder in the Camry and Accord. She was just as impressed with the fit-and-finish, interior materials, and the drive/ride of the Aura as with the Accord. Two days before, she was able to talk down a \\'07 Accord V6 to $24K (including the $1K rebate from Honda), similarly equipped, and was ready to sign the papers until she bought the Saturn.Oh, and for the record, Saturn did NOT offer any \"deep discounting\" or any \"big time rebates\". And IMO, after driving her new Aura a few times, they don\\'t need to.  If in-store comparison helped Aura, why would GM not continue it. They had also announced to do it with the new Malibu but suddenly retracted (and interestingly enough, this coincided with the launch of the new Accord). Given the timing of events, I conclude that GM didn\\'t think it was a good idea to pit the new Accord against Aura and new Malibu. The comparison worked well using a model that was four-five years old.  I cannot tell the overall design and therefore cannot tell if certain gaps are faults...or not. Further I cannot feel the plastics, if that is what your beef is.I posted the pictures (not louiswei). That said, if you can\\'t tell the difference, or get a feel for it from it, then let us agree upon one thing... our standards for quality is different. I won\\'t settle for something like that in anything above $15K, and won\\'t be happy with it even in a car that costs less.  The comparison worked well using a model that was four-five years old....And a new-for-\\'07 Camry. A MT COTY Camry I might add.I\\'m not sure why GM discontinued it for the Malibu. I\\'m simply saying that although it may not have created a huge jump in Aura sales (at least in the eyes of GM), it DID help some consumers to make a smarter decision (in their own eyes) in terms of purchasing a car. Incidentally, the salesperson at the Saturn dealer said that a fair amount of people did test-drive all three models, and at least 90% of them picked the Aura over the Camry and Accord. Not only owners of current Saturns, but also Honda, Toyota, and Nissan owners as well.  Well she may be a CPA, but she is not too sharp with the car buying. I bought the Accord SE V6 for 22,500, which is a SOHC vs. OHV engine with more HP, and a five speed, instead of a four speed tranny. I have stability control and a 6CD changer. The ride may be softer in the XE, but it seems pretty close to me. That slightly more than $21K is gonna cost much more than the less than $22,500 I paid when you go to sell, and I have the one grade above the other car. She needed to talk to me first, the CIB, a Certified Individual Buy  The interior is better on the \\'07 Accord than the Aura, BTW, and a bit more room inside as well. The Aura is a tad bit narrow, and the knee hits the dashboard. Overall, it is not a bad car, just not the best example of an Aura. The Aura XR, if bought around $22K is not a bad deal, though the total in and out will not be as good as the Accord or Camry.Loren CIB  Last Friday while our Civic was in the shop I drove a 2008 Accord LX-P. I never drove an Accord before so everything was new to me and this post is based on my prior lack of knowledge about them. I liked the side profile which has a BMW like \"character\" line along the flanks. Same for the side window shape. I can\\'t recall anything about the rear so it must have been unremarkable..neither great nor horrible. The front was a different story and overall I did not like it. For some reason it reminded me of the Pilot truck all chunky with a large opening down low and having a big rectangular grid within. The front didn\\'t do it for me. The interior was comfortable and it rode smoothly and quietly but it WAS a new car so I expected it would. I didn\\'t care too much for the large display center in the center of the dash...why? I can\\'t say really but it just struck me as being too large for the information displayed within. Some areas of the interior reminds me of our 2006 Civic. The steering wheel has much the same design and feel with the same buttons for the same features, the glove box door has what looks to me to be the same latch handle as the one on the Civic.  I was interested in the performance aspect and the base 177hp I-4 engine did perform well and one can expect the 190hp 4cyl to be pretty good as well. But until I see published documented numbers I\\'ll remain neutral on that since only 2lb/ft.of torque separate the two. I did not drive the V-6 and aside from the 3-4-6 cylinder deactivation feature, which may be a gimmick depending on your point of view, I expect it be quick as well. I am trying to wean myself off V-6\\'s which is why I am starting to pay more attention to the I-4 cylinders offered by everyone and for now Honda has, I believe, the most powerful. New EPA sticker numbers are now down to what may be \"real world\" if one is honest in reporting what that really is. The salesperson was quick to point this out saying most (many) people will still exceed those EPA numbers...maybe.  In all it was merely OK and I intend to try the 190hp version as soon as one becomes available. For now I think I will wait until the freshened Sonata shows up which in view of the sticker prices on the several Accords I looked at may be a bigger bargain (define that as you see fit but don\\'t tell me I am wrong) than ever...either that or a diesel version of \"something\" shows up. Finally, we bought a 2006 Civic, one that was a completely new design and have endured quite a few \"un-Honda like\" problems so buying a first year redesign again doesn\\'t do it for me. I think our Civic has colored my perception of Honda \"quality\" anyhow.  So why did GM say it did not help sales, then discontinue using the program? It was also interesting how they ended up with two i4 engine Japan makes, when both are available for around $24K retail, before discounting with some extras on them. Perhaps one wishing to get an idea on the features and goodness of brand X car, with little knowledge of what to look for, was fair game. From what I saw at my local dealership, I would have had to have them get a car elsewhere for it to be a deal. Their cars were all loaded with extras, then they had a side sticker for window etching for security and pin stripes added on. Some fools may fall for those two items. When they offered to get an Aura XR in base, without any additional equipment they offered a discount, then took it away on a lower price for a trade-in. Ford offered more, and Honda offered more. L  As I have stated I do not even care for recent Chrysler cars and therefore I am not defending them but for all I know you looked at 100\\'s of cars to find (and photograph) the worst possible panel mis-match in an attempt to use it as some sort of evidence. Conversely maybe this is the first you looked at and just happened to have your camera along. If you think everyone here can look at a snippet of an overall component and be able to tell how that little piece relates to the whole you are wrong. That pretty much is what urnews questioned...what is this and what am I supposed to see? Don\\'t paint us all as cretins who don\\'t see anything relating to good verses poor quality even when a nice photo has been provided.  Someone would have to be pretty high up in the GM food chain to know the real reason why the Accord/Camry side-by-side comparisons with Aura and Malibu were canceled.The most logical reason, of course, is that the comparo didn\\'t produce the desired results: significantly improved sales. I thought it was a pretty bold move and one that demonstrated a whole lot of confidence on GM\\'s part. It is strange, however, that the plan was canned after such a short time.  I\\'d suspect any promotion like that has a limited life of effectiveness. It was time for a change.  maybe the real reason is that somebody somewhere figured out that the American car buyer is getting too smart for these \\'sponsored\\' comparos. Are you listening Ford?  Yeah, but if I were interested in one or more of the compared vehicles, I wouldn\\'t give a hoot. I\\'d just use it as an opportunity to drive each vehicle in one spot. Nevermind the disparity in equipment on the displayed models - I can look up the options packages myself. I know they\\'re going to \"dumb down\" the competition, but why not give it a whirl?Of course the new Edge comparo makes me skeptical. So far I\\'ve seen just one commercial, over and over, with the same lady who preferred the Ford.  Better to look like a 1998 Accord, with a clean, classic front end, than look like a Dodge or Suzuki, which the new Accord looks like to me in front.Also, the headlamps on the photo of the Japanese Accord are much smaller than those on the U.S. Accord. Those lamps are HUGE, and stick way out from the sides. \"The better to see me with, my dear\", I guess.   hi Kirstie. If a person prefers a V6 and larger wheels, and such, the test comparo simply did not work. I did test, at Honda, both the i4 and V6. Both seemed great to me, however if you want the acceleration of a V6, or larger wheels in alloy rather than plastic, which will have totally different tires of lower profile and thus feel, then they needed to use the V6 to V6 to do a comparison test. I just wonder what they said when the customer inquired about a stick shift, and Saturn said, we have none. This so called increase in sales, was pretty small, and must have averaged some 16 to 20 more cars per state being sold to retail customers. While this was good, it differs from great. Sort of like Honda or Toyota sales the next few minutes (exaggeration included). L  Yes - yes indeed. The \\'98 Accord / \\'07 Sonata, is nice and clean. The lines do their thing and the parts do not appear as being just stuck on for effect. It all worked well in that design. I am pleased with my \\'07 looks wise, but the \\'98 was better in a way. Do like the rear redo on the \\'07, as it looks good. And I agree, based on looks, a Fusion (razor blades and all ) or a Milan looks about the best in within class.L  At least you\\'re being honest by seeing 1998 Accord in 2005 Sonata. :shades: I wasn\\'t talking about tape measurements, but the shape which is undeniably similar. And you might not have noticed, Accord Coupe doesn\\'t have the same headlamps as the sedan.Or, are you disagreeing with those who have been suggesting that Accord looks like Sonata? And if you\\'re all in agreement, then Caliber and Sonata are look-alike too!It usually takes 2-years for Hyundai to get an inspiration. It happened in 1996 (1994 Accord\\'s tail), they \"missed\" 1998 Accord in 2000 but went after Jaguar (S-Type). They managed to get back on track with Accordness (front 1998 Accord and rear 2003 Accord). Now the question is, what car do they have on the drawing board for next Sonata. Perhaps we will see a bit of Honda in 2010 Sonata... Civic has been covered with Hyundai I30 revealed recently.PS. The Japanese vehicle pictured above is not Accord, but \"Stream\". Speaking of which, you can see its rear end in Hyundai I30. :P  maybe the same reason no other manufacturer does this...from a sales perspective, your customer loses their focus on what you\\'re trying to sell them. the dealership/ car brand might be presenting a question the buyer was not asking or would not have asked if the competitors cars weren\\'t there thus presenting another hurdle to overcome.  A car called Stream? Now that should have flowing lines. :blush: now i must pay for punnitive damage, Loren  How about Latitude?Rumors are that Stream will be brought here (and another, that it will be called Latitude).  GM\\'s marketing department can\\'t be that clueless. They didn\\'t think of it earlier? In fact, they announced intentions of same approach as Aura WHILE the program was under way.The fundamental idea was no different than crappy ads from a lot of automakers that compare vehicles from other automakers. In this case, they were confident enough that customers will invariably pick their product. Apparently, it didn\\'t work as well as expected. Or they saw reduced hope with redesign of Accord (it seems to me, redesign of Camry didn\\'t hurt much, or they miscalculated that as well).  How many good reforms get pulled before their true measure can be judged? It happens in business and government all the time. Perhaps their surveys found that it wasn\\'t as effective as they\\'d hoped, perhaps they did not train their salespeople to use this tool effectively... whatever. For whatever reason, they pulled the program. Why they did it is just speculation and in the end it doesn\\'t really matter to those who plan on doing their research before plopping down 20k on something (which I would hope would be all buyers, but coming from a sales background, I\\'d bet a small percentage of people do what I\\'d consider adequate research).  The \"not too sharp comment\" is really not needed. She was most likely looking at an Accord EX not an SE V6. Content wise the Accord EX is more comparable to the Aura XE when you look at the what is standard. An SE is more barebones (pretty much an LX wheel alloys), trust me I have one. Your also comparing an end of life, highly discounted Accord when your comparing prices. Shame on you. Saturn does not discount MSRP unless there is a rebate. If you really want to do a comparison try an 07 22K XR (with incentives) which I\\'m close to purchasing. It smokes the Accord in every category that counts IMO. The XR has DSC, heated seats, 6speed instead of a 5, climate control, 6 CD changer, over 250hp and 250 lbs of torque. The Accord has a measly 211 lbs of torque (real power). Things I easily noticed on my test drive of the XR is how much quieter it was. It was exponentially quieter. Plus the Accord doesn\\'t have a smooth ride. The Aura has great dampening even with 18 inch wheels. Honestly ever since I bought my Accord I\\'ve hated it. It\\'s loud, uncomfortable and just a boring drive. Your talking about resale and honestly I don\\'t see it either. Retail for my 05 SE was 20K. Trade in value was under 14K at several local dealers. Honda incentives have hurt resale just like everyone else. If you like your car that\\'s great but don\\'t try to manipulate the situation and state how much better your SE is since it has an H on the hood. Have you even test driven an Aura? You\\'d probably trade your car in if you did. I advise not doing it.  I think there is a resemblance between the front of the 1998 Accord and the current Sonata. I also think that resemblance is coincidental. The grille and headlamps on the 1998 Accord are very generic, and there\\'s similar shapes on many other cars.We already know what car the next Sonata (2009 MY refresh) has in its sights: the Hyundai Genesis.If you believe that Hyundai intentionally copied the 1998 Accord for its Sonata, then you must also believe that Honda copied old Saturn sedans for the rear end of the 2008 Accord, with a touch of Sonata in the taillamps. Also you must believe that Honda copied the roofline of the Kia Optima on the 2008 Accord--they are dead ringers for each other.Of course, both of those ideas are ridiculous. As is the notion that Hyundai intentionally mimicked an old Accord for their styling inspiration for the Sonata.  ... I like our 2007 SEL AWD Fusion is that its styling -- front, side, back -- doesn\\'t mimic any other car. It is very distinctive and quite pleasing (to us anyway). I\\'ve seen renderings of the 2009 Fusion and still like the 2006-08 version better.That\\'s a good thing because we plan on having the \\'07 for quite a few years even though it is paid for.  They did well indeed, with that design. Also like the Milan. L  Latitude?Well some may like that name, to a degree. Of course the Compass has no relationship to the Latitude. Ya know, Optima is kinda cool. Do believe RadioShack uses Optima too. Ah names, where do they all come from. What is a Camry, I wonder?L  Well, they could learn how to blow up the tires really hard, so the ride seems poorer on a brand X car. L  Well, they could learn how to blow up the tires really hard, so the ride seems poorer on a brand X car. LI don\\'t know this to be a fact but I\\'ve been told that some dealers deliberately under-inflate tires to make a car seem like it has a smoother ride.  2007 SEL AWD Fusion is that its styling -- front, side, back -- doesn\\'t mimic any other car.Although not a sedan...Compare this  to thisAnd, this to this.   You shouldn\\'t have started this silly argument \"Car A copied Car B\" and I shouldn\\'t have replied. :P  First of all, she may be sharp as a tack. I said, sharp on the car buying deal. Nothing personal, so sorry about having it sound that way. I absolutely had driven both cars before buying. I prefer the steering feel and the double wishbone suspension to the Aura. The Aura paddle shifting 6 speed is very nice, and is perhaps better in a way than the Accord. I find the 5 speed in the Accord to be smooth, and the D3 selection for performance on tight roads works fine. So it is about the same, with perhaps a cut above for XR. The engine is very powerful in both cars, with a zero to sixty which is very close. Yes, in a drag race, I could lose. HP is real power, otherwise race cars would lose to diesel trucks. As for quiet, I did notice tire noise in both cars. Could be lower. If you hate how your Honda Accord drives, you would also hate the Aura, as they are similar, with a bit more natural balance to the Accord, and less top heavy feel around corner. And a double wishbone will handle the irregular bumps on turns better than any other setup I can think of. Those 18\" wheels will cost you more come tire replacement time. And you just have more unsprung weight. No advantage there. You mentioned a Honda being better because it has an H on the hood. Nah, that is not the case. You look at the product, and add up the positive and negatives for each and every car. Then you weigh in the pricing and such. Sure a reputation helps.Really helps come resale time. There are some things which Aura needs to improve on, like I pointed out before. And I really hate those foot operated emergency brakes. All in all, the XR is entertaining, and IF they offered a better price, as in cost of car AND my trade-in, I would be driving one today. They did not. What is wrong with getting a good deal on a last of design of a model? And it looks better. I don\\'t care for the new one. That said, the Aura is going to come out in a Chevy flavor with a nicer looking interior, called the New Malibu. It\\'s a moving target. As for an SE being bare bones, it is not. It has every useful feature I could imagine, though lack the iPod input on the stereo, which could be an issue for some. I wonder about that oversight. But the SE V6 has stability control, 6 CD changer, alloy 17\" wheels with Michelin tires, which I think are a bit overrate for grip, but seem to wear well.The remote key allows all window roll down from outside. The dash instruments seem nicer on the Accord. I would NOT advise getting the EX Accord, as the moon roof takes away 2\"+ of headroom, and is a useless thing anyway. The cost in and resale, is not the value play like the SE V6. The SE is the sweet spot. As for manipulating a situation, I am not sure what ya mean. I was there, got the pricing first at Saturn, then at Honda, and took the Honda. Got the deal and went for it. My best guess is that the Aura could be doomed, once the New Malibu is out, but it will still be a very nice car. If you can get the new, even higher rebate on the XR and do not have a trade-in to do, and like the XR, then go for it. Now, I believe you said she bought the XE, which is the base model with 4sp. and 3.5 OHV engine. So how is that a good deal for the same money???L  You may be right. But Hyundai/Kia have a pretty good history on their side. Here is one of the most blatant ones... you say pure coincidence?And this might be equally coincidental as well...If you believe that Hyundai intentionally copied the 1998 Accord for its Sonata, then you must also believe that Honda copied old Saturn sedans for the rear end of the 2008 AccordI\\'ve heard something along the lines, and do see some similarities, not as blatant thought. I asked another guy to describe the similarities, and it sounds like he had just described Mercedes E-class\\' rear, another car that looks like Saturn L200/L300 but not in a \"blatant\" way.Of course, nothing as blatant as this but some Kia/Hyundai products remind me of a step that direction. Want more?  Well, they could learn how to blow up the tires really hard, so the ride seems poorer on a brand X car. LI don\\'t know this to be a fact but I\\'ve been told that some dealers deliberately under-inflate tires to make a car seem like it has a smoother ride.  I don\\'t know this to be a fact but I\\'ve been told that some dealers deliberately under-inflate tires to make a car seem like it has a smoother ride.Whats funny is that makes the car handle like dookie and I find it totally undesirable. I think they get a car in, do a half-azz job of prepping it, and then let it sit on the lot for 2 months without checking it.When I was working at bicycle shops, before bikes went out on test rides, they got their tires checked and their suspensions checked (both use air pressure).  Although not a sedan...Compare this to thisAnd, this to this.The headlights sure do look similar but not the front of the Prelude. I don\\'t see much resemblance in the tail lights though. The clear plastic and plastic chrome on the Fusion tail light, but not the shape, reminds me of a Nissan Altima.  Honestly, I don\\'t know how you could prefer the Accord suspension tuning over the Aura. The Aura has a multi-link setup in the rear which is more advanced and has much better dampening. When you hit bumps in an Accord you can feel them as opposed to the XR which is like a blip. You were the one comparing number of gears. The 5 speed is smooth but so is the GM 4 speed, I was just stating that the XR has 6. Also the steering feel in the Accord is much lighter and not as firm and direct as the hydrolic setup in the Aura. I loved the XR I test drove and almost traded up on the spot if it wasn\\'t for the weak resale value of my Accord. Like I said resale is not that great for the Accord as you make it out to be. Nothing wrong with getting a good deal. I do this myself but your comparison regarding pricing against a heavily discounted, end of life model vs. a newer car is not exactly fair. I appreciate my SE as it has most everything I need except it\\'s not much fun to drive.Back to the OP. I believe she was comparing an EX 4 cylinder to the XE. She thought that was a better deal. You threw in an SE V6 which is a better deal in your opinion. At the end of the day as long as you feel like you got a great deal, be happy with your choice. Seems like she did, you did and I\\'m going to do.  I loved the XR I test drove and almost traded up on the spot if it wasn\\'t for the weak resale value of my Accord. Like I said resale is not that great for the Accord as you make it out to be. Hold it, did you try TRADING the Accord, or actually post it for sale and got low-ball offers? If you got one trade offer at a one dealership, don\\'t be so put-off with your Accord\\'s resale. Its likely higher than you were offered.  Imitation is a sincere form of flattery.  The front end of the 1998 Accord was an evolutionary design from the 1996 Accord.  I don\\'t know how you could prefer the Accord suspension tuning over the Aura. The Aura has a multi-link setup in the rear which is more advanced and has much better dampening.Accord balances ride and handling far better than Aura does. And I doubt you know much about advancements in rear suspension set up. Accord\\'s is a piece of art for its class. The 5-link (Watt-link) double wishbone is one of the reasons the car can handle well without penalizing ride quality, and when pushed around a corner, it provides for a passive steering.And for 2008, Honda has tweaked it a little, so how this version performs, remains to be seen. But Aura\\'s rear suspension more advanced? Thats the first time I\\'m hearing it (didn\\'t feel it).So I decided to see how Aura stacked up in professional comparisons. Looked like C&D placed it fourth with top place going to the \"old\" Accord. This remark stood out.\"As we said, almost right, until the sponges in GM&#146;s Cheapness Department got to the project. Although styled well, the interior is executed with hard plastic, glaring panel gaps, ragged mold lines, and the scrape-scraping of a gear selector that slides through its range like a screwdriver through sand. Have GM&#146;s cheapness freaks ever sat in an Accord?\"Instead of making my own statement (which can be easily \"dismissed\" for being a Hondamentalist), let me quote R&T on suspension:\"The Aura&#146;s ride quality is very refined and comfortable, but the smooth, softly-sprung suspension that serves it so well out on the highway comes with a price....\"Oh well, they should have elaborated on that one.  Unfortunately, I can\\'t take the credit for starting Car A looks like Car B argument. You will have to look again, if you care.   Oh good heavens, if your steering is lighter on your Accord than the Aura, something is wrong. You may have too much air in the tires - who knows. As for heavily discounted pricing, the price discounts was about the same between the Aura and Accord. It was the lack of a good trade-in value. So, I guess you could say it was more heavily discounted. There is the problem. The Saturn Aura was overpriced, if they had intended not to discount them. Now going with the i4 vs. the old huff and puff OHV engine, I guess you could say you gain some HP. But if you want real HP, then get the top V6, and for gas savings the i4. It is a very smooth i4 engine in the Accord. An EX Accord i4 is not a big value play, but is more for those wanting the extra fluff, such as the moon roof and such. Of course it is not going to be as inexpensive as a basic XE. You can get the VP in the i4 if you wish to save money in the i4 series. You can also get a stick shift, which for an i4 engine, is a good choice. Yes, hydraulic steering is a good thing compared to the electric steering assist, Saturn got wrong when first introduced. Others, like the Mazda3 have a goodness to their electric assist steering. I have driven the G6 with electric steering assist and it was not all that much to my liking. As for smoothness of the 4 speed transmission, I guess it was OK. The 4 sp. is really good with the old Northstar V8 engines, and FWD. As you get into a V6 with the OHV engine, which prefers the lower revs, it is still OK I guess. Normally one expects a 5 or now the 6 sp. with a V6 or i4. I did test the XE before XR, and the kick off the line is OK, and passing is OK, but nothing like the XR, which really is a kick in the pants. From 60+ when punched, it is looking for more speed and making nice sounds. Anyway, to each his or her own, Aura and Accord both have good points to them. I wish someone in engineering would have the good thought of placing the emergency brake back into its rightful place however. It is a hand brake to the right of a driver, thank you. Glad she likes her new car. What is right for her, is the right car. We just differ on which numbers are better and how we view cars, I guess.Guess you can sell your Accord and get an Aura. I personally would get the New Malibu, or if I had some extra cash, test the SAAB, before buying an Aura at the current time. The New Malibu will start at $20K and run up to e $27K, but discounts of $1.5K to $4K will soon follow, no doubt. The SAAB clearance prices are usually really hot! That is like the super Epsilon of the bunch. See an Aura is but a brother or is that sister to a rather large and growing family of cars off the same platform. New cars to come in a one or is that couple a years, I guess, from Australia in RWD. For the first time, in a long time, Pontiac may be hot again -- well maybe. Loren  Unfortunately, I can\\'t take the credit for starting Car A looks like Car B argument.Surely you didn\\'t mean \"argument\" literally. It\\'s more like a discussion. Speaking of discussions, does anyone else on this board own a Fusion besides Allen Kirby and yours truly?  \"All in all, the XR is entertaining, and IF they offered a better price, as in cost of car AND my trade-in, I would be driving one today. They did not. \"better price? You werent going to get an Aura, period. You have been pointing out the flaws of the Aura and how its inferior to the Accord for months now. The Aura currently has a $1500 rebate that makes its price more than competitive and considerably lower than comparable 2007 or 2008 accord.As for 18\" wheels, they do have a benefit. They make the car look better. This is why so many cars under $30k offer them these days. The SE is indeed bare bones. No power seat? No MP3 jack? Sorry but ESP and a V6 do not mean a car is loaded.  Okay, 1487, you are just being ridiculous now.For a long time you were complaining about many the so-called \"import fanboys\" did not give a fair shot to the domestic products. Now we have a guy who may not be an \"import fanboy\" who compared the Aura and Accord back to back and ended up choosing the Accord. Instead of praising the guy for giving an equal shot to the Aura you outrageously accused him for never going to get an Aura. If he decided to get an Aura and never tested anything else wouldn\\'t that make him a \"domestic fanboy\"? Please explain to me, are you here to preach \"may the best product wins\" or trying to convert people to become \"domestic fanboys\"?Enough is enough. Unless if you are on GM payroll of course...  Kia admitted using Mercedes as its inspiration for the Amanti. They\\'ve even poked fun at the resemblance in their ads. It\\'s very clear to me at least that Honda used BMW to some extent as an inspiration for the 2008 Accord (because they would never mimic a Kia, would they). Is that a bad thing? Hyundai was very open about Audi being the main influence for the Sonata\\'s exterior.Do you know how many cars have horizontal taillamp bands ala the 2003-7 Accord and 2006+ Sonata? Lots. In fact, the car that most resembles the Accord\\'s taillamps is a Buick from the \\'90s (I think it was the Skylark). The shape is almost exactly the same. Whereas the shape of the lamps on the Accord and Sonata is much different. Does that mean Honda copied the Buick, and pretty blatantly at that? I doubt it.Anyway, does the fact that Car A\\'s grille or taillamps looks like those of Car B pass the \"So what?\" test, other than it being an interesting point about a car? Or does it demonstrate that automakers are running out of unique ways to bend sheetmetal and mold plastic, and when they do something unique (see: Aztec or Matador) it doesn\\'t work out that well?  Or does it demonstrate that automakers are running out of unique ways to bend sheetmetal and mold plastic, and when they do something unique ...I still say that the 2006-08 Fusions look unique, unlike the lookalike Asian products. That, of course, doesn\\'t mean that everybody likes it just because it\\'s different. Indeed, sales have been good but definitely not outstanding.I just know that looks-wise I am more satisfied with the Fusion than I would be with an Accord, Camry, Altima, Legacy, Aura, Sonata et al.  Function over Form is how I see it. If it works better, screw the looks. These cars are redesigned every 5 years at the most, so not much time is spent designing them. Looks are somewhat important to me if we\\'re talking about sports cars, but a family sedan, not so much.  I came onto this board hoping to read intelligent discussion comparing cars like the Aura and 2008 Accord. I happen to have chosen the Aura XR, mostly because of the rebates, but I certainly wouldn\\'t laugh at anyone who buys a 2008 Accord. Unfortunately, instead of interesting discussion comparing the two cars, the board is filled with childish, personal comments between people who are obviously biased for their own cars. Oh, well. Too bad...  I would like the reply to that:1) You are wrong.2) You are wrong again.3) You are wrong a third time, but maintain a certain consistency, no doubt.4) You win the prize, as you are wrong again.Glad to have been of service, before someone mistake\\'s these wild assumptions as anything close to fact.Loren  In the Ford line, I kinda liked the Milan more, though perhaps that has to do with the tail lights. The chromed front on the Fusion is pretty cool. Both are sharp. Has a little edginess to it, like the old CTS, which was pretty cool, but with a softer roundness to the middle. If they are least had a single Legacy Sedan on the lot, I would have tried out one when looking for cars. At the time, there were zero, so I not only did not try the car out, I figured people are not buying that model at all. Guess Subaru is all about the other models??? I saw one or two over the years in the showroom and they looked pretty smooth. They 1000% for a Subaru when compared to some of their previous disasters for stylin\\'. Now I wouldn\\'t mind owning that sports car they had some years ago, but alas the name escapes me know.L  After all the years though, the Accord and CTS, IMHO do not look better. They just look puffier. And I thought I would like the Altima in a revised look, but now I am thinking enough already with the over-sized lamps and overall, it just in need of something really, shall we say New.And yes, sports cars should have the looks, though in some cases, I can think of a clear winner over a newer better looking sports car too. And you can add to this, the oh my God, what is that, comments when a Z3 became a Z4. In this case, yeah a beauty wins, as in Z3, though a Z4 is nice and roomy inside. L  Aura rebates. What is the current XR rebate? At the time I was looking there was two rebates. The second one was only for those which new of such a rebate, I guess. I brought it up to the attention of the salesman and said it was listed on the Edmund\\'s site at the time for California. Well they said they can do that, but it normally is something emailed or whatever. What the heck is that? Still believe they should stock at least a couple base XR\\'s on all those sale lots, as it really is a good deal without needing the bump up add-ons. Sure, there is a mark for loaded to more loaded to loaded to the sky is the limit, but an XR already is pretty good for having what I need, and I am thinking what most people need in a car, to possibly overkill. Heck, maybe they could build but two models, the XR and one called the XR+ which has the leather and navagation, for those in need. Rpice the XR at $21,995 and the XR+ at $24,995 Just a thought. L  You are exactly correct in your observation, and it exists on most of the forums here on Edmunds.com. Instead of objective analysis, it\\'s mostly \"my car is better than yours.\" Freud was right . . .Some folks are downright fanatical about the brand of car they own, and wouldn\\'t own another brand. The problem is most have never actually spent some serious seat time in the other cars they bash, therefore their comments are irrelevant.  I bought a 2007 XR and received 2 rebates, a $1500 rebate and $1000 \\'conquest cash\\' since I traded in a non-GM vehicle, for a total of $2500 off. I bought the car in August and do not believe the conquest cash is available any longer, at least on the XR. I also don\\'t think the 2008 Aura\\'s have any rebates currentlyMy original plan was to wait for the arrival of the 2008 Accords and compare the two cars, but I simply could not pass up this offer. A similarly equipped 08 Accord would have been about 4 grand more. My budget was tight and I liked the Saturn, so I decided just to go with it.  Excellent deal ! I was offered $1,500, then later on, as in a few months, I heard of $1,750. Now $2,500 off is really getting it down there. As for the 2008 Accord, I personally am disappointed in the looks of the new one, inside and out. Do believe the seats are a tab bit better. I prefer the \\'07.Did your dealer have any side sticker for add-ons of pin stripes or window etching, or the like? I take it the trade-in price went well. That was the point where I lost them.L  If the Aura Comparison sales tactic worked wonders as you claim, then they would continue to do it indefinitely.....Why stop?  Oh, and for the record, Saturn did NOT offer any \"deep discounting\" or any \"big time rebates\". And IMO, after driving her new Aura a few times, they don\\'t need to. Fantastic!!! But in a visit to Saturn\\'s website, they do indeed have rebates on the Aura across the board nation wide I believe. Not only that, but last I checked, the Accord and Camry were still outselling the \"no need to discount\" Aura.....   the salesperson at the Saturn dealer said that a fair amount of people did test-drive all three models, and at least 90% of them picked the Aura over the Camry and Accord. Not only owners of current Saturns, but also Honda, Toyota, and Nissan owners as well. Wow, the SATURN salesperson said that? I\\'m amazed, astounded, and shocked and awed...... I think every salesperson at the Honda dealership would agree that the Accord is a better car in every way than the Aura.....   Didn\\'t think I\\'d get so many reactions here. You know that C&D comparo was using an XE not an XR. As for the cheapness, I do agree that there are some cheap bits here and there on the Aura. 2008 Aura solved some of those issues already. And honestly I think my Accord has the same amount of cheap plastics. It\\'s just Honda is better at masking those then the competition although everyone is catching up. A pretty good comparo written by Autoweek shows that the XR is very competitive. http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070126/FREE/70118010/1528/F- REE As for my trade in. I\\'ve been to three dealers all of which are quoting me similar pricing which is kind of depressing since I really want to pull the trigger. Like others have mentioned there\\'s 1500 rebate and a 1000 conquest rebate for 07\\'s. I\\'m actually considering the new Malibu if things don\\'t work out on an 07 Aura. The only thing I don\\'t really like is the front end styling. That grill is huge! One of my favorite things about the Aura is the exterior. The Malibu will be priced better though. An LT2 is, if I remember correctly starting at about 22500. That\\'s without the V6 package. Package pricing hasn\\'t been release yet but I\\'ll assume about 1000-1500 dollars. Plus the LT2 comes with standard suede seats and adjustable pedals. At least that\\'s what I\\'ve read so far about that trim level.  Well, wouldn\\'t the Aura XR \\'07 be the deal then at $21,500? Not to say that the 2008 Aura and Malibu won\\'t both be discounted upon release. But perhaps those rebates are buy $1,000 off. Of course a $1,000 + another $1,000 off by the dealer on a New Malibu \\'08 could be a good deal in that it is one year newer, if you sell a car every say three years. Just a thought. - Loren  Looked over that article. Interesting how the Aura lost to Camry in the slalom. Seems like the long wheel based cars don\\'t fare as well. Or is that the wheel base to width ratio? Anyway, it happens with sports cars losing to little, yet wide cars, like say a Mini -- oh doh! - that\\'s a sports car. Anyway, it happens. The car wins the lateral G testing against the Camry, which evidently doesn\\'t have a way to totally take stability off, if I got that right. The Chrysler 300 was limited that way in testing. Oh well, guess most family cars never make it to the race track. :shades: L  You sure have a poor memory.Would this refresh your memory?Does that mean Sonata\\'s front end will no longer look like 1998 Accord? :confuse:  We are here to compare the features and attributes of the CARS!!!We\\'re not here to snipe at each other and that just has to stop. Who copied whom first does not matter. What you think someone elses biases are does not matter. It\\'s the specifics of the vehicles themselves contrasted with each other that we should be focusing on. This continuing oneupmanship is unnecessary and certainly not conducive to a productive conversation.We have GOT to stick to the cars and drop all this personal stuff. :mad:  Fantastic!!! But in a visit to Saturn\\'s website, they do indeed have rebates on the Aura across the board nation wide I believe.Wrong again!I checked out the site, and noticed only financing offers for the \\'08 Aura. And 5.9% is for 3 years is pretty pathetic IMO, since one can easily do better at a credit union. No cash-back incentives posted anywhere. As for the \\'07, well duh! Everyone is offering incentives to unload the \\'07 models this time of year, including Honda. When she purchased the car in JULY, locally, there were no such incentives or cash-back deals, and the financing rates weren\\'t very stellar either.Face it, there are other excellent cars in the midsize class besides the Accord.BTW, I\\'m taking a break from this discussion, since all I seem to read lately are comments made from certain members holding their car on a pedestal while belittling others for their decisions to buy something else, all the while throwing out assumptions and \"facts\" that just don\\'t hold true anymore.  I\\'d like to see people list 5 top features or characteristics of their chosen, favorite, owned, whatever car that they\\'d like me to know about. Pat asked posters to do that in some discussion in the past and it was interesting. It helps potential shoppers like myself know what\\'s good about that car. I have a potential new or used car in the future in months to give a new driver in the family access to a car. Both cars currently are full-sized. A mid-sized car is my most likely purchase, new or used.  Why don\\'t you stick around and help us get back on the right track?   Yes, listing the top features of your car (or someone else\\'s) that you like is a great way to get information out here that can actually be useful to someone making a shopping decision.It\\'s also okay to list a few things about your car that you\\'d like to change.  It\\'s also okay to list a few things about your car that you\\'d like to changeI have a 2006.5 KIA Optima.The trip computer has no MPG so I would REALLY like to have that. :blush:  It\\'s also okay to list a few things about your car that you\\'d like to change.Here it goes... that\\'s tough because I really like my car a lot!2006 Honda Accord EX 4-cyl (cloth)I have a power-height controlled seat; why not spend the extra $2 Honda and make it FULL power? Well, they did for 2008 at least.Exterior styling was a weak point in this car; the rear end is nice with the LEDs but the front is kind of non-descript. Stability Control across the lineup would\\'ve been nice too, like Hyundai did. Honda has fixed my gripes for the past model, while introducing some new ones (I sat in an LX-P and an EX 4-cyl Accord Sunday - interior quality is no longer head of the class IMO - major disappointment as this was a HUGE plus of getting the Accord over competitors). Now I won\\'t have a clue where to start next time around!  Some people discuss cars, you chose to discuss people. If you care for automotive discussion, talk cars!  We did this not too long ago, but if it helps prospective buyers then great:Kia Optima5 likes:* Good blend of ride quality and handling* Roomy, high-quality interior but reasonable exterior size* Good fuel economy (I4, 5MT or 5AT) for the class* Warranty* Price/valueNeeds improvement:* Better availability of ABS/ESC package (e.g., can\\'t get it on the base trim without an \"appearance\" package, and even then it\\'s very rare--only 3 LX models with the package in my entire region when I checked a few weeks ago).* More power for the V6 (this is not an issue for me as I prefer the I4, but the V6 is outclassed by just about every other car in this segment).  A pretty good comparo written by Autoweek shows that the XR is very competitive.http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070126/FREE/70118010/1528/F- - REE I found that article to be very enlightening. Unfortunately, we are no longer in the market for a new car, having purchased a 2007 3.0-liter V6 SEL AWD Ford Fusion 9 1/2 months ago on Dec. 4, 2006. Still, it\\'s good to be informed about what\\'s available and how the different models compare to one another.People who are in the market for a new car certainly have a lot of good mid-size sedans to choose from these days. I don\\'t believe Accord and Camry dominate the segment the way they used to. Our Fusion is a very good example of an alternative, especially the SEL variation.  Ten years ago, I decided to explore the new car territory. I had owned three Toyotas before that, starting with 1982 Celica-Supra, 1988 Corolla GT-S coupe and finally a 1992 Camry. With plenty of drive time behind Taurus and Camry, the two midsizers were out.I test drove Maxima, Altima (wasn&#146;t a part of the plan), Accord, Intrigue and Passat. Grand Prix was a part of the plan, but the combination of sticker and interior quality was a huge turn off. I got in, and got out. 1998 Passat was on top with Accord closely behind. Wanted to take a chance with the VW, but sanity prevailed and went with my first Honda. Ten years later, here are the strengthsReliability: 181K miles, and ten years don&#146;t show anywhere but on the steering wheel (leather wrapped, so the spots where I hold the wheel have some wear, as do buttons on the steering wheel). Everything else is virtually impeccable. Everything works just like it did ten years ago, with the same directness and crispness. There is been just ONE out of normal wear and tear repair (a cracked radiator hose) at about 150K miles. Besides that, it has been all about replacing 2-3 headlamp bulbs (my lights are always on), one tail lamp bulb, a few sets of tires, several batteries, and other normal pieces. It is still a car that I don&#146;t mind taking on road trips.Value: IIRC, the car (EX-L/auto) was listed at $23,145. I paid $21.2K plus TTL. The car was rated 23/30 mpg. I average 26 mpg regularly in half and half mixed driving (27+ mpg on last two tanks). Even now, the car gets 32 mpg at 75 mph. I&#146;ve been disappointed by a lot of cars that are rated better now, but they have failed to beat this Accord under my lead foot.At 100K mile mark, I considered replacing it with something new but decided against it since it still felt new. At 150K mile mark, the thought came back, and a few thousands miles later, I found it a stable-mate, a 2006 TL. The two cars share the garage, and duties (about a thousand miles each per month). If 7.5 years without having to make a payment, only scheduled maintenance and a minor repair is all that it took, I can&#146;t see anything but a huge value in this car. Superb daily gas mileage is a plus.This is also a car that has been pushed to its payload limits on occasions. Most of the landscaping needs were handled in it, without having to rent a pickup.And I was recently offered $3.5K for it. But this car is a part time limo for my dog.Drive train:This car feels stronger than the old 150 HP suggest (under new standard, it would probably be rated in low 140s). Ten years ago, I didn&#146;t think 200 HP V6 was needed. And I was right. This car is impressive on two-lane highway overtaking situations at high speed too. Even with V6, a lot of midsized cars (the old Taurus and Sonata come to mind) required backing off to have enough room to get up to speed (>70 mph), move over to the left lane and complete the pass. With the Accord, the car seems to pull relentlessly beyond 80 mph. CR got that right. When I saw their numbers (40-80 mph acceleration), the 150 HP Accord took the same time as 192 HP Camry V6 (in mid-low 5 second range).Handling and Performance:It is no sports sedan, but it rides like on rails at 80 mph. Cross winds don&#146;t play their trick on the chassis at high speeds. Curves are always welcome. The steering gets better with speed, still sharp and responsive. Going over bumps, the chassis still settles with the same aplomb, one bounce and that&#146;s it. It is an easy car to drive fast. It feels sure footed, and smaller than it is.The car will rotate under throttle while turning (the fantastic 5-link double wishbone rear suspension at work). It tracks very-very well. In one of the customer reviews that I just read, the 2008 Accord seems to have this quality intact, and better than 2003-2007 model.And brake pads have lasted! The original pads took 90K miles of abuse in the front, and 132K miles in the rear. Since then, the replacement front pads have gone another 91K miles, and rear pads have 49K miles on them.Styling:It has great interior ergonomics with, one of the most intelligently designed dash controls. It seems every button was given a thought regarding its function and placement. They are laid out in perfect symmetry, and finished off with a minor and easily overlooked detail like a notch on the button that sits in the middle of everything (the notch is similar to the notch on &#147;F&#148; and &#147;J&#148; keys on a PC keyboard, useful to determine position of the finger without having to look).Buttons are mostly dedicated. Some people are overwhelmed by more buttons but doing so helps the driver as they require no more than a quick glance. The 2008 Accord takes a similar approach.While many (at the time, and right here at Edmunds) associated tail lamp design with Buicks (someone just did that with Accord a few posts above, backy, is that you?), I saw a revival of Prelude&#146;s tail lamp from late 1980s. Prelude&#146;s was continuous (with red and white to begin with, then amber was added) wrapping the entire tail section. In Accord, the license plate broke the continuity. I would have liked to see that design element in 2008. But then, people would have screamed &#147;Honda copied Infiniti, BMW, Avalon\\x85&#148;.While I loved the rear, the side also brought a new styling theme in a subtle but crisp line running across the side from front fender, over the door handles to the tail lamp. This has lately become a more common feature in several cars. 2003 Accord got the same but at an angle. Also loved the design of the headlamp at the time with full width amber parking lamp casing below the low/high beam lamp. Shortly after, Audi TT got similar treatment. Now, that seems to be a defining character in new Audi beginning with R8 (all models are supposed to get LEDs in varying shape). Backy, I won&#146;t be surprised that this is next in line at Hyundai. I think they will go back and claim &#147;they copied from Audi&#148;, copying from a car it actually competes with wouldn&#146;t sound right, would it? Having addressed what I liked, and still like about the Accord, and most of the qualities have been passed down (now two) generations, I can still see myself getting the new Accord. There aren&#146;t many cons to it, but I will list anyway.The exterior shape wasn&#146;t ground breaking, and while pleasing for most part, I always thought it lacked a proper grill. But that has long been missing from Accords in American market (not a case with Accords in other markets).Some interior trims were flimsy. I didn&#146;t like the plastic pieces that were to cover the bolts at the back edge of the front seats. Honda could have used better finish to the sides of the center stack (either side of the shifter).Road noise was an issue with original tires (Michelin Energy MXV4). I\\'m glad they were overly expensive when it was time to replace, I considered other brands, and they showed how much difference tires can make.  Honda has fixed my gripes for the past model, while introducing some new ones (I sat in an LX-P and an EX 4-cyl Accord Sunday - interior quality is no longer head of the class IMO - major disappointment as this was a HUGE plus of getting the Accord over competitors). Now I won\\'t have a clue where to start next time around!Shopping for a new car be fun, Grad, especially in today\\'s mid-size segment. It\\'s a very competitive marketplace even though Toyota and Honda will continue to be the No. 1 and No. 2 best sellers.  Oh i LOVE car shopping. I do it all the time and I\\'m nowhere NEAR buying one in the next 3-5 years. Car SHOPPING and car BUYING are two different things though. I always go with family members when they are car shopping strictly because I enjoy it.  That is an exceptional report about a car that has obviously served you well.  Edmund\\'s shows a $500 rebate. If they were offering up to $2,500 before, why settle for $500 though. The 2008 is likely to be the same as the 2007. I assume you are going to keep the car more than three years anyway, if buying a GM vehicle new.As for pricing on Honda Accords, they indeed were discounting very-very early on. I made a deal back in later February. Discounting of the car is not just a recent event. The final year of the design was the reason, along with a sluggish economy. Too many people struggling with house loans, is what they say these days.Yes, there are excellent, very good, and good cars in the same class of mid-sized cars other than Accord. You betcha, there are all so many, and after you test drive and do the research, you can usually get it down to a couple or three which meet your requirements. The current look of Accord, IMHO would scratch it off the list. Even that too busy looking interior, whew. As for Honda or XXX car dealerships not having incentives or offering deals, you do have to drive some times to find a good deal - dealer. Loren  If the Aura Comparison sales tactic worked wonders as you claim, then they would continue to do it indefinitely..... c\\'mon andres3... did you even read what I wrote? I actually gave reasons why the Saturn plan may not work!! At least try to quote me accurately! (this is my second post on this matter, but my first post got deleted by the host b/c I got mad that andres3 was misrepresenting things... so hopefully they will find this post better)As to the Aura, I saw one on my way to work and it\\'s a nice looking car! Muscular yet sleek. It\\'s good to see another solid looking option.  My 03 Accord sedan rear windows do not go all the way down. The position of the rear doors in relation to the rear wheel usually reduces clearance, so either you get a short window (back to front), or the wider window will not go all the way down. Usually you end up with about the same size window opening. I don\\'t know if the Mazda6 windows, which go essentially all the way down, are any shorter than Fusion\\'s or Accord\\'s. Does not seem to be much difference in the size of the fixed triangular bit, which I would think would look bigger if the window were shortened in order to have it go all the way down. In the case of the Sonata, the fixed piece of glass does look a little bigger. I think I\\'d rather have that then to have windows that only go down 2/3 or 3/4 of the way, though.Does the Accord, like the Fusion, leave 4 inches of glass exposed when rolled down. This was something I gave no thought to, not that it would be much of a factor anyway, but I do like that my rear windows go down like they do.  Out of curiosity, why is the rear window going all the way down so important to you? The old days, when say that LeSabre I drove, without the center pillar, did look so sharp with all the windows down, but these days, I do believe the center is alway broken up with the pillar in the center, and thus no hardtop convertible look. Guess roll over accidents did not fare to well in the old days. L  So you have a problem with my experiences. If I\\'m kidding (probably trying to be politically correct, instead of calling me a liar), let us meet sometime. Bring one of those cars I mentioned as not being up to par, and I will have my old Accord on hand. Are you up for the challenge? It would be easier if you happen to be in Dallas area. But I do drive around quite a bit.I don\\'t have a crystal ball like you appear to do predicting that I won\\'t be able to find another so perfect car. What does it say about my 2006 TL? It has got 29K miles on it.And Honda is indeed a company I would love to work for. But, among things you listed as normal pieces, only water pump (replaced with timing belt at 95K miles) fit. Everything else is as it was delivered ten years ago. If you find it unbelievable, it is because it is!  But, among things you listed as normal pieces, only water pump (replaced with timing belt at 95K miles) fit. Everything else is as it was delivered ten years ago. If you find it unbelievable, it is because it is!I\\'m glad your experience has been so positive, its good to know there is one to offset mine.  Great choice on the TL, it was the second one on my very short list when I was car shopping about 1.5 years ago. I am convinced that if a guy likes the Accord, he\\'ll like the TL as well.Seems like both you and me are pretty anal about interiors so I\\'ll share something with you...Go grab the door handles on your TL and try to twist it with a little force applied. You\\'ll find that the door handle was actually made by soft plastic and can be twisted around. It\\'s no big deal but I just don\\'t think it should happen on a $32K+ car.That and the fake wood are probably my only nit picking about the TL. It is a great car with a very reasonable price, could be a whole lot better with the SH-AWD though.  I don\\'t think he was talking about a current Sonata, but instead a late model one, that had the 2.7.Here is an Edmunds take on that engine, from the 2003-2004 Midsize Comparison test.The Hyundai offers a mostly tepid driving experience. Its 2.7-liter V6 is rated for 170 horsepower and 181 pound-feet of torque, and it was about as fast as the Passat in instrumented acceleration testing. Out on public roads, though, the Sonata felt slower, as its engine had little to work with until it had revved to about 3,500 rpm. After that point, the lethargy ceased and the Hyundai offered ample highway passing power. The engine was quiet at cruise, and drivers preferred it to the slightly faster Sebring\\'s due to its greater refinement.Our test vehicle came with a four-speed automatic transmission (your only choice for 2004) with an automanual mode. The transmission shifted smoothly but was slow on the draw with downshifts. This hesitation was particularly noticeable when a quick burst of speed was needed to catch an opening in traffic.In 0-60, it ran 9.1 seconds. The Accord 4-cyl in 2003 (10 more hp, 9 more lb-ft, but 200lbs heavier too - so probably a wash) was discussed in a long-term test from Edmunds.com also. Here\\'s what an editor had to say... Editor in Chief Karl Brauer logged more positive comments: \"The car is fast. Not fast for a four-cylinder but simply fast. I never felt like it was lacking in power, and considering the way I typically drive on my commute down Pacific Coast Highway, that\\'s pretty amazing.\" After passing the break-in period, we subjected the Accord to our standard battery of instrumented testing, where it managed an 8.8-second 0-to-60-mph run.So, I don\\'t think it\\'s that far-fetched to say his 4-cyl Accord could run with the old V6 Sonata. Considering the fact that with VTEC more power could be had more flexibly than the 2.7 V6 from that era.The 2004 Sonata V6 was 170hp/3200lbs, the 1998 Accord 4-cyl was 150hp/2900 lbs (According to ConsumerGuide).Today though, is a different story.  Oh never fear, those are the new rubber door handles, designed with safety in mind Speaking of $32K cars, I just saw an ad for a Mercedes for that amount of money. Wonder how that stacks up against the new CTS, and the little Bimmer, the 3? Will the day come when the problems with reliability no longer be an issue with Mercedes. For a long time now, the SLK, their little roadster, was their most reliable effort. I can see how some may be leery though of a German luxury company offering a car in the $32K range given the dollar - Euro rates, and well let\\'s say current pricing of more common cars, like a Toyota reaching that level. I sounds great to get a Mercedes at this prices. But if it sounds too good to be true then??? As the cost to buy loaded mid-size family cars goes up, do we now have a meeting with the low end of luxury cars? Anyone road tested the new baby Mercedes, the CTS, and BMW3 lately? Hasn\\'t the 3 grown up these days; size wise that is? Are the Japan choices better, in the lowest $30K\\'s ? And the Swedes? Who out there is willing to give Mercedes a go? Or let\\'s go out there a little farther, what about the Azera and other luxury Korean cars. Which would you buy - which are off the list? Loren  That and the fake wood are probably my only nit picking about the TL.Plastic wood (plood) is one of my pet peeves. I dislike it in all cars. I don\\'t even care for real wood as a matter of fact. Our 2007 Ford Fusion has something called piano black trim. Yeah, it\\'s plastic but to my mind\\'s eye it looks a lot more upscale than plood.  I rec\\'d a V6 Sonata rental the other day from Enterprise. The Sonata is very powerful in V6 clothing. I believe articles that report they have had it as low as 6.9. My first V6 Sonata that I drove in 2006 had a pause in the accelerator that was annoying to me. The one I drove the other day was responsive and very quick. The band of acceleration was nearly as good as the 3.5 VQ engines I drove for many years. Anyone who says the Sonata V6 is \\'deficient\\' hasn\\'t driven a Sonata V6 3.3 or an Azera 3.8. Very, very good engines.To date I have spent time behind the wheel of the following rentals: Ford Taurus(classic model), Mitsu Galant and Lancer, Pontiac Grand Prix (3.8), Hyundai Azera, Kia Rondo, Kia Optima, Dodge Caliber, Chrysler Sebring, Ford Escape, Nissan Altima, Chevy Malibu. I have not rented a new Camry or Accord but have driven them privately  0-60 speeds are like those guys which think they are the toughest on the block. Well, sooner or later they meet their match or get beat (beat up). Power in a car, nowadays, is more or less just like other things in rating a car, a matter of preference. Personally, anything faster than 0-60 in 9 seconds is good for a four banger, and 0-60 below 7.5 seconds is fine for a six cylinder. And those under 7 seconds are quick, while those under 5 seconds are really-really fast. Most all the new mid-sized cars are adequate power wise. It is not like the old days of say 12-13 or 14 seconds to 60 times. I now enjoy the six cylinder power in a modern car, but I lived with, and safely drove less powerful cars. I imagine my Corolla was around 10 seconds, or more some times when it failed to kick down to first on the on-ramp, but I managed to make it, or bailed out :surprise: The new four bangers, I take it, should have more go power, like I said at 9 seconds or less to 60 and thus pretty safe. That said, I do like those sub 7 second runs to 60 MPH, and it has helped me out a few times already. So, I don\\'t know how my times would compare to others as what I would say is good for each engine, but that is how I see it. And I don\\'t see too much of a difference when considering a car which say had a 0-60 of 6 seconds vs another which was 7 seconds. Yes, power is a good thing, but really anything sub 7.5 seconds seems to me to be moving along quickly and will be able to pass well, and merge with any traffic on the freeway, except a Ferrari, Porsche or Corvette. drive on - Loren  Is that the high gloss black? Yes - looks good. Any scratch problems to date? L  The more power added to cars, the less important it becomes. Heck, my 2006 Accord 4-cylinder is faster than an Accord V6 from 9 years earlier (same amount of power, more forward gears in the transmission). I drive my 1996 with 130 hp and a 4-speed Auto pretty regularly. When I go for a few days and get back in my 06 with 166 hp and iVtec, I forget how fast it is! I dig deep on the throttle on an on-ramp and **whooosh** off I go! The 130 hp (probably 125 on the new standard) hasn\\'t been a deadly hazard since I know how to plan for things, but the extra 40 hp in my 2006 model is a welcome addition in point-and-squirt merging situations.  Fake or real, I detest wood trim now. It has become a fine way to cover up design/assembly/quality deficiencies that prevail in most cars. That was one bonus I had with choosing silver exterior in the TL. I got an industrial look on the inside with carbon fiber trim to go with nice looking aluminum.  I agree. While 0-60 makes for an interesting read, I prefer the more realistic rolling acceleration times that few magazines care about. There is less &#147;flash&#148; about it after all.  I have the piano black interior on my 2006 Fusion - 2 years now and no scratches.And the rear windows only stick up about 2 inches at the front of the door when down, not 4 inches. It disappears into the door about halfway back. So the rear half of the window is totally down.  I know the carbon fiber in the TL is fake as well. How about the aluminum? Are those real or just aluminum \"finish\"?  Please list these \"other normal items\" that failed.  Is the rear window something of concern to you because you have kids which like to hand an elbow out the window when driving? I am just trying to figure out here as to why it is of any concern for say two inches showing, none showing, or say six inches should be showing.Here is a neat trick with the Accord. You can hit the open twice on the key, and hold it the second time and all the windows go down. Good to cool the car, or toss a hat inside, or whatever. To roll up from outside, you do have to insert key in door and turn twice and hold, but that too is better than going inside to roll all the windows. Now this is progress.... well unless it stops working some day :blush: The Fusion did not get the infusion of the 3.5 V6 due to manufacturing limitations for supply, I take it. Or will they just put a tweaked 3.0 in soon? And yes, the current one gets the job done, but you know all the games they play for comparison testing. If I recall correctly, the 0-60 is plenty good. Any i4 changes to come soon? One of the greatest concerns I had about the car, was more about the state of Ford the company. I hope they survive into the next decade and beyond. The initial quality of the car seems to top the rest.L  Here is a neat trick with the Accord. You can hit the open twice on the key, and hold it the second time and all the windows go down.

Now this is progress.... well unless it stops working some day Yeah the 99.5 Jetta did that, so Honda was about 4 years behind on a feature. Its very similar to now, where almost every car made has an iPod interface and ability to control it through the factory radio, while the \\'07 does not, and I believe the \\'08s just have an Aux in, hardly what I would consider integration.  No-no, I didn\\'t say the window goes down and falls out. No, on the Honda it just goes down. :P Not the same as on the Jetta! L  The carbon fiber trim is fake, but it looks real. I have never understood the point of fake versus real argument anyway. If it looks real, it might actually look better than real. The aluminum is real, and I love the texture.  the 1998 Accord 4-cyl was 150hp/2900 lbs (According to ConsumerGuide). Consumer Guide probably listed the curb weight for DX model. IIRC, my EX-L was listed at about 3150 lb. The EXV6 was close to 3300 lb.  I have done that already. The only one that would fit \"failed\" criteria...- cracked radiator hose (at ~150K miles)The \"not failed\" replacements...- Tires (a few sets)- Battery (I think three times)- Headlamp bulbs (IIRC, three)- Tail lamp bulb (one)- Wiper blades (several)- Timing belt/Water pump (at 95K miles)- Front brake pads (at 90K miles)- Rear brake pads (at 132K miles)- Fluids (Transmission, oil changes...)Current odometer reading: 181K milesThats all I can recall at this time. Happy?    Does the Accord, like the Fusion, leave 4 inches of glass exposed when rolled down.The windows are not rolled down very often, and I\\'ve never measured it, but it\\'s a couple of inches. My car has side, and curtain airbags, and the doors are pretty far from the passenger, so it would be difficult to rest your arm on the door in any case. You wouldn\\'t want to have an arm there if and when the airbags deploy. Part of the reason I got the top-of-the-line Accord in 03, was for all the safety items that were only included on that car. How far the rear window went down, meant nothing to me.  Just curious, does anybody know of a dealer that is receiving the 08 Coupe this week? Cuz I contacted a few places and they all said they\\'ll be arriving in about two weeks. That\\'s like in October!?!? What happened to the rumor of it being released on Sept 20th??  Fake or real wood trim has become a fine way to cover up design/assembly/quality deficiencies that prevail in most cars.How does \"wood trim\" cover up deficiencies and \"carbon fiber trim\" not do the same thing? Or am I misinterpreting your intent to state the \"wood trim\" and \"carbon fiber trim\" are used to cover up deficiencies.  Thats all I can recall at this time. Happy? I was neither happy nor unhappy - it was a simple question because you didn\\'t list all the \"other failed items\" and I was curious what was in the list. Don\\'t be so defensive.  From what I\\'ve seen it appears the plan was to use a tweaked 3.0L for the 2009 Fusion instead of the 3.5L due to supply issues - but that has apparently changed and the 3.5L will debut with the 09 model next year. They\\'ve either diverted engines from other vehicles or ramped up 3.5L production ahead of the original schedule. A new 2.5L I4 is also rumored in addition to the new 2nd generation hybrid.  Never thought about that. Another safety thing to worry about, as my arm is going to be taken off by the air bag, when all I wanted to do was to hand an elbow out? Oh great ! Guess my next new car will be an old used car. Too much going on with these new cars. :confuse: I don\\'t know if I am safer or just going to be banged up more.  Let\\'s see, you must sit up straight, keep hands at 9 and 3 instead of 10 and 2 or what I do quite often across the center of the wheel. And now I am not suppose to hand an elbow out the window. OK, in realistic terms, that normally is around town at 10 to 20 MPH. - Loren the human pinata in a wreck!  I usually drive with my left hand only, and it\\'s resting on my leg, near the bottom of the steering wheel, so my arm can\\'t reach the door sill very easily. Some people have more adjustments to make than others. If your car has side airbags, you should not be hanging your arm out the window. Even resting your arm on the arm rest could be trouble in a crash. Safety comes at a price, in more ways than one. Where do we draw the line on \"Safety\", and are all these safety devices worth the price? I think ABS is important, and all the airbags I can get. But how much does ESC cost? for something that I will most likely never need? I have only used ABS twice in 20 years, and I can\\'t think of one instance where ESC would have been needed.  Did I actually use the word liar? I don\\'t think so. Do I always believe what I read especially a \"voice\" on the internet ...nope. Now that that is settled... How about if I post my own car story which is true (or call me a liar if you choose). I own a 1995 Dodge Stratus that has been in the family since 1998. My daughter bought it from the original owner with 92K miles showing, drove it until Sept. 2003 when she traded it for a new 2003 Elantra. After some thought (and since I needed another \"work\" car) I purchased it from the Hyundai dealer where she traded. It had 132,XXX miles showing at that time. It now has 192,054 miles. I have added new tires and those have about 40+K miles with ~ 1/2 tread left, new front brake pads (they don\\'t last as long as a Honda ) a new timing belt (the second) at 186K miles and replaced the water pump (original) and idler pulleys (also original) at the same time. The AC compressor and components are original, the power steering pump and alternator are also original. I replaced inner and outer tie rod ends and struts and shocks not too long ago and..you guessed it they were original too. Yeah, bulbs have been replaced over its lifetime as well. The engine has not been touched except for plugs and wires (it is a Mitsubishi 2.5 liter V-6). It uses little oil (about 1 qt. over 4500-5000miles). The interior, especially the seat fabric, looks new except for one cigarette \"melt\" on the driver seat. In fact it looks much better than that on our 2006 Civic which has a worn patch on the driver seat AND for which my dealer has a replacement waiting only for me to make an appointment to be installed. The Civic has a little over 10K miles.  It is tight with no rattles and handles great. I run it to to redline through the gears every now and again and it will still cruise at 75 mph for hours and my last tank was 27+ mpg. It passed the fairly rigid Pa. state inspection (including the emissions part) last week with no problems. So, in spite of how poorly many here think of Chrysler products I think it compares favorably to your Honda.  Will I buy another Dodge because of this experience? Nope, Hyundai for me.   Will I buy another Dodge because of this experience? Nope, Hyundai for me.Eh, they have the same engine, whats the difference?  From what I\\'ve seen it appears the plan was to use a tweaked 3.0L for the 2009 Fusion instead of the 3.5L due to supply issues - but that has apparently changed and the 3.5L will debut with the 09 model next year. They\\'ve either diverted engines from other vehicles or ramped up 3.5L production ahead of the original schedule. A new 2.5L I4 is also rumored in addition to the new 2nd generation hybrid. No official figures on that yet but I\\'ve seen 180-200 HP stated for that I4. That\\'s a pretty big range so I\\'m wondering if the Ford version will have the ~180 and the Mazda version will be closer to 200 after they sprinkle the Zoom Zoom dust on it.   I read your Dodge Stratus (192,000 miles) and Honda Civic (10,000 miles) account with great interest. The last two sentences threw me for a loop: Will I buy another Dodge because of this experience? Nope, Hyundai for me.Why a Hyundai, Robert? I am curious.One of the reasons why we bought a 2007 3.0-liter V6 SEL AWD Ford Fusion was because of generally good experiences with a 1997 3.8-liter V6 Ford Thunderbird (83,000 miles) and a 2000 2.0-liter I4 Ford Focus station wagon (92,000 miles).  What do you mean by that? The fact that Chrysler is using an I-4 co-developed by Hyundai and several others? It isn\\'t, strictly speaking, a Hyundai engine, nor the same engine found in Hyundai products. And, as far as I am concerned, Dodge in no way equates Hyundai in the rest of the car either.  Eh, they have the same engine, whats the difference?A Dodge and a Hyundai have the same engine?  No. The four-cylnider Chrysler \"world engines\" do share some common design elements with some Hyundai engines such as the 2.4L I4 on the Sonata, but they are not the same engines.  The Mazda6 also has the feature where windows can be opened by the remote...only the two front ones for some reason.As for \"why is the rear window going all the way down so important...?\", I never said it was...I think I said it was a minor point, but that I prefer them to go down. I had just assumed that the days of windows going down 1/2 or 2/3 were over, hearing that they are not in the case of the Fusion was a surprise. The Accord\\'s sound like they are about like the Mazda6\\'s.There are a lot of other small preferences that I have, some I got in the 6, some I did not. These are not, by themselves, likely to cause me to choose one vehicle over another. Some of these preferences that come to mind are: steering wheel audio controls, \"manual\" mode in an automatic, extender on sun visor, doors that open without having to unlock first, automatic door locks, the \"old\" mazda6 type vents, minimal chrome, no wood or fake wood,...  No official figures on that yet but I\\'ve seen 180-200 HP stated for that I4.I highly doubt the power numbers will be that high. Mazda has announced they made the 2.3L into a 2.5L and it will produce 170hp. That is for Europe. I cannot believe that the U.S. application will be any different. I do not see anything higher then 180, and 180 might be doubtful.  I had just assumed that the days of windows going down 1/2 or 2/3 were over, hearing that they are not in the case of the Fusion was a surprise.As I already explained the Fusion windows go all the way down at the rear of the window and only stick up about 2\" at the front tapering down to flush about halfway. They\\'re barely noticeable and you can still put your arm out on the rear half of the window if necessary. That\\'s about as good as you can get with most designs today.  Its Ron but to answer your question. While we had a relatively good experience with this, a 12 year old Dodge, that I bought partly because I maintained it even when my daughter owned it and therefore didn\\'t expect any suprises there isn\\'t any new Chrysler product that interests me. Couple this with the corporate problems (a new owner etc.) Chrysler is experiencing and I won\\'t consider one.  Why Hyundai? Well, as I said my daughter has one (2003 Elantra)with about 36K miles and no problems, our son has the 2000 Elantra I bought him in Dec. 2003. It had about 63K miles then and has 166K miles now (he adds 100 miles per day in his commute). I know every penny that was spent on this car since we bought it and the list of replacement parts/repairs is as follows:1. new alternator @ 154,XXX miles.2. the original battery ruined by the failure of the alternator..same mileage3. 2 sets of tires over 103K miles.4. several sets of Hyundai brand rotors that for some reason developed \"chatter\" upon braking. These were replaced under warranty but I finally bought Bendix rotors that have been fine since. An anomaly? 5. 1 set plugs and wiring.6. new timing belt @ ~ 80K miles and a new water pump at the same time because it is prudent to do that.7. in Feb of this year a \"flex pipe\" was needed in the exhaust system. It connected the down pipe (at the exhaust manifold) to the rest of the exhaust. Further I personally have owned two Santa Fe SUV\\'s. One a 2002 the other a 2003. Before anyone tries to make something of the early trade for the 2003 there were certain features introduced in \\'03 I \"had to have\". And before someone tries to make something about trading a Hyundai for a Honda (in the fall of 2005) the simple explanation is gas went over $3.00 per gallon for the first time ever and fuel economy while reasonable for an SUV wasn\\'t that great in light of the price. So, the uncertainty of future prices was the reason for that trade. It wasn\\'t that I disliked my Hyundai or that it was troublesome, on the contrary, it like all the others in our family was extremely troubleFREE. I originally wanted a Sonata but chose maximum economy and bought the Civic. Why not a 2006 Elantra? Well, that design was getting a bit \"old\" at 5 model years and I knew a redesign was in the works but didn\\'t want to wait more than a year for that either. In light of the disappointment with the Civic I wish I had gone with the Sonata. I like Hyundai, I tried to like Honda but too many small things turned me off. To be clear it never left us sit, never had major component trouble but I lost track of Honda service bulletins that were issued to correct original flaws. That plus several recalls (three that I know of) were also issued. The latest is: #07V40200 a brake light switch problem...oh, that isn\\'t the latest there also is #07V399000 which is a rear wheel bearing/speed sensor issue that may allow the rear wheel (s) to fall off.  In summary there is no major foul-up for Hyundai ever.. nothing like the Toyota engine sludge issue or Honda transmission problems. Never say never but not to date. You are correct go with the good experience and that was/is Hyundai not Honda..sorry boys. So yeah, Hyundai for me.  I highly doubt the power numbers will be that high. Mazda has announced they made the 2.3L into a 2.5L and it will produce 170hp.Direcet injection will easily raise it to 200. I was wrong about the numbers I read though. The Ford employee who graced us with the prelim numbers for the 2008 Mazda6 stated 190-200 HP for the 2.5L I4 and, after checking the post again, it is a DI engine. Remember, these are prelim numbers, but from a reliable source IMO.  Sorry, just the same head and block. My bad. The Chrysler \"world engine\" has Mercedes\\' variable valve timing, Hyundai uses their own.Eh, a rose by another name...  As I already explained the Fusion windows go all the way down at the rear of the window and only stick up about 2\" at the front tapering down to flush about halfway. Sorry, I must have misread something...I thought that comment was about the Accord. I guess we did not get a detailed rear window report from any Accord owners  . The Sonata was reported to have windows that go all the way down. Urnews had said fusion left 4 inches of rear window :confuse: . What you say about the Fusion sounds exactly like the Mazda6, which makes more sense.  It applies to any additional trim piece (carbon fiber, aluminum, wood). But wood is something that is a bit too common, down to the cheapest economy cars that don\\'t have much else going. And I equally detest the silver/aluminum plastic trims too, in any car.  What\\'s a couple of inches between friends? :blush:  Urnews had said fusion left 4 inches of rear window . What you say about the Fusion sounds exactly like the Mazda6, which makes more sense.I was mistaken, relied on memory. What Allen Kirby described is accurate. By actual measurement, 1.5 inches of the glass is above the sill at the most forward point. It tapers downward and disappears about midway of the sill. I apologize for the faulty information.It still bugs me that it doesn\\'t disappear completely. Not a biggie, to be sure, just a minor annoyance. It looks like a mistake even if it\\'s not.  Sources I found indicate that \"reportedly\" while the basic block was designed by Hyundai, Chrysler and Mitsubishi made \"a large number of modifications and changes to make it more efficient and adapt it to their uses and technologies. Most of the packaging and dressing such as the intake manifold and valve timing equipment appear to have been developed by each partner independently and will be used independently as well.\" Many components are out sourced including rods pistons camshafts and others. Further there are several variants of this including a 1.8 liter a 2.0 liter a 2.4 liter (which has more hp than the Sonata @ 173) and both a 2.4 liter turbo (which has far more @ 300) and a 2.0 liter diesel. I would say that even the basic block as designed by Hyundai has been modified enough by both Chrysler and Mitsu. that it is not the same engine as used in the Sonata. The displacement is the same, true, but the engine has enough differences that..nope..it isn\\'t a \"Hyundai engine\" any more than it is a \"Mitsubishi engine\" or a \"Chrysler engine\" it is a GEMA engine which is a separate company...co-developed for sure. If you want further differences I guess I can research more and come up with some. Further research shows no Hyundai applications for this series of engines.  Another good report, Ron. Much appreciated.In summary there is no major foul-up for Hyundai ever.. nothing like the Toyota engine sludge issue or Honda transmission problems. Never say never but not to date. You are correct go with the good experience and that was/is Hyundai not Honda..sorry boys. So yeah, Hyundai for me.The thing that bothers me so much about the Toyota sludge problem is how the company stonewalled for so long. It took a class-action lawsuit to get the company to do the right thing. Many many thousands of owners were affected.One of the nice things about our 3.0-liter V6 Ford engine in our 2007 Fusion is the fact that it is not known to have any inherent problems at this stage of the game. It is dependable and reliable even though it might not be as sophisticated as some other engines in the marketplace.From all that I\\'ve read, the Sonata is a fine mid-size car. We went with the Fusion because of good past experiences with Ford products and the fact that the dealer, Sherwood of Salisbury, Md., is top notch in our book.  The Ford employee who graced us with the prelim numbers for the 2008 Mazda6 stated 190-200 HP for the 2.5L I4 and, after checking the post again, it is a DI engine. Remember, these are prelim numbers, but from a reliable source IMO. I am a Mazda employee, and have heard no such numbers yet. I will be more then happy to eat my words if the North American 2009 Mazda6 I4 gets more then 170hp! :shades: I have 2008 Mazda6\\'s in my inventory, the new Mazda6 will be a 2009, not 2008.  Hard to say how many engines will bite the dust due to oil sludge problems. My Dad has an i4 engine and the Camry is the 2000 model year. He got an extension on warranty. The worst things was a knock down on resale values from excellent down to just good. He has the oil changed ever 3K miles or so. That is another cost, the extra oil changes.Seems to be running just fine. Toyota should offer an extra $2,000 off the purchase of any Toyota car in the future to those caught up in this poor engineering fiasco. Overall, the car is not interior or exterior as trouble free as was his \\'91 Camry, which was a zero defect car. He just did the oil changes, air filter, tires, and spark plugs in nine years time. It was never back to the dealership once. I think the early 90\\'s to perhaps the mid-90\\'s was the last of best of the Camrys. I had a Corolla \\'98 and it was pretty much trouble free, sort of like the earlier Camry cars were. Dad\\'s 2000 is OK, and the only major concern is the oil changes all the time and resale value taking a couple or thousand hit due to oil sludge problems. Still has more resale value than does most any domestic car I can think of. Can\\'t think of any Toyota, at this time, which lights my fancy at all. Now, if they made a RWD Celica again, then..... The New Camry interior is not too hot, and exterior is sort of odd in some areas, so before any other considerations, it was off my list, when I was mid-size car hunting.L  About the only major \"foul ups\" from Hyundai have been the 1st generation Excel (a really big foul up) and the infamous overstating of horsepower about five years ago. I owned a car affected by that, found out its engine had 135 hp vs. 140. I got a $100 service coupon out of it, and there wasn\\'t actually a problem with the car, so no big deal.  Hyundai did lose some young buyers, when they refused to repair for no cost, a clutch problem on the 2003 Tiburon cars. Under warranty, of course they would not normally repair parts which can wear due to heavy use or loads, which on a manual transmission could burn out a clutch in one day. This however seems to be some faulty part, as it is most prevalent on the 2003 Tiburon. Don\\'t know if this is still in court, out of court, or what Hyundai is going to do about this issue. Of course, if they can prove no product defect, they will win in court. Alas, they still will have lost. Negative relationships with young customers is not a good thing, as they are the people with growing buying power, and some dozen cars later on in life, could have been a loyal customer. The flip side is that Hyundai may be reluctant to replace a part in a car which can fail due to over-stressing as in racing or dragging a car. The other side is pretty sure though they have a case of the old faulty part was installed charge against the company. Let me know if you heard of a settlement. Guess I personally would buy an automatic Hyundai and avoid the clutch models. L  So you can take that $100 coupon and buy a K&N air filter to get some of that lost HP back  Or go to See\\' and buy some candy, and just not worry about the HP.Hyundai Sonata is a good enough car, but those high fleet sales are not helping the resale values. It is really one company to watch, as they grow and grow. Wonder if the Elantra gets a new more powerful engine soon. Is it not approaching the mid-size class, as per interior room? L  I paid for my car\\'s 15k service with it. Hyundai has reduced fleet sales on the Sonata, has bumped up prices, and has cut back some on incentives over the past year. Yet they are still near capacity in Alabama when adding the Sonata and Santa Fe production. So they are not doing too bad IMO.The Elantra has been in the mid-sized class by interior volume since the 2001 MY, but is even bigger inside for 2007-8. It is definitely an alternative for me. Power-wise, it\\'s at 138, which is low for the class but since it\\'s smaller/lighter than others in the class, it\\'s plenty peppy for me. To me the Elantra is an interesting, lower-cost alternative for a car with mid-sized interior and trunk room but compact size, and a good complement of features including standard ESC on the SE trim.  The Elantra, once the bump the HP should sell even better than today, but then again, it is bumping into Sonata at that point. Gas mileage will be even more important with $82 a barrel oil now. A little more work on the steering and suspensions of the Sonata to tune for handling, and I would say it has arrived. As for looks, I think it is just fine when compared to some now trying far too hard for a change for the sake of change, and just doing strange things with headlamps and such. The Sonata look is clean right now. If they hold to long term durability high scores, things will continue upwards. The first half of this year, they were at around a 27% fleet sales, while it is not huge, perhaps they could half next year??? What are the numbers on Sonata? I thought they are selling under last year figures, but I could be very much wrong on that one. Loren  So what about moving it up a notch and buying a used car in the mid-sized range, in the near luxury (which would be luxury to my pocketbook) ? How many have done just that, with no regrets. I have thought about it, but always stopped short of acting on it. I see those BMW 3 and 5 cars, the baby Mercedes, and Cadillac, Lincolns, Acuras, and well let\\'s say a hundreds of older, hopefully well maintained luxury or near luxury, now selling at or below what it cost for base i4 mid-sized Japan or Korean car. Maintenance and replacement of parts is my fear, after hearing of some prices, like on Volvos, oh my! Would you say it is the transmissions which are the most concern in those used cars, and could it be some of the older models, with a stick or an automatic which is an older type, could be less costly and thus take some of the risk out of the equation? Or is it something one will do buy once in life, like buying a boat. Loren  I have 2008 Mazda6\\'s in my inventory, the new Mazda6 will be a 2009, not 2008. Thanks for correcting that. The U.S. version hasn\\'t even been unveiled yet! am a Mazda employee, and have heard no such numbers yet.You work at a Mazda dealer IIRC, right? The Ford employee I speak of works at an assembly plant if I\\'m not mistaken. Big difference.Employees of Mazda dealers aren\\'t Mazda employees either I always thought. Are they? I\\'m not trying to flame. Just curious.  \"Some of these preferences that come to mind are: steering wheel audio controls, \"manual\" mode in an automatic, extender on sun visor, doors that open without having to unlock first, automatic door locks, the \"old\" mazda6 type vents, minimal chrome, no wood or fake wood,...\"Wow, minimal chrome...does somebody still do that?I vividly remember riding in a ~\\'79 Camaro about 10 years later, and it had the most ghastly multi-toned aluminum type dash. Granted, the chrome/brushed aluminum is done with more taste now, but I still wonder how it\\'s going to age, and whether we\\'ll look back 10 years from now and wonder how the designers went so overboard for that fad.And that\\'s just the sedans. The over-the-top use of chrome on the dinosaur SUVs these days (think Escalade and Navigator) is enough to make any self-respecting pimp blush. Oh well, I guess they\\'re devoid of any real improvement ideas, and they have to go somewhere to stay semi-relevant.  Isn\\'t that aluminum look on the Camaro something of an aluminum tape applique, so perhaps the old one pulls off, and a new tape sticks on there.As for those GOOD things we now have on a modern car, the extending sun visor ranks amongst the best of ideas. The telescoping steering column is a great idea, though I wish they would pull towards the driver yet another inch or two, as I have short arms, I guess. What I do not like at all are those foot emergency brakes. The worst I have seen, IMHO, is the New Altima which has the foot brake position more where I would expect the clutch to be. Now it does rise upward of course when not engaged, but it is still in what looks to me in harms way if the legs swing up, such as in a wreck, or when I am twisting around getting in or out. Wait a minute, it is in the down position when moving in and out, which is even worse. I really do not like this. On the Aura it is not a good thing, but at least it is far to the left side. I want my hand brake. Loren  My parents had a tilt & telescopic steering wheel in a 1968 Plymouth Fury III. I think the T & T steering wheel was available before 1968. But, T & T is not something new. I agree with you in the \"emergency\"/parking brake location. In fact, my \\'71 Volvo had the brake lever between the driver seat and door. It did not impede entry or exit and did not get in the way of the shifter or console.  No, telescoping steering in column is not new, though many manufactures, like GM, did not offer it as a standard feature, even on a Cadillac CTS when introduced. How cheap is that? I believe it is now standard.Those swing-a-way steering columns were pretty strange. Guess it was a good thing. Your basic tilt is a good thing to have. A few cars did not have it. The older Miatas did not, though I am lucky as the wheel is in the right position for me. I owned a first gen. of a Miata some years ago. May get another one. L  I have always liked the wood look, real or not. Plood, as some call it, can be very nice when done right. If one car has plastic that looks like wood, and one has plastic that looks like brushed aluminum, I will pick the wood look. Of course, like anything else, the \"Plood\" in some cars, looks much better than the \"Plood\" in another.  My father\\'s 1970 Chrysler New Yorker had tilt and telescoping steering wheel, and probably a few other things you don\\'t see on today\\'s economy cars. If you think the new Accord is too big, you should have driven that beast. It was massive. There was obviously no fuel crisis back then.  Guess it was a good thing. Your basic tilt is a good thing to have. A few cars did not have it. The older Miatas did not, though I am lucky as the wheel is in the right position for me. I owned a first gen. of a Miata some years ago. May get another one. L My grandfather\\'s 1999 Nissan Frontier doesn\\'t have tilt either. It\\'s an XE Reg Cab model though, so it has crank windows, manual locks, a 5-sp man & 4-cyl combo, and doesn\\'t offer intermittent wipers (I don\\'t mean variable intermittent, I mean it has low-speed and hi-speed and that\\'s IT). It\\'s a hoot to drive though - the only manual transmission in my immediate family.  Glad you liked your Miata. I had an \\'71 Volve 1800E. What a great car for that era. Mid-size sedans are now as fast, have almost as good cornering ability and MPG is about the same. That was one helluva car until I had to replace it 13 years later (family and eventual maintenance cost). It was so far ahead of its time but is now so primative compared to today\\'s cars. It would cruise comfortably at 80 and give 31 mpg. Take it up to 90 mph and the mpg would drop to 26 or 27. LOL. (And that\\'s based on a full tank of gas, no trip computer-- miles driven /gallons used. Those were the days, 90 mph on a 2 lane road in rural Florida on rte 29 or 27.  Those are a classic and can be viewed at car shows these days. Really cool looking. The last car I know to have those small fins. Always wondered about that. Well the sport wagon, with the trapezoid window in the back has somewhat of a comeback as the C-30 Volvo. The Volvo sports car and sports wagon both were pretty cool. I liked another old model, the 164E, it was so classy.Wonder how Volvo is doing these days. The new c-30 has arrived, at least for taking orders. Nothing too exciting otherwise??? Loren  First car I was driving around was the family car, which was a \\'61 Buick LeSabre. Really cool how it looked with the windows down, and no center post (pillar). Probably not the safest way to build, no doubt. The Accord is not too big for a car, but perhaps too big now to be an Accord. Guess we now have the Accord Stretched Sedan. Oh doh, that is as bad as Toyota Racing Development! I won\\'t go there.... :blush: Loren  There is just something about driving a car with a stick which makes you always come back for more of that interaction with the car. Could be the control, may be having to actually do more to get into motion, possibly a bit of kid which comes out, as you try to get the most speed out of the engine, along with a bit of nostalgia, I would say.I love to downshift and upshift, and find the right gears to get the most out of the next turn. We have lots of curves and back roads around California. Shifting is all about the straight line performance, I take it elsewhere on the flat and straight roads of America. I am driving a car with a 5 sp automatic, which is really excellent at getting the job done for a sedan. It won\\'t be long though before the kid in me simply must row the gears once again. I hear the calling of a sports car! Now the money is the only hard part. Taking all donations for save the sports car addict fund. Interesting how people drive all sticks, for the most part in Europe, even in the most crowded of cities. The automatics are sooooooo very much better than the days of old, and still improving. That said, is even a paddle shifter the same fun? And that 5 sp. automatic I have is going to cost something like $5K or more to replace if it ever blows.Oh well, its all good. Perhaps that is the way to go, with an automatic for sedan and leave the stick to the sports car, or at least the paddle shift. - L  \"There is just something about driving a car with a stick which makes you always come back for more of that interaction with the car.\"Kinda- but after driving a stick for a looong time, I gave it up. It ceased to be fun in the stop and go traffic of the commute.  Wow, minimal chrome...does somebody still do that? Yes...  Yeah, I believe our 2002 Santa Fe (2.7 V-6) was caught up in that fiasco. Another instance of a law firm ready, willing and able to make some money on a non-issue (in my opinion of course). Our car also drove exactly the same the day before the disclosure as the day after. I got a bigger gift from Hyundai, we had a choice to extend the 100K mile drivetrain warranty to 120K OR extend the 5yr/60K bumper to bumper TO 6yr/75K (I believe) OR extend the roadside assistance to something....I forget. We chose bumper to bumper extension.  BMW didn\\'t have tilt on their 3-series until the E42 or E46, IIRC. My (least)favorite non-tilt steering wheel was my friend\\'s Peugeot, it felt like you were driving a bus.  Having been raised on the Central Coast, I have successfully managed to avoid an automatic transmission. Besides, those beautiful twisty-turny roads were too much fun not to take them whenever I could.Even running up and down 85 in the bay area, I never found myself wanting anything but a manual. The old Accord was a stick, as is the new one. I honestly can\\'t picture that thing being any fun at all with an auto. The Subie is a stick to, and while it feels great with a stick, it would be a bit pokey with an auto.  When you\\'re stuck in stop-n-go traffic for 2 hours a day driving ceases to be fun anyway regardless of what you\\'re driving.  after driving a stick for a looong time, I gave it up. It ceased to be fun Same here, but no stop and go traffic, it was more that it just ceased to be worth the trouble. I had manuals mostly because I got more gears, better mileage, and adequate power from a 4 cylinder engine...those advantages are now pretty much gone. Maybe if we got the engine choices that Europeans do, I might have continued...maybe I\\'d be driving a manual trans mazda6 with a 1.8L or 2.0L engine.Stepping on a clutch pedal and moving a shift lever is not something that I find particularly exciting the vast mjority of the time, it was just a simple task that needed to be done.  Here\\'s a question: which mid-sized sedans don\\'t do the plood thing at all? I know of a few, but are there others? The two that come to mind off the bat are the Mazda6 and Optima. Or does the 6 offer plood on some trim lines? Also some of the compacts-with-midsized-room don\\'t offer plood, e.g. Elantra and Versa.If we all band together, maybe write our Congresspeople, we can stamp out this scourge of plood once and for all!(Just kidding.)  When you\\'re stuck in stop-n-go traffic for 2 hours a day driving ceases to be fun anyway regardless of what you\\'re driving.Yeah, thats a lifestyle choice I would avoid, personally.  Here\\'s a question: which mid-sized sedans don\\'t do the plood thing at all? I know of a few, but are there others?The 2007 (2008?) Ford Fusion is/was available without plood. Our SEL AWD has piano black (shiny black plastic) trim. It\\'s a dust magnet but much more pleasing than plood. I really do dislike plastic wood, on any car.  I can bet most people couldn\\'t tell the difference between faux wood (plood) and real wood when the former is done right. In fact, sometimes, certain woods can look unnatural (like the dark \"real\" wood offered in Acura RL in the past and in Lexus LS).Real wood (but with matte finish) is an accessory on the Accord now, including covering the silver trim on steering wheel as well.I don\\'t have faith in silver/aluminum look plastics. They don\\'t age very well and are prone to scratch. And when they do get one, it really shows. Two out of last two Altima rentals had that issue. I would hate it in my car.I also see Accord getting a bit of TL treatment with some black plastic (a bit matte finished). It looks good and high quality, but also shows nail marks easily although it can be buffed off so it will age well.  I\\'m not a black-piano finish (or any other color finish) either for the same reason I can\\'t understand the latest fad with laptop manufactures using glossy exterior. They are hard to maintain, and show finger prints very easily. On the upside, they might help track thieves. :P  Technically, it should be \"ood-play\". :P  :shades:  Generally speaking it looks good, can\\'t say anything about the quality of the materials yet but just based on the look:1. I was hoping it\\'ll look more like TL/TSX interior than RL or 5-series type. I guess Honda designers have turned the new Accord into a poor man\\'s 5-series inside and out. I don\\'t dislike the idea but it just doesn\\'t look Honda to me anymore.2. That gear shifter looks CHEAP and like it\\'s lifted out directly from Civic. A good looking gated shifter like the one in TL will make the cabin looks even more luxurious.  I can bet most people couldn\\'t tell the difference between faux wood (plood) and real wood The beautiful thing for me is I don\\'t care  . Real or fake, the wood look is not something I find appealing in a car at all.  I\\'m glad to have company. Not everybody is as lucky as us though. :P That said, I would prefer plood over silvery/aluminumy plastic in *any* car. If I got an Accord with silver plastics (especially on the steering wheel), I will go for the wood trim as pictured earlier). In reality, give me either real aluminum or just nicely finished black plastic.Here is a close up of the audio controls in my 1998 AccordThe real beauty of it is not only that its layout is remarkably well thought out, but it has stood the test of time. The minor scratches are only visible under flash, but I can\\'t imagine any kind of silver/aluminum-looking plastic look as good after years (and 181K miles) of abuse.And I\\'m glad my TL doesn\\'t have it either (the shiny stuff is all real aluminum). Unfortunately, the new Accord does have some of the treatment that I detest (Climate control buttons in picture below, the rest appears to be similar to TL\\'s), but still not as bad as a lot of cars out there, and it is gun metal finished (slightly less prone to showing scratches than bright silver finish).  Only the basic shape of the dash is similar to 5-series. The design is all Honda, with controls placed logically (it is lacking some symmetry that was seen in the past) and having dedicated functions to buttons improves usability (a Honda tradition). The downside to it is additional buttons. But I would take more buttons to a few as most would once they realize the strengths. Just see the proliferation of real keyboards on cell phones now, makes it much easier to text.BMW goes with the dreaded i-Drive function that virtually requires attention off the road. Honda\\'s MMI interface (in Accord and RL) is similar but doesn\\'t integrate everything into it, just the features you should be using when parked anyway).I also noticed (in one of the spy pictures) that Hyundai is going with iDrive-like control at the same location (in Genesis).One of interiors that virtually everybody raves about can be seen in Audis. I detest them from usability point of view, but can\\'t recall anybody calling them cluttered or too small (they are located well below appropriate line of vision to boot).  What I am going to say maybe shocking but...I don\\'t like Audi interiors.I had an A4 for 2 weeks and it\\'s nothing to phone home about. I also don\\'t understand why virtually everybody raves about Audi interior. IMO Acura has the best interior design and is miles ahead of Audi.Back to Accord. I too don\\'t mind buttons, I actually like dedicated function buttons because I value simplicity. I was dissapointed that Honda moved away from touch screen to the i-drive like joystick with the RL. Apparently this design is here to stay by looking at the Accord.Also, you are right, when I said the Accord interior looks like the 5-series I was talking about the general design shape, not the layout.  Back to Accord. I too don\\'t mind buttons, I actually like dedicated function buttons because I value simplicity. I was dissapointed that Honda moved away from touch screen to the i-drive like joystick with the RL. Apparently this design is here to stay by looking at the Accord.That is a double edged trade off...a touch screen requires eyes off road time because you have to look at it to make your selections, but the joystick can be hard for some people to use and manipulate, especially if you push in to enter.  But with the joystick one still has to look at the screen in order to see what he/she is doing right? The touch screen is like a one step process and joystick is two:Touchscreen: I simply touch the icon.Joystick: I move the cursor to the icon then press enter.Same reason why I like gated shifter over the column one.  I find touchscreen to be extremely handy in my TL. However, the features I use on it are largely navigation related, which drivers are advised to use when completely stopped.For the rest of it, voice commands come in handy (unless the moon roof or windows are open or have someone in the car talking).The MMI is a solution to taking out some buttons that aren\\'t normally needed or will generally be combined into multi-purpose buttons anyway. For example, Bass/Treble or Balance/Fade control. Other than that I think the MMI will find its use mostly with NAV selection (again, I prefer to use voice commands when driving, and touch screen when stopped).  And I was recently offered $3.5K for it. But this car is a part time limo for my dog. I\\'ll offer you 4K for it if you bring it to Southern CA for me right away!  How about return airfare? I\\'m not going to walk 1800 miles to home.   How about you rent a 2008 Accord 1-way to get a real nice test drive experience?  Touch screens, joysticks???Don\\'t know anything about either or what you do with them, but both sound overly complex. I prefer what I guess would be considered primitive simple controls.I think I\\'d run away screaming from this:as well as this:While this:does not instantly appear frightening, it is also not anything I would want.  I wholeheartedly agree. Honda is putting way too many buttons on the center stack and in odd positions IMO. Fortuntately most of the important ones are duplicated on the steering wheel which I find very convenient. I know the Honda stack sits in a high easy to read and easy to view position. But what\\'s the point of that if all the buttons are too hard to find at first glance?Has Honda or Toyota put the climate controls on the steering wheel yet as Ford has?  Putting climate control buttons on the steering wheel is a waste. I rarely adjust the climate control as I suspect *most* people rarely adjust them.  There is an issue with the priority of controls. My \\'93 Accord had 3 buttons - hazzard, defrost, and fog across the top, then the radio, then the climate control. Cruise was on the wheel once activated by a button on the dash (I thought the \"enable\" button on the dash was silly, but okay).Now that the car audio system has more computing power than my old Mac Plus and electronic climate control - something that was supposed to be simpler - seems to have more buttons than a home stereo remote. We are at the low point of an evolution cycle right now. The system can be electronic, but knobs for climate control are still a better interface, IMHO. I think the great thing about the old Accord was the important things were BIG and at the TOP. In both the Legacy and the new Accord, I can\\'t find the rear defrost without looking for it (and in both cars its at the bottom of the console). This is not user-centered design.Still not as bad as the \\'90s Sienna where the audio system was at the bottom of the console and you couldn\\'t read the display from the driver\\'s seat. Heck, if you were shorter than about 5\\'8\" you couldn\\'t even reach it from the driver\\'s seat.  I\\'d rather have this: rather than touch screens, joysticks, dozens of buttons, etc...  The main VW complaint is who is the genius that made both the speedometer and the tachometer have the same scale? If they just made the tachometer x1000 instead of x100, I would be cool with it. And to make matters worse, the spacing is about the same between markings on the two dials.That particular VW looks like a base 2.5 Rabbit, I thought they had controls for at least the audio on the wheel.BTW - VW\\'s sunroof dial is one of the greatest things since sliced bread. You just turn it to where you want it, and it opens that much and stops automatically.  Hey I found someone that agrees, and uses the same example:VW display  That photo is actually 2005 Jetta \"value edition\", which is what my wife drives. I\\'d assume base rabbit is the same, but they may have upgraded some things.I don\\'t have that much problem with the numbers on tach and speedo being the same, though I\\'d rather have the tach be X1000, like most are. However, the speedometer is hard for me to read for some reason, my wife has no problem with it...so I guess if I drove it all the time it would be okay. (it also reads about 5 mph high)  Nothing can beat this for simplicity and ergonomics. Still one of the best looking interiors I\\'ve ever seen.  I couldn\\'t agree more. It holds up well too. This is my interior after 165k miles.Doesn\\'t have the great lighting of your picture, but it still looks good to be 12 years old!  Nothing can beat this for simplicity and ergonomics. Still one of the best looking interiors I\\'ve ever seen. For the most part, I agree, however there are a few caveats.1. Why did they put the climate control above the radio. The radio has a display that you need to be able to read while you are driving. The closer it is to the FOV out the window, the better. Also, the climate control has fantastic big knobs that are easy to reach without looking, even more reason for them to be lower.2. Why do you need to hit a switch buried on the dash to activate the cruise? It has been correct in the \\'03+ as its now on the wheel with the rest of the cruise controls.3. Why is the sunroof control no-where near the sunroof? Why do I have to hold the button down to open it?Nit-picky - probably, but that is how things improve. Its all about Kaizen.  Simplicity is great, but people want all these new gadgets, and with them come more buttons to operate them. My 03 Accord only has two things I would change. First, I don\\'t really have a problem with where the moonroof button is located, but I do wish it was an auto open and close, so I didn\\'t have to hold it down. Second, I like leather seats, but would rather them not be power operated. I find manual seats easier, and quicker. In 08 I think they solved the moonroof button problem (not sure), but screwed up the A/C vent placement. And it will probably be freezing in hell before they have manually operated leather seats. Life will never be perfect, I guess.  Putting climate control buttons on the steering wheel is a waste. I rarely adjust the climate control as I suspect *most* people rarely adjust them. Well you are entitled to your opinion but I don\\'t see that funtionality as a waste but rather a convenience. The standard Ford HVAC system uses 3 large dials and a couple of buttons, as praised above by some, and the auto system uses all buttons. You can only get the steering wheel buttons if you get the auto HVAC system. Since it is harder for most to operate small buttons rather than large knobs it makes perfect sense to duplicate the common functions on the steering wheel when you opt for the auto HVAC system. If you don\\'t adjust your HVAC often then you are lucky. In this neck of the woods it\\'s not unusual for the temp to drop 10-20 degrees in a matter of minutes in the Spring, Fall and Winter so adjustments are frequent enough that you\\'d want an easy to operate HVAC system.

Since it is harder for most to operate small buttons rather than large knobs it makes perfect sense to duplicate the common functions on the steering wheel when you opt for the auto HVAC systemIn the Ford, the HVAC buttons are placed farther away from the driver, so I can see where steering wheel controls would be needed there. In the Accord the Auto Climate control temperature knob is the closest to the driver, so putting controls on the steering wheel is unnecessary. Doesn\\'t the Auto Climate Control adjust for the varying temperature? I thought that\\'s what it\\'s for?  Simplicity is great, but people want all these new gadgets, and with them come more buttons to operate them.Oh, most certainly people do want that stuff. I realize that I am not in the mainstream on that at all.  I set my auto temp control to 68 and be done with it. Have the compressor engaged switch set to auto all year \\'round. As I suggested for me it\\'s a waste, but hey...  Speaking of gadgets and such I believe that integrated turn signals in the outside rear-view mirrors should be standardized and mandatory on all vehicles. Our 2007 Ford Fusion doesn\\'t have this safety feature but I sure wish it did.  Speaking of gadgets and such I believe that integrated turn signals in the outside rear-view mirrors should be standardized and mandatory on all vehicles. Our 2007 Ford Fusion doesn\\'t have this safety feature but I sure wish it did.Many Euro cars are required to have repeaters on the sides. I actually retrofitted these to my Contour (the Mondeo has them where the 24v badge sits). The US spec says something about how the turn signals have to be visible to the side to a certain angle, but I don\\'t think its as effective. It also looks cool.   Doesn\\'t the Auto Climate Control adjust for the varying temperature?I happen NOT to like auto control. Either its a blast of cold air in your face or steaming hot air sweating out my feet. Gimme knobs with printed temps instead of blue and red and lets call it a day.  Yes, there is something to be said for simple. I like this dash, plain though it is. It\\'s ergonomically simple (note how the main controls are canted towards the driver), has solid and smooth controls (damped, with rubber grips on the HVAC knobs), and high-quality plastics (mostly padded). De-contenting has not affected dashboards on mid-sized cars in a good way over the past few years, IMO.  Have you tried this feature (Auto Climate Control)? You set it to the temperature you like, and you\\'re basically done. Sure, if the cars been sitting in the sun, on a 98 degree day, you may have to initially turn it up to cool off quicker, but after that, nothing could be simpler. If you\\'re getting a blast of cold air in your face, or steaming hot air on your feet, you need to adjust the temperature, or the vents. :confuse:  You do know that the auto climate control works just like the A/C in your house right?As matter of fact it\\'s even better. The house A/C unit has to be manually switched from cool to heat but the one in the car is fully automated.72 degree means 72 degrees all year long...Can\\'t get better than that.  Get into your car after its been in the sun in 95 degree heat. Turn the a/c on auto and tell me if it blows 72. Its never been my experience that it will blow 72 if you hit auto. Now, if you press the button or turn the knob to 72 that\\'s a different story. But can\\'t you get that with a knob? :confuse: No hate, I dont have auto a/c in my car but if it comes with it next time I won\\'t be complaining.  I&#146;m not sure what you&#146;re complaining about, but how is auto blowing in your face worse than manual ac blowing in your face? Besides a simple solution that involves positioning the vent away from your face, auto is designed to maintain a set temperature. I prefer 78 degrees at home and in my car, and that is where I prefer to leave it.With manual AC, you have to change the settings frequently. With auto, the system keeps it steady. When at home, do you prefer to have the thermostat in &#147;auto&#148; or &#147;manual&#148; mode?I don&#146;t know about the new Accord, but the auto climate control in my Acura TL goes a step further (actually couple of steps further, but I will talk about only one that relates to the topic). It uses GPS to automatically control temperature, depending on the position of the sun relative to the car. And there is no blowing in the face. Besides, you can select the vents too, independently on both sides (the dual mode feature, in addition to dual zone), and if you still prefer manual, hit that AC button, adjust the fan speed and voila!  I don&#146;t know about the new Accord, but the auto climate control in my Acura TL goes a step further (actually couple of steps further, but I will talk about only one that relates to the topic). It uses GPS to automatically control temperature, depending on the position of the sun relative to the car.Every other vehicle uses a much simpler sunload sensor that measures the sunlight actually hitting the driver and passenger of the vehicle. Instead of using satellites to coordinate the position of the vehicle on the earth, the other vehicles measure the amount of sun on the occupants and adjust accordingly. Amazing technology :P   The most intelligently and user friendly dash design IMO is in 1998-2002 Accord (EX models). It is high enough to still have the road in view even when operating the lowest buttons. Controls are grouped by function and an impressively symmetrical design with clearly identified center. While not the best angle, this picture demonstrates a part of it. The center is the preset button &#147;2&#148;. It has a small notch (like &#147;J&#148; and &#147;F&#148; keys on computer&#146;s keyboard). Above the audio controls is buttons/dials for AC. Fan speed dial to the left, temperature control dial to the right and ac/vent control buttons in the middle.The quality of material used is impressive, and even after 10 years/181K miles of use, the markings are still intact. They operate with same precision that they did with 4 miles on the odometer.But, I won&#146;t compare newer models to the old in terms of design. The basic idea of grouping buttons, and laying them out hasn&#146;t changed at Honda. There are a few more buttons but that is also because there are a whole lot of new features. My 1998 Accord EX-L came with only a CD player and manual AC. Now we&#146;re talking MP3, CD changer, dual zone climate control, navigation system\\x85The only way to reduce the number of buttons is go the i-Drive way. I say a big NO to it. Reminds me of a quote by Einstein:&#147;Things should be made simple, but not simpler&#148;.Honda&#146;s layout generally requires a quick glance to reach out for a defined function. And in some cases (as in my Accord), most of them can be operated without requiring a glance. When I see people complain about Accord&#146;s dash, I just shake my head in disbelief.OTOH, the dash in my TL is confusing. Fortunately, I have other options to operate virtually everything (touch screen, steering wheel controls and voice controls). I\\'m not a big fan of MDX\\'s layout either. It looks good, but everything is squeezed in a small space.  Doesn\\'t the Auto Climate Control adjust for the varying temperature?Yes, but if the temp changes outside you may want to change it depending on the system. The auto HVAC in my Mazda6 needed constant adjustment. It was by far the most finickey system I\\'ve ever encountered. All most of those things do is cycle hear or A/C and fan speed. If your body temp is warmer or cooler one day or the next you\\'ll want to adjust it. At least I always did.  Non-NAV TL might be using that technology, but there must be something more to it than simply sensing the sun to be overhead or on the side. Perhaps greater precision (if it matters).   Every other vehicle uses a much simpler sunload sensor that measures the sunlight actually hitting the driver and passenger of the vehicle.Right, but the position of that and the actual temp sensor varies from car to car. I found that the sensors in the Mazda6 I owned weren\\'t nearly as accurate as those in my dad\\'s 87 Taurus, \\'96 Sable, and \\'06 Zephyr. All three of those did an excellent job of keeping the cabin comfy. I had to adjust the one in the 6 quite often and others on the Mazda6 thread would agree with me. We had a long discussion about it over there a while ago. Hopefully they change how that all works for the \\'09 model.  I haven\\'t had to change temperature on my side in months. The passenger side does get changed frequently. And since the settings are tied to memory, even if a friend of mine (or service folks) changed temp on my side, it goes back to my setting everytime I unlock the door with my primary key.  The only way to reduce the number of buttons is go the i-Drive way.Touch screen will accomplish the same task too.I\\'ll take touch screen over joystick/i-Drive in any given day.  It can be much easier than a touch screen. Many cars today use HVAC controls with 3 rotary knobs: mode, fan, and temp. And usually they have at the center of the dials push buttons for recirc and A/C. I find those controls intuitive and extremely easy to use, even with gloves on. They aren\\'t as flashy as a touch screen and they don\\'t cover a center console with a bunch of buttons, but they just plain work.  3 rotary knobs ain\\'t going to cut it with navigation system.  I use the AAA folding paper system. L  Don\\'t see it as all that great, though it has a coolness factor... well at least the first year it did. Guess it wouldn\\'t hurt to have it.Now the yellow running lights, down low, like on the Corvettes C5 or the Camaro, was a great idea. Have all the cars use yellow, and placed down low and wide apart in the front of the car. Do away with headlamp running lights. L  I really like the auto climate control. I usually set mine for 78*. Although, at this time of year, in the afternoon I\\'ll often \"up it\" to 80*, just to keep the A/C from coming on. I don\\'t need heat, but the A/C is just a bit cooler than I\\'d like on this less than 4 miles ride.A week and a half ago I started out at 7:30 AM to pick up a buddy to play golf. Temp was set at 78* and was giving heat for a while (not blasting it). When I picked him up we were on the road about 8:15 with about an hour and a half to go to the course we were playing. Sometime during that hour and a half the climate control gradually changed over from heat to A/C automatically, without having to touch any dials or settings. That\\'s the beauty of climate control, it maintains a (nearly) constant temperature, once the engine is warmed up, without the occupants having to make periodic adjustments. (It\\'s like Goldilocks, not too hot or too cold.)  Seems to work just fine with my nav system--eyes and brain.  And then there are the voice-controlled nav systems--look ma, no hands!  Yeah, the thing to understand is that when you set the temp for, say, 68, auto climate systems don\\'t blow 68 degree air, they blow whatever temp you need so that the cabin is 68 degrees. In the summer, that\\'s ac, in the winter thats heat.In my 2007 Camry Hybrid with plasmacluster, the system works great. We will never buy a car without it. I had it on my 02 Intrigue as well--the TCH system, not surprisingly, is better. You can still switch between recirc and outside air, so that can temper the veracity of the heating and cooling if you want.  There is a problem with touch screen. You have to look at it. Many times with buttons, you can get away without having to look for it. Besides, touch screen is a two step process. First, you must activate the screen via a button (so you need one anyway). For example, in my TL, if I wanted to play the third disc, I have following options:1. Use voice commands \"DVD Play Disc Three\"2. Press disc selection button (button 3 for third disc)3. Press \"Audio\" button Touch \"Disc 3\" on the screenSo, while touch screen provides a visual for a quick glance, it also requires a glance and a two step process. Selecting the button 3 requires a glance (and if the button is placed well, then a glance may not be needed, like in the new Accord... just find the third button and press it).With something like i-Drive, there is absolutely no way to do things without taking the eyes off. Voice commands is the best way.  I\\'m not a fan of rotary dials for climate control selections. It is okay for fan speed control but I don\\'t like it for mode or temperature control (especially with auto climate). I guess I\\'m a digital age guy. As for modes, I find this set up extremely convenient... just point and shoot. In fact, I usually don\\'t have to take my eyes off the road to operate this in my Accord. However, in the TL, if I were to fiddle with vents (which I don\\'t), it will be a pain since it cycles thru selection which will require taking eyes off the road. But then, it does offer voice controls as well so cycling isn\\'t needed.  Voice is great for certain things, very short commands, or things that save a visual search through a menu structure. That is one of the reasons its great for phone dialing...Call Bob is better than searching through all the names to find Bob, selecting it, and then having it dial.For tuning the radio, with direct presets its easier to reach over and push \"1\", unless its a touch screen because as Robert pointed out, you have to look. Someone at VTTI did a dissertation on how long it takes to perform all these in-vehicle tasks using different methods. I will post the link if I can find it.  That\\'s not bad, but its eight controls vs. five and depending on how small/flush/packed the buttons are, hard to work with gloves/mittens on. The top row appears to be a little tightly packed, for example.Edit: I miscounted, ten controls vs. six (forgot temp and fan controls).  I\\'ve never had problem using those with gloves. Each of those buttons is large, an inch wide by 3/4 inch high.  My 92 Accord had the buttons in the picture, and they were much better than the old slide levers (remember those?). The cycling isn\\'t really a problem in the 03 Accord, because I will do that before getting on the road. Don\\'t usually have to change it after that.  At first glance those buttons for mode seem like they would be better than a rotary dial. I wonder how they are to operate with winter gloves on though?I don\\'t think I\\'d like auto climate, as I do like cold air blowing in my face at times and hot air blowing on my feet at other times . I can see where digital settings might work better for auto climate temp setting, though. With manual, I think a dial or slider for temp is better. For fan speed, I can\\'t think of anything that would be better than the rotary dial.  Isn\\'t the 2006-2008 Sonata ranked in the Large car catagory? And the 2008 Accord as well?   Yes, both sneak into the EPA\\'s large car category by interior volume.But then, some compact cars like the Elantra, Sentra, and Versa are considered \"mid-sized\" cars by the EPA based on interior volume.So it gets confusing. But lots of choices for people looking for a \"mid-sized\" sedan, depending on what they mean by \"mid-sized\". For me, the smaller the car is on the outside and bigger it is on the inside, the better I like it. So cars like the Versa hatchback, the Fit, the Elantra, the Sonata, and the MPV (RIP) appeal to me.  Yes, both sneak into the EPA\\'s large car category by interior volume. Accord with a sunroof is still midsize.  Accord LX with a full-sized Kleenex box in it is mid-sized too. I was thinking that the 2008 Accord is probably one of the worst uses of extra size I\\'ve seen in a car. Consider that the sedan is 3 inches longer (to 194.1\") and the wheelbase is 2.3 inches longer, and yet there is only 0.3\" more overall leg room (+0.4\" in back, -0.1\" in front). And the trunk is only 14 cubic feet, less than in some compact sedans. Where did all that extra length go? At least the interior width is up by 1.5\" with only a 1.1\" increase in exterior width, and the front passengers get 1\" more headroom from the 0.9\" increase in height (no change for the rear).  Comfort is more important than actual inches. Reviewers have commented that the interior is more comfortable as spacious. :confuse: Did an Accord run over your puppy?  Perhaps the ultra powerful large 3.5L V6 takes more room up than the ultra powerful smaller 3.0L V6?  That\\'s a thought; how much longer (front of the car to back) is the 3.5L engine compared to the 3.0L engine?  No, but thanks for asking!  Hyundai is in the business of selling new cars, and offers a generous warranty to those people. As a secondary level, those buying a Hyundai used get a more normal warranty. It is spelled out clearly on their website, which is very easy to access and read, when compared to most brands requiring you to contact a dealership for details. The GM warranty of 100K miles may indeed match some people\\'s needs, if they drive more than say 15K per year. If they are driving 20K miles a year, it helps. As for increased quality, it appears that GM and most manufacturers have increased quality since I would say 2001. Most, but of course not all, cars seem to be getting more reliable during the 2002 model year and on, so I would say yes, they are paying having to do less warranty work on those cars - makes sense. Has GM quality doubled??? Come on now, of course it has not doubled, unless you compare it to a couple decades ago. Mazda quality has possibly dropped on the Mazda6 or has been less than stellar the last number of years, the rest of the line is not too bad. The Miata seems bullet proof. I was not aware of the warranty changes. Maybe you should ask Ford about that?Toyota power train appears to be questionable, based on reports by customers on this board (which is not too precise of a way to determine reliability of anything ), as the Honda transmissions seem to have recently improved and are more durable for the V6 models now.If a warranty means a lot to you personally, value it heavily when purchasing that new car. If it is but one element among many, just consider how much it really does mean to you. Buying a car like a Hyundai, which you must keep a good long time for it to be the best value, you may be better off with a long warranty -- they have a long warranty. L  Companies offer better warranties to give peace of mind to consumers who are concerned of additional costs while paying off they\\'re new car. Not to mention to ease claims of the cars being less reliable. Companies such as Honda and Toyota have had no intentions on increasing they\\'re warranties because they have their names to rest on(for label lovers). Even though you would think, since Hondas and Toyotas are supposed to be super reliable cars, why cant they offer a better warrenty? It shouldnt hurt them too much, right?  I agree - so let\\'s stick to the features and attributes of the specific cars. The various warranties manufacturers offer may be an interesting side conversation, but they really are not the focus here.  What about Chrysler\\'s lifetime warranty? A pretty good idea IMO.How many keep one car their whole life.It will get more buyers than the 100mi/10 year one from Hyundai/KIA and with a few exceptions will be cost effective for the company.I dont know anybody that has kept their car for their lifetime. :confuse:  I wonder how many people trade for a new car at least partly so they can get a new-car warranty and not be at risk to pay for expensive repairs, especially to the powertrain e.g. automatic transmissions that are very expensive to fix/replace. I know that is one consideration for me when I buy a new car, to get the benefits of a factory warranty and keep my repair costs low for several years. If a car has a lifetime powertrain warranty, how might that affect car buying patterns? Just a thought.  I wonder how many people trade for a new car at least partly so they can get a new-car warranty and not be at risk to pay for expensive repairs, especially to the powertrain e.g. automatic transmissions that are very expensive to fix/replace.Getting a new car warranty was certainly a significant factor in our decision to buy a mid-size 2007 Ford Fusion. A power train warranty is what sets a new car apart from a used vehicle. Guarantees are certainly part and parcel of the buying decision.  Yes, I like the peace of mind that comes with buying a car with a long warranty or with the Honda or Toyota name on it. To me, the Honda or Toyota name is at least as good as a 7/100K warranty without needing the warranty. In other words, I get MORE peace of mind from buying Honda or Toyota then I do from getting GM\\'s or Chrysler\\'s warranty. Secondly, I\\'d buy a Hyundai because their warranty meets my minimum requirements for the original owner at least.AGain, proven companies don\\'t need a warranty, unproven one\\'s do.  I don\\'t see a warranty as a big factor. I bought a car I have confidence in, and don\\'t anticipate expensive repairs. Maybe I\\'m just lucky, but I have never had an expensive drive line repair. I guess if it ever does happen, it could cause me to change my thinking. We\\'ll see.  Oh I do. I know a relative driving the same VW he had in college. But then again, it is a rather simple piece of machinery. New cars may not be around more than a couple decades. L  Its the same block. The old 3.0 and the new 3.5 should be about the same size, and the 3.5 may actually be lighter.  I already responded earlier, those buttons are big enough for all but hulk-sized fingers (even with gloves on). If 1 inch by 3/4 inch button is small, what is that tiny slider knob going to do?You may like rotary dial or slider knob, for me that is 80s/90s era. I prefer point and shoot.As for manual ac over auto climate control, latter is still a luxury, but will likely become a norm eventually. At home, I prefer leaving the thermostat in auto mode. And don\\'t like vents blowing air on my face. If I needed air, I would by a pedestal fan.   If I were to buy a 1-2 year old car, I would look for certified cars like those from Honda, Acura and Lexus. You get extended warranty with those, much more than the base warranty.  AGain, proven companies don\\'t need a warranty, unproven one\\'s do. I am wondering then why Lexus\\' warranty is longer than Toyota\\'s and why Acura\\'s is longer than Honda\\'s. I consider Lexus and Acura to be proven companies. :confuse:  I wonder how many people trade for a new car at least partly so they can get a new-car warranty and not be at risk to pay for expensive repairs, especially to the powertrain e.g. automatic transmissions that are very expensive to fix/replace.That would be being penny wise, pound foolish. With new cars, you lose money when one drives car off the lot (a lot more than a transmission repair might cost), and then comes monthly payments.I considered trading my 1998 Accord when it hit 100K mile mark. The idea wasn\\'t around saving money from repairs, but the new car factor. Then I realized, if I have a car that was paid off in 2.5 years, has absolutely no problem, why splurge?A few years later, the same thought came back. I finally did buy a second car, but only because I have been driving a lot and found an exceptional deal on a car I wanted (TL).Ten years and 181K+ miles later, I can reflect back and consider not having made a single loan payment in 7.5 years on the Accord, and only expense has been around gas and scheduled maintenance. $15 radiator hose doesn\\'t count.IMO, it is a bad idea to buy a new car based on the fear that it might start giving you trouble. Unless, you opted for a car with a proven history of problems, then you got into trouble by choice and deserve it. Unless repair costs almost equal monthly payments, I don\\'t consider it a bright idea to buy new.  Additional warranties and stuff in Lexus and Acura are sold as an incentive to buy those brands. They aren\\'t doing that to show to the world that they are any more reliable.Or, are you still trying to make a point that longer warranty = better quality?  Yesterday, at the local Cadillac dealership, they had an \\'07 base CTS parked next to an \\'08 CTS fully loaded - direct injection and blah, blah, blah extras. The \\'07 is $31K before any discounts, but that new \\'08 is $47K. I kid you not! What, a baby Caddy? They look pretty close, though the new one has less balance to it. Seems like the eye goes to that overdone front, and kinda stays there. Looks like the Cadillac emblem is looming large these days, as it is now closer to that of a Frisbee. If you could say bargain the base \\'07 down to a cost of $29K, it would make the difference between the two some $19K. Now, take $2K off the overpriced \\'08 and it is still $17K difference. Heck, you could buy another car to run around town with and keep the Caddy for the longer drives, with that sort of pricing.Here is another jaw dropper; a Volvo C30 for $31K. Has the World gone made? Loren  Or, are you still trying to make a point that longer warranty = better quality?I, for one, don\\'t believe a longer warranty equals better quality. However, a longer warranty certainly does have the potential to be a real money-saver should an engine or transmission decide to self-destruct.A life insurance policy for a drive train is a good thing; the longer the better. It\\'s common sense.  Oh heavens, there have been warranty wars since I was a child. Chrysler ups warranty, then GM & Ford would up their warranty, which in turn would lead to yet another one upsmanship. Many years ago that was the famous 7 yr. plan, and in more recent times it is, well the 7/70K plan, which in turn gets beat by the 10 year plan of Hyundai, and now ends with the Chrysler lifetime warranty. Somewhere in the middle of all this is the GM 5 limited 100K plan. Guess the real question to ask is would you buy a car you did not like, just because it has a longer warranty, so you can be miserable for a longer period of time? If you had two cars in mind, which both seemed very-very fine to you, then a warranty difference could tip the scale. It is all about adding up that which is good, that which is mediocre, and that which is less in a car when comparing, so yes, the warranty is important as a part of the buying decission. Due to $85 per hour labor and so much electronics, and more high tech transmissions, which are expensive, and such, the warranty becomes a bit more important than it once was for those keeping a car for many years. Cars hold up well, and last a good long time, but what will happen to the technowizard cars of today ten to twenty years down the road? Alas, so many buy or lease every three to five years, it becomes someone else\\'s worry.L  I don\\'t expect my cars to have major warranty related issues under 100K miles anyway. If there were, I probably won\\'t settle for that brand.When the dealership tried to sell extended warranty to me on the Accord, I smiled and said, no thanks. I\\'m here for a reason, instead of signing papers at the VW dealership couple of miles down the road.$900 (the number I was quoted for extended warranty) would have expired 4 years and 81K miles ago, and without getting used.  I had a PT with the 7/70 plan, which was good, but have now sold the car, and don\\'t see me in a Chrysler any time soon. That said, what is the deal with this lifetime warranty. Is that not one of those, \"if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is\" , things? Or do they rob Peter to pay Paul? Is the bumper to bumper then 3 years? That is not so bad I guess. One could a be a smarty and ask if that is the life of the car, or the life of the company, but I won\\'t do that :P . Guess it is a good thing they offer here, though perhaps not as good as the Hyundai plan. Guess it all boils down to fitting the need of the individual. If I was to be choosing between a Sonata and a Sebring, I am sure it would take all of one second; the Sonata is the car, but due to warranty so much as every other element of the buying decision, then one can add the nice warranty. Same goes for the car I did buy, the Honda, which has shorter warranty. Simply can not see driving what you could not stand to own just to get a lifetime warranty. Now perhaps a Dodge Charger or 300 would be much nicer, and thus throwing in the warranty is a bit more candy. And yeap, Honda, please feel free to offer more warranty in the future. :shades:  I have never bought a car warranty, but isn\\'t an Accord 5 sp. tranny like some $5K to replace? Just thinking down the road a ways here.....  I wouldn\\'t know. I will be surprised if any transmission in mainstream cars would cost as much to replace.  From what I have seen, certified means they have added yet another thousand or two to the price. It is like a $15K private buy, becomes a dealership $17 to $18K buy, which gets upped another notch to $18k to 20K when it is a certified car. Which, to me is certifiably crazy. I have seen USED Scion tC cars on the lot for the same or higher pricing than a new one. Just nutso! Is this just not adding $2K in warranty. I realize they are suppose to do all this checking and fixing, but for at least Ford dealership I went to, this was NOT the case. Tested a Mustang with a grinding sound from the front drivers side wheel, and a clunk when it went back into first on a stop. Then I test drove another Mustang, from the same dealership, and told the salesman, \" hey look the check engine light is on.\" Then there was the Sonata test drive. I wanted to use a used one to test out how it accelerate and such. Well I tried to adjust the lumbar support and the lever fell to the floor.While you hope to be getting a better car, inspection wise and well serviced, I do wonder. Perhaps it is not worth the extra paid over the private buying of a car. Seem to save $2K to $4K. That said, a dealership, once bargained down price may be closer; say $1K difference???Loren  I worry about price on a car when I start to negotiate. On a new car, it starts with MSRP, and on used, depending on age and mileage. I won\\'t pay whatever the dealer tells me. I did just that on 2006 TL a little over a year ago, paid $28K for a 1 year old car (MSRP $36K). There are plenty of private buyers that try to overprice their cars anyway.  I don\\'t recall saying anything like that. I was asking why Lexus and Acura have longer warranties than their non-luxury counterparts even though there was an assertion that proven companies don\\'t need long warranties.Personally I think companies offer long warranties for two reasons:* Buyer expectation: this applies to luxury brands, i.e. people expect a better warranty when they pay a lot more money for, say, a TL than an Accord.* A way to stand out from the competition: this applies to brands like Hyundai/Kia, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, GM, Ford, and Chrysler. There are only so many ways to stand out from the competition in the mid-sized family car class. You can do it with features (and some do that), you can do it with power (some do that), you can do it with a reputation for quality and reliability (ala Toyota and Honda), you can do it with price, etc. It\\'s expensive to add features and you can\\'t build a reputation for quality and reliability overnight, and prices can only go down so far. But you can add a longer warranty overnight. As long as your product quality is OK, it won\\'t cost the manufacturer much to do it and may actually help improve long-term reliability scores because people may tend to have their cars serviced better knowing that if they don\\'t, it could void the warranty.I am rather puzzled as to why Honda, Toyota, and Mazda among others grant competitors this advantage. It would cost them very little to offer longer warranties (at least I think it would) and it would take away a competitive differentiator.  Probably not that much. For example, a friend of mine recently replaced the failed 5-speed tranny on his Odyssey (about 90k miles) and the cost would have been around $3000 had he not had an extended warranty.  I am rather puzzled as to why Honda, Toyota, and Mazda among others grant competitors this advantage. It would cost them very little to offer longer warranties (at least I think it would) and it would take away a competitive differentiator.Because they don\\'t need it, like Chrysler, GM, Suzuki, Isuzu, Hyundai and Kia have. Do you think if Hyundai didn\\'t have the reputation that it did, they would still offer that warranty? No.When a company struggles to do business, they need steps that helps them grab attention. Look at Chrysler. Why did they start offering lifetime warranty in the middle of the year? Because their sales suck. This is yet another marketing strategy to get customers to their door step and not unlike offering massive rebates. Many automakers don\\'t need it, or not to exceptional levels. Why would they do it?  Maybe, for example, because the increase in sales of Sonatas to individuals over the past two years is coming from someplace?When you have up-and-coming competitors like Hyundai and Kia, and desparate competitors like Chrysler and Mitsubishi, you don\\'t wait for them to get in better health before taking action. You try to kill them, or hurt them, when they are relatively small and weak.Maybe if Honda, for example, had offered a longer warranty on the last-gen Accord, they would not have had to offer such large incentives--and even then see its sales fall off.  Incentives have to be offered on clearance. Are you telling Hyundai and these other automakers that offer long warranty don\\'t have to offer incentives?Seriously, I find it rather amusing that you dig really hard to find things to talk against anything but Hyundai.  That is not what I said.Glad you find my posts so amusing, but why not stick to cars rather than taking jabs at those who have a different opinion than you do?  I prefer point and shoot. What does this mean :confuse: ?At home, I prefer leaving the thermostat in auto mode. And don\\'t like vents blowing air on my face.Yes, well that is not a very good anaology, there really are not a lot of similarities there. One difference is when I walk into my house it is not over 100 degrees from sitting in the sun all day, like the car.  Some pics to hopefully distract people from the warranty discussion (yawwwn...)  I like those I beams - very cool. This is a covered parking garage, which is a tough of class, no doubt. So what car is that with the big butt? It is getting to the point, when in a darkened view, they all look the same. Is it the Mazda6? L  Looks like Monday it is strike a deal, or strike GM day for the Union. Yet another element of a buying decision, the stability of the company selling the vehicle. Could come a day when GM pulls out of the manufacturing in USA and Canada. Not saying it is planning on doing so, but it sure looks like profits would be greater, and it is tempting to manufacture elsewhere, as they seem to be doing better at selling elsewhere, such as the popularity in China. Another what if, is that GM could decide to go into bankruptcy, after or during a strike period, and start over as a leaner company, not necessarily as a USA manufacturing based one. Just a thought. What would this do to the USA economy, and the stock and bond markets if GM just said, we throw in the towel, the debt is too much and we can no longer make it?Management these days may be thinking a bit farther ahead than in the past, and the Unions perhaps may want to consider all possibilities at this stage of the game. A high stakes chess match is soon to unfold. L  Fortunately the Mazda6 has projector type headlights, so changing the halogens over to HID\\'s doesn\\'t create much glare for oncoming traffic. But I can see more when driving at night, so I love having them. I used a fisheye lens for that pic and although I tried to use the de-fishing part of my picture developing program, but there are still some minor proportion issues in that pic. The angle also accentuates the rear of the car a bit too, but maybe the Mazda6 does have a big butt (I don\\'t personally think it is too big since my view out the back is good so reversing is safe). I just put on some window visors (although the pic is a bit dark and small so it may be hard to see) but ever since then, I\\'ve been getting nice comments from people (mostly from people I don\\'t even know) saying how they like how my car looks. I\\'d like my car without these compliments of course, but its nice that other people also see my car as good looking enough to tell a total stranger and not looking like everyone else\\'s where they wouldn\\'t even notice it.  I had to say it after seeing your &#147;points&#148; that relate more about dismissing Accord. Here is another example.I was thinking that the 2008 Accord is probably one of the worst uses of extra size I\\'ve seen in a car. Consider that the sedan is 3 inches longer (to 194.1\") and the wheelbase is 2.3 inches longer, and yet there is only 0.3\" more overall leg room (+0.4\" in back, -0.1\" in front). And the trunk is only 14 cubic feet, less than in some compact sedans. Where did all that extra length go? At least the interior width is up by 1.5\" with only a 1.1\" increase in exterior width, and the front passengers get 1\" more headroom from the 0.9\" increase in height (no change for the rear).Yet, and you either missed it or deliberately left it out, all those increases have added up to increase the interior volume to 106 cu ft, larger than any of its direct competitors and on par with bigger cars. As for trunk space, Honda&#146;s approach to use a 5-link double wishbone in the rear (as opposed to less bulky but simpler multi-link/torsion beam/MacPherson Struts suspension that others use) eats up space. In addition to that, I don&#146;t know if everybody uses a common standard to calculate trunk space. Honda uses VDA method globally, and it results in a smaller number compared to other standards as it disregards small nooks and crevices (akin to filling up cargo with sand/water and measuring the volume versus using standard size blocks to measure volume, the latter is VDA process).That said, overall length is not a good measure to draw the conclusion you just did. A car can be longer for a lot of reasons (for that matter, Accord V6 is slightly longer than Accord I-4, and that is due to a lip spoiler which is standard in V6, and as you may have guessed by now, it doesn&#146;t add to the interior volume). First generation TL was a compact sedan and actually only 2&#148; shorter than this Accord. Acura RL has the same exterior dimensions as this Accord (including the wheelbase), and it is about 3 cu ft smaller.Bumpers and shape of cars can contribute to additional length too. Compare Camry or 300 to Accord. Honda went for a real bumper (which adds 1-2 inch to the length). Camry and 300 have no bumper. The Toyota and Chrysler are also flat nosed. Accord&#146;s nose has a slight tapering (additional couple of inches). An inch or so might be extra in the rear bumper. Add them all up, and you will figure out that not always do a car&#146;s length dictate interior volume.And that aint no opinion.   I don\\'t think your explanations have anything to do with the wheelbase, which increased by 2.3 inches. Where did that 2.3 inches go?BTW, the same question would apply to the Fusion vs. the Mazda6. Fusion stretched wheel base by 2.1 inches, but only 0.5 inch of that shows up in increased leg room.  Explain to me how did Accord gain 3 cu ft? You guys are making it sound like the increase in dimensions went nowhere.And no, wheelbase doesn\\'t explain legroom. Do you think Chrysler 300, which has 120\" wheelbase (10\" more than Accord) offers almost as much advantage in legroom? Accord has 80\", while 300 has 82\" (total).Altima\\'s wheelbase is about an inch shorter than Accord\\'s, but it has about 2\" less legroom than the Accord. Again, is it all determined by wheelbase?Besides, measurements are one thing, reality is another. The points of measurements are critical in the outcome.  Explain to me how did Accord gain 3 cu ft? You guys are making it sound like the increase in dimensions went nowhere. Width is a big chunk of that, I bet.I think a lot of length went into the fact that the car has more style (good or bad) than the previous more practically shaped model. Same thing happened with the Civic I think.  My opinion on the new Accord...Like the overall exterior design. Lack of standard bodyside mouldings and bulging headlights are two items I would change.Climate and audio seem to be a bit busy with too many buttons. I\\'d prefer more dials though after I spent more time with the car it might change my opinion.Did not drive it, so no driving impression.Will be interesting to compare it with the new Mazda6 and Malibu once they are available.  This is where I don\\'t find a lot of importance in the cabin volume stat... if it doesn\\'t result in more room for the passenger or driver as measured by leg room or shoulder room, what good is it? Who knows, maybe some of this extra square feet is below the windshield or back window in which case it has little impact on passenger comfort. To me, passenger comfort is more related to the space that a person needs to fit in so leg room and body room are the key measurements not cabin volume. Volume is important for a trunk, though, since that is where you will put stuff anywhere in it\\'s area and not in assigned spots like people.  There is a fractional gain in leg room, and some of the use of length may have gone into the trunk space. I mentioned VDA method for that reason and since we\\'re nitpicking on inches, if the additional space isn\\'t large enough for a \"VDA block\", it is left unaccounted for.Accord\\'s primary gain in interior volume comes in front seat headroom, shoulder room and hip room (which saw the most improvement but it is not a part of cabin volume measurements, only legroom, headroom and shoulder room are).As for width, Honda added 1.5\" to the track which brings with it a shorter turning radius than 2007 despite of longer wheelbase and larger tires. The track grew more than the overall width, which also provides for a squarish footprint for greater stability, a Honda tradition.Longer wheelbase is used primarily to improve ride quality. Also worth noting is that Honda bumped up the size of the fuel tank from 17.1 to 18.5 and moved it further, but lower, towards the front.  As I mentioned in my previous post, cabin volume accounts for only:Head room (front and rear)Leg room (front and rear)Shoulder room (front and rear)So, it doesn&#146;t account for space under the windshield or the rear glass. You can&#146;t add space under the windshield and add EPA volume to the size. At least one of the three measurements quoted above will have to change.That said, those measurements don&#146;t necessarily depict everything. There are set points from which those measurements are performed. So, if I were measuring leg room, I could push the lower part of dash further at that point and advertise a longer legroom (and in turn, gain EPA volume). But it is unlikely to be appreciated in reality unless people fit those measurement criteria.  But a double wishbone suspension is a good thing. Perhaps more costly to manufacture, but a good thing for handling no doubt. If I needed more trunk space, I guess a minivan or suv may be the call of the day. Honda trunks look large to me, but then again I once owned a Corolla and a Miata, so any trunk looks huge. L  Yep. In Accord, double wishbone is not for namesake. To me, it is a huge selling point. Someone who notices small things will really appreciate what it brings to the plate.To me, 14 cu ft of useful space is plenty. There are a few cars with as much or more advertised volume but not as practical. I fit more stuff and easily in my Accord (also attributable to wider openings). I have never understood why people want more (Taurus, for example, has a whopping 21 cu ft of trunk space).  Well that\\'s a REALLY easy answer - I took a road trip to Oklahoma City (750 miles away) with two friends this summer. We spent 6 days, and had the clothes for a trip of this duration. My 2006 Accord\\'s trunk was at capacity with all of our \"stuff.\" We originally had 4 of us going total, and I\\'m glad we didn\\'t; we couldn\\'t have fit the last persons stuff in without leaving some things behind.When you can have more without a penalty elsewhere, more will always be better than less.  Assuming equal space distribution for the three of you, the fourth person would have forced you to have at least 19 cu ft of trunk space. Perhaps only Taurus would have worked in that case.   Personally i\\'d take more legroom in the backseat(although I never sit in the back) or possibly a reclining back seat(nice touch that utilizes extra trunk space) over a larger trunk anyday. My Sonata\\'s trunk has plenty o\\' space, i\\'ve yet to run into an instance where I didn\\'t have enough cargo space.  A longer warranty won\\'t help Honda sell. It\\'s the same reason most logical sane people don\\'t buy an extended warranty, they are worthless for Honda\\'s and Toyotas. Bad tranny you say.....Honda covers them for free whether you bought the extension or not.... They step up to the plate when needed.On another note....If I was a GM or Chrysler customer that bought one month before the warranty extension, I\\'d be boycotting the dealership until they give me the same; of course, it would of been my own stupidity for accepting the original offer w/o the long warranty....  RE: Trunk spaceI guess you don\\'t play golf and/or have never taken a 3 some or more on a golf day trip.   They still don\\'t put kids in the trunk when sneaking into the drive-ins, do they? I know, what\\'s a drive-in, an eating joint? Are there any drive-in movies left? How many recall what the movies seen were all about?Now the real old days when a trunk was a trunk, was pretty bad. Talk about an afterthought once the car was invented. :surprise: Ooops, we gotta take stuff along, other than just Grandma and Grandpa! L  I definitely remember cramming kids into the trunk to get into the SLO drive in, and that was in the 90s. Either that or having a bunch of us lay down in the back of a p/u truck. Ahhh those were the days :P  Chrysler is back dated to 2007 models, so that is not an issue. I believe GM just said sorry, but I may be wrong. Have not checked into it lately for any change of heart. A longer warranty is a good thing on any and all automobiles. It adds value to a car and added protection while you have the car. Pretty simple. L  The Los Osos fog was not a good thing. But sneak in some brews and your favorite gal, and all was well. Some really terrible movies, but that was OK. A drive in was all about the fun factor and not the movie quality.  Yet, and you either missed it or deliberately left it out, all those increases have added up to increase the interior volume to 106 cu ft, larger than any of its direct competitors and on par with bigger cars.I could also say that you either missed it or deliberately left it out, but Accord\\'s total interior volume is less than that of at least one other car in this class, by nearly 2 cubic feet. I won\\'t mention which car that is because you or someone else will just jump all over me about it, say something about who I work for or what stock I own, and we don\\'t need more of that kind of stuff here.But it\\'s good that you have pointed out that because of a design decision Honda made on the Accord, it has less cargo volume than some other cars in this class that are several inches shorter (or even smaller than some some compact cars). So in the future when you or someone else mentions something about a mid-sized car that\\'s not positive, we can just say, \"That was a design decision by the manufacturer.\"   It\\'s the same reason most logical sane people don\\'t buy an extended warranty, they are worthless for Honda\\'s and Toyotas. OK, I\\'ll bite: if most logical, sane people don\\'t buy extended warranties and they are worthless for Hondas and Toyotas, why do Honda and Toyota offer then on their new cars? Let me guess: for all the illogical, insane people who buy Toyotas and Hondas?   I never thought of buying a car by the cubic foot. Guess the Crown Vic is a bargain, or is it just big on the outside. How many dollars per cubic foot is the Accord? :confuse: L  I am wondering about some of the long term durability issues as well. My \\'93 Accord had metal covers over the control arm bolts to protect them and keep them from rusting. It also protected the upper ball joint. That cover is missing on the \\'07. I noticed a few things like that, the way the lower control arms are mounted, and the steering rack are different and less protected/shielded.I guess time will tell.  How big trunk do you need for golf day trip? It won\\'t be worse than a weekend trip for two, a dog and with a large cooler, would it?Excuses... keep \\'em coming.   \"At least one car\" makes for a fantastic argument. At least you didn\\'t go out on a limb and compare it to Taurus... a whopping 9 cu ft advantage over Accord. For sake of fun...Mazda6: 111 cu ftAccord: 120 cu ftTaurus: 129 cu ftAccord is merely midpack, in terms of length, width and cubic footage. That said, buying based on cubic footage I do when it comes to appliances. I just returned from Home Depot looking for wine coolers as a matter of fact. :P Cars, OTOH, have to be a lot more than that.  Hey backy...My guess: his answer will be for the money-hungry dealers to make money.My personal view: partially to make money for dealers, partially to be able to say \"we\\'ll match Hyundai\\'s warranty\" and figure it into the price, partially because Honda\\'s are in fact machines with parts that wear out, or break. They are not the invincible machines that last 50 years with nothing but maintenance. Are they reliable? Yep. Most surveys put \\'em above average; some at the top of the class. Are they perfect? Nope. My 2006 Accord had warranty work done twice in 1,000 miles for a loose interior rear-view mirror (the glass was not glued to the plastic housing, causing MAJOR vibration issues) as well as a gas flap with a tendency not to open.Perfect? Nope. Wasn\\'t enough to make me dislike my car (I didn\\'t buy it on perfect reliability alone, but for a plethora of reasons including, but-not-limited-to, dependability). I think there are Hondas that come from the factory with no flaws (unlike my vehicle which had two). I also think that there are Hyundais and Fords and Chevrolets and Subarus and Mazdas etc... that come this way too. Andres, I\\'m a Honda guy. Between me, my parents, my grandparents, and my great aunt there are 6 Hondas, and only 1 Nissan. 86% of my immediate family\\'s vehicles are Hondas! But guess what, they aren\\'t all flawless.1996 Accord LX - 175k, several repairs, currently has moderately worn shocks, never stranded b/c of the repairs 1997 Civic LX - ~113k, alternator, exhaust system 2 years ago(we live in Alabama where we haven\\'t had snow in 7 years)2002 Accord LX - 89k, rattle in the dash, too-tight throttle linkage yet-to-be addressed2005 Odyssey EX cloth - 35k, misaligned rear bumper, tailgate rubber seal not properly in place, airbag sensor recall, whistling windshield 50-60MPH2006 Accord EX cloth - 24k, (((See Above)))2007 Civic EX - 26k, NONEListed above are the Hondas in my family, their mileage, and their problems. I drive all these cars at least once a month, with emphasis on the three Accords. As you can see, with the exception of dad\\'s new Civic, they are all far from perfect. My aunt\\'s Odyssey has required a nice long time in the shop for all of its issues. I\\'m a Honda guy, but I\\'m not bowing at the big \"H,\" and after seeing and feeling the interior in the new Accord, I may not be driving away in an Accord at my next purchase opportunity. I am nit-picky about interiors, and was very disappointed by the 2008s.  Taurus: 129 cu ft Not in this class of vehicles though. A Grand Marquis is bigger than a Yaris is, too!   This works other ways. For example, why would anyone need a passenger volume of 106 cubic feet on a mid-sized car? That\\'s much more than anyone needs, unless they have some sort of gland problem. And who needs 190 hp on a four-cylinder family car? Or 260+ hp on a V6 family car? How fast do you need to go to the grocery store, anyway??If Accord has a feature or attribute, it is a Good Thing. If it doesn\\'t have a feature or is lacking in some attribute compared to the competition, no one needs that feature or attribute. At least, that is what I\\'ve gathered from this discussion.  IIRC, Honda and Toyotas don\\'t offer extended warranties. It is a third party deal. OTOH, Honda and Toyota warranties are straight forward and not convoluted like Hyundai. I\\'m surprised by many that they don\\'t have a clue about Hyundai\\'s ten year warranty being non-transferable outside of \"relationship sales\". So, why does Hyundai do that?And speaking of warranties, Honda and Toyota offer shorter (5-year/60K mile powertrain) warranty on new cars, but they extend it to 100K miles on certified used cars. This allows used cars have better value. In fact, one could find a six year old Accord right now, and if Honda certified, it would be covered under warranty for miles remaining up to 100K. (In Hyundai\\'s case, the car cannot be older than 4 years, and must have less than 48K miles on it).  Ask C&D. They were one of the reviewers who would often put Accord\\'s size as one of its cons.So, how much cabin size/trunk size is good for you? Do you assign it a number, or do you go by actual experience (comfort, driving position etc)? How about power? Believe me, Accord EX-L/NAV would be my choice if I do go for the Accord, and not because it has 190 HP versus 177 HP. I couldn\\'t care less about 150 HP versus 200 HP ten years ago!So, why exactly do you have a problem with these?And no, I don\\'t think all Accord\\'s features make sense to me. I\\'m one of those people who thinks Honda could have done a few things differently than they did (in terms of features). The discussion gets to the point that apparently you\\'ve been gathering, thanks to Hyundai flag wavers.  (sorry colloquor, couldn\\'t resist stealing your words).  Class be damned. We aren\\'t going to compare full size cars only to full size cars going by EPA\\'s definition. For me, family sedan it is, it could be the tiny Mazda6 or the behemoth Taurus, and everything in between.  Well, the host is likely to ask you to create a new comparo, because the Taurus is not intended as a competitor to the vehicles in here. It\\'s also not included in the listed vehicles in this forum. Ford\\'s entry here is the Fusion.  Why do Honda and Toyota have to offer extended warranties on used cars, if they are so reliable?This web page looks to me like Honda offers extended warranties. Note the words \"factory backed,\" for example. The company that underwrites an extended warranty (typically an insurance company, since extended warranties are in effect insurance policies) is irrelevant to who offers, sells, and backs the warranty. Honda Care is advertised by Honda, sold by Honda dealers, and backed by Honda.http://www.hondafinancialservices.com/Planning/honda.aspAnd I\\'m not sure what you mean by Hyundai\\'s \"convoluted\" warranty. Its terms are very clear to me, a Hyundai owner. If other Hyundai owners don\\'t take a few minutes to read the warranty on their cars, how does that make the warranty \"convoluted\"?  Then I will ask the host if we should be discussing Accord and Sonata here. :P  Why do Honda and Toyota have to offer extended warranties on used cars, if they are so reliable? Do you believe companies offer warranties if they sell products that aren\\'t reliable?  Oh c\\'mon now. We discuss the Azera in the full-size discussion, as it is designed to compete with those sedans. We discuss the Sonata here for the same reason. I\\'m just repeating what pat had told me before when I mentioned the Accord in the full-size sedans forum.  I will wait for Pat.   Your comments are interesting, given that a short time ago you brought to our attention the fact that the Accord has more passenger space (106 cubic feet) than any car we are discussing here. So I took that to mean that you believe the the sheer interior volume of the Accord was a positive feature of the car. But when I pointed out that another car in this class offers more interior space, suddenly cabin/trunk space is no longer important to you, now it\\'s all about \"actual experience\" (comfort, driving position, etc.).I don\\'t have any problem with the Accord\\'s features. I think it has lots of good features (although I am one who thinks hp in family sedans is getting out of hand). I just get kind of tired with people holding up attributes of the Accord as great things, until it\\'s pointed out that some competitor has more, or has some feature the Accord doesn\\'t have. Then it\\'s, \"oh, that really isn\\'t important.\" If we are going to compare cars, we can at least be fair about it. Some cars do some things better than others. Accord shines in a number of areas. But it doesn\\'t mean it trumps competitors in all facets.  Do you believe companies offer warranties if they sell products that aren\\'t reliable? You have a good point. I guess that means mid-sized cars with longer warranties, e.g. Avenger, Sebring, Galant, Optima, and Sonata, are quite reliable.  Yes - Hyundai posts the whole enchilada on the warranty, in great detail. And it is not all that long a read, and pretty easy to comprehend. Most companies do not. - Loren  Avenger and Sebring are less desirable, as in not selling well, thus a longer warranty to help move stock. Dittos on Galant. The Optima and Sonata still have the stigma associated with Korean cars after the earliest efforts fell short, and thus a longer warranty. And in general, it is matching those other cars within the same league. Honda and Camry may choose like warranties, and the two may wish to match say Nissan if they have some extra super warranty and start selling more cars. The warranty wars are nothing new. Ford, Chrysler and GM all did that number years ago. It is an old dance. Those extra long warranties as in from here to eternity are usually out of desperation however. Kia and Hyundai are still, right or wrong, here in import car land, not seen as having the same status as the Japan makes. This could take a decade, though who really does know how long, to turn around where it comes to perceived quality and goodness of product between Korea and Japan. Heck, many see this as an opportunity to buy the Korean product at lower prices, with longer warranty, and are very happy indeed with their decision to venture into the future of a possible world of equality amongst Korean and Japan brands. Bold Moves. Oh doh, that\\'s someone else. :blush: Loren   I guess that means mid-sized cars with longer warranties, e.g. Avenger, Sebring, Galant, Optima, and Sonata, are quite reliable. Longer warranties, if you look at the reliability ratings, do not mean the car is more reliable. Maybe these manufacturers are hoping the cars are sold to someone else (who the warranty cannot be transferred to) before there are major problems. So I guess if the car is not so hot, there\\'s a good chance of that.  Longer warranties, if you look at the reliability ratings, do not mean the car is more reliable. Maybe these manufacturers are hoping the cars are sold to someone else (who the warranty cannot be transferred to) before there are major problems. OK... so the fact that Honda\\'s extended warranty is longer (in miles at least) than that of Hyundai or Kia or Mitsubishi or many others does NOT mean that the Accord is more reliable than the mid-sized cars from these other brands? This is getting kind of confusing! :confuse:  Accord isn\\'t considered more reliable based on length of its warranty. You\\'re the one digging this up, and getting confused in the process. :sick:  You were complaining about exterior size and made it sound like \"where did it go\". I followed it up. Now, you\\'re complaining again, with the examples I quoted.Trunk size and cabin volume has never been the primary focus of my purchase. You\\'re the one throwing things around and creating a mess. Didn\\'t I say it couple of days ago that if I wanted to go cheaper than Accord, I would go Civic?I just get kind of tired with people holding up attributes of the Accord as great things, until it\\'s pointed out that some competitor has more, or has some feature the Accord doesn\\'t have.I won\\'t be surprised if Chery (when it arrives in America) has far more features. Would that make them benchmarks?Seriously, If I couldn\\'t afford it, I\\'d be willing to let go of a feature or two to drive a better car. You can\\'t convince buyers like me to buy a car based on discounted price and additional features. They are all that for a reason!  My warranty also outbrakes all of the warranties in this class. Plus, my warranty looks much better than yours. I can fit a bookshelf in my warranty, which is something none of the other warranties can do. And my warranty is much more fun than the other warranties in this class while not sacrificing comfort, practicality, or reliability (JD Powers and Consumer Reports both indicate that over a 5 year history, the difference between the most reliable and below average cars is less than 1 problem over that 5 years). Combined with the fact that I can buy my warranty for more than a few thousand dollars less than other warranties is nice frosting on this warranty cake. All in all, I really like my warranty. I also like the car that comes with it...  Robertsmx,Toyota does offer extended warranties. I purchased my 3 year/50,000 mile warranty through Toyota. It is called the Platinum Extended Warranty....I got it for a little under $600 and can cancel it at the end of my lease if I\\'m under my mileage and receive a refund for the remainder.  OK... so the fact that Honda\\'s extended warranty is longer (in miles at least) than that of Hyundai or Kia or Mitsubishi or many others does NOT mean that the Accord is more reliable than the mid-sized cars from these other brands? Indeed not, and the long warranty on the Hyundai does not mean it\\'s more reliable either. It just means Hyundai is taking the chance that you will sell the car, before major repairs are needed. Since it\\'s a less desirable car, I can see how they would come to that conclusion.   says it best: zzzoom6, \"Midsize Sedans 2.0\" #5869, 24 Sep 2007 9:16 pmLet\\'s drop the warranty arguments - they have nothing to do with the actual features of the cars and all you folks are doing is just baiting each other.  I think you are right on with that. I don\\'t very much think that we will ever be seeing ANY of todays cars running around the area in say 20-30 yrs, but something like those older VW\\'s and many others are still plugging along. Granted they aren\\'t the ideal vehicle, or for that matter even a desireable one but they are still around and running (? after a fashion?) How many of today\\'s will be able to say that. My guess is with the electronics, and hydraulics, etc involved not very many will make it to that length of time. My own opinion.van  Pat, to clarify: are you saying we shouldn\\'t talk about warranties at all here? What about things like resale value and pricing? Those aren\\'t features of a car either, but I think you would agree they are important factors for many people in choosing a car. And they factors that are mentioned in most reviews Edmunds.com does on cars--along with warranties.  I am saying that we\\'ve beaten the warranties to death and we need to get back to the actual cars. If you want to argue the point, email me please.  No, I am just asking for a clarification, not an argument. Thank you, and have a great day.  I guess you don\\'t play golf if you don\\'t know how much room is needed for four golf bags, shoes and umbrellas (and frequently a couple of small coolers). That\\'s OK. The golf equipment would require alot more trunk space than would be required for a weekend trip for 2 with a dog in the back seat.  Really? You know what I have been carrying in my car, and that it takes less space than four golf bags?Before you talk about golfing, do you realize what an additional cubic feet looks like?  I\\'m guessing a cube that\\'s 12\"x12\"x12\" ?   No, you will have to divide that by 1728. (Before worrying about putting another golf bag in it :P )  Wrong. 12\" = 12 inches = 1 foot.Why do you have to argue with everything anyone posts?  What are you arguing about? Chill out, I had a smiley with my post for a reason.Besides, we weren\\'t talking about conversion from inch to feet and vice versa. PS. You could use google to do it for you. :shades:  Besides, we weren\\'t talking about conversion from inch to feet and vice versaWhy else would you divide by 1728?  OK, I\\'ll bite: if most logical, sane people don\\'t buy extended warranties and they are worthless for Hondas and Toyotas, why do Honda and Toyota offer then on their new cars? Let me guess: for all the illogical, insane people who buy Toyotas and Hondas? Easy answer:Reason one: To make money and virtually 100% profit margin.Reason two: Because there are insane, illogical buyers out there, and they do buy Honda\\'s and Toyota\\'s too!Reason 3: Some people will pay for anything.  First off, the problems with your 2006 Accord were minor, and occurred at purchase or prior to.... Therefore, they fall under dealer prep damage and/or initial new car warranty. So to apply that to value in an extended warranty is irrelevant.If it doesn\\'t break by the time the warranty runs out, with Honda\\'s and Toyota\\'s I\\'ve found it\\'s just not going to break. Minor items excluded. Honda\\'s are not perfect, but their drivetrains basically are (once they figured out how to make an auto V6). All the major components that are expensive and matter a lot never seem to break down. The Odyssey and Pilot are not Honda\\'s best work or examples. The Civic and Accord are. That is their bread and butter.Of course, the butter seems to be souring a tad with the OHIO built Accords and Civics, the 2005 Civic my wife had was also flawless and built and assembled in Japan. They just lack some QC on assembly at Ohio.... those Accord nuisances you described should never happen.  When I take a nice walk, I do it without all that stuff. And I don\\'t have to chase around a little white ball. It appears to save me money, and a lot of time hauling around all that stuff. Guess a rather large trunk is required for a team of golfers. Or you can pull a trailer, take along a gold cart, and such. Those Dodge Sprinters look like they could hold a lot of stuff. :blush: L  To convert from cubic inches to cubic feet.   that our 2007 SEL Fusion\\'s trunk space, 15.8 cubic feet with all seats in place, may be the largest in the mid-size sedan segment. Anybody know of a mid-size with a larger trunk size? I think this is a definite plus in a sedan. The Fusion also has 100 cubic feet of cabin space.  The current Sonata is listed as having a 16.3 cu ft trunk. That would make it a little larger than the Fusion trunk. The Sonata\\'s cabin space is listed as 105.4 cu ft.  I didn\\'t even mention my dad\\'s 2003 Accord which had to have a new headliner, new stereo, and had NUMEROUS rattles.His 2005 was much better. The 03 was Japan built, the 05, Ohio.My 1996 was made in Marysville, OH, and has been a great car.  the 96 was great, but not flawless????Maybe the 2003 Accord problems were due more to first year troubleshooting and rushing a \"class leader and benchmark\" to the market. They did beat everyone else by about 3 years before others caught up.I still feel as if the 2005 Civic from Japan was simply much better built and put together than my 2003 Accord from Ohio. Still... the 2003 Ohio Accord was MUCH better built then any domestic car I\\'ve ever been in.  Besides, we weren\\'t talking about conversion from inch to feet and vice versaWhy else would you divide by 1728?To convert from cubic inches to cubic feet.I give up. You can\\'t argue with people who contradict themselves.  the 96 was great, but not flawless???? Nope. It had its emissions system recalled early in life. It\\'s thrown a CEL twice because O2 sensors go bad. They had to extend the warranty to 14 years/150k miles on all emissions system components. It also has a resonating \"growl\" around 2,000 RPM that nobody can seem to locate the cause of, but it doesn\\'t affect performance at all, so I\\'ve learned to live with it. It has had this since I got the car 5 years ago, and well before that when my grandmother still owned the car. It also has a tight temperature control which has caused me to break 3 plastic knobs in 5 years (this was before they made the control electronic in 1998).So, no, not flawless. Very good, but not flawless.  Maybe the 2003 Accord problems were due more to first year troubleshooting and rushing a \"class leader and benchmark\" to the market. They did beat everyone else by about 3 years before others caught up.I think what was even more amazing was how fast they let it fall behind. In 2007, it is missing many of the features of its peers. It was very GM like the way dealers were dumping the \\'07s and the price adjustments required to keep them moving.  It also has a tight temperature control which has caused me to break 3 plastic knobs in 5 years (this was before they made the control electronic in 1998).The \\'93 did that as well. The Honda dealer had the temp knobs in a bin on the parts counter.  Yep. Once, they didn\\'t have one, so they took one off of a 1997 Accord LX V6 on the lot and put it on my 1996 for me, and ordered the part for the other vehicle.I think this is pretty common for Accords of this vintage. I could be wrong, but did 1989 and earlier Accords have a rotating knob, or the slider?  I got curious about 1989 Accord and found this. That is clearly not from American version (it has automatic climate control). Some of the design elements are still around in 2008 (multiple vent control buttons, in fact, fan speed is also via a button instead of knob).  the 96 was great, but not flawless???? No vehicle is flawless. I have owned a Toyota Celica, Honda Accord, Mitsubishi Eclipse and currently Mazda6 and Subaru Impreza (wife). 1991 Toyota Celica ST was blowing blue smoke at 100K, automatic tranny modulator went at 93K, A/C went at around 80K. Traded in with 165K on it.1991 Honda Accord LX went through numerous ignition coils. Interior upholdstry started to give way at around 80K I think. SOld with 135K on it.1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS-T, nothing mechanically went wrong, just not thrilled with how the interior was constructed. Traded with 75K2005 Mazda6 i, nothing so far. Currently 35K2002 Subaru Impreza 2.5RS , head gaskets replaced at 50K, fuel lines replaced at 60K, cracked intake manifold, 2 O2 sensors, loose heat shield, hard shift in 2nd gear, still not fixed...clock died, and center consul electrical circuit went. Car currently has 67K on it.  And let\\'s not forget wheelchairs, trust me if you ever have to carry one in your trunk you can definitely appreciate a trunk that is large enough to easily load and unload one easily.  These big butt cars of today, are sort of like the old stationwagon of long ago. OK, say a foot lower in the back, and add steel where the glass was, and you got it. If a person needs to haul a lot, do get out the tape measure and see how the cars compare. It is not a big deal to me. I had a PT Cruiser which was very good for those taller items a car with a trunk simply can not accomodate. -L  Which features are missing? I bought the SE V6 Accord. Seems like more stuff than I can shake a stick at, but then again, I am not one for fluff, and complexity. Only thing which is strange to me is a lack of an iPod input. Of course the car has a 6 disk CD changer. My first car with a CD anything. I like having a CD to play now and then, but still use the radio the most. I drove other cars before buying the Accord. The Aura XR has a paddle shifter and 6 sp, but I am pleased with the 5 sp. in the Accord, with the D3 selection for holding gears on twisty roads, if needed. Oh yes, there is something missing in the \\'07 - no adjustable lumbar support. Seats are OK, but would be better had they had more lower back support. That is a real point against it. Added up all the good vs. bad after testing other cars, and sum total came down to Aura vs. Accord, so I guess I just don\\'t see how it was lacking in features. I test drove a used Sonata, and the lumbar support lever fell off, as I tried to adjust the seats. As for comparison tests by magazines, it is not a bad thing of course to be a winner in anything, but there are many times when the second, third or even the forth choice just happens to be your number one choice. Pretty simple, if you are a person liking say handling, to perhaps prefer the Accord with the double wishbone suspension, or if you happen to like the snappy looks of that new Fusion or Milan, it may be a winner. If you look at the 0-60 or a 60-0 test, and then the slalom, and your car is lagging by a few ticks, so what if you wanted a nice interior, more trunk space, or like the chrome on the outside - so what I say. To another person, that engine sound, the later g test, the steering feel is important to, and your car is say second place in the test overall, once again so what. It is YOUR first place car. Your $$$$ to spend. Loren  I\\'ve definitely had to measure the depth of trunks when looking at sedans something that is hard to judge just by looking at it on the outside.  My first Accord (92 EX) was made in Ohio, and was cheap to maintain. In 12 years 140k miles it cost me less than $1000 in repairs, and most of that was for a transmission computer. The temperature control knob cracked twice, then I figured it out. If I turned the knob halfway (12 o\\'clock) let it sit for a couple of seconds for the cable to release tension, then I could turn it the rest of the way without cracking the knob. If you have one of these, take note. The o-rings leaked into the spark plug tubes, so I changed them myself, very cheap. One leaky A/C pressure switch (a whole lot cheaper than a compressor), and the fuel pump went out, probably from running the tank too low a lot. My 03 EX V6 was also made in Ohio, and it has not needed one repair yet in 4 years, and 48,500 miles. Many people complain that the 7th gen Accord rides rough, but maybe the combination of slightly heavier engine, and softer leather seats gives my Accord a smooth ride, on all but the worst of roads. I couldn\\'t be happier with it, and as long as this Accord holds up as well as the last, my next car will also be an Accord. I think the \"Japan built is better than Ohio built\" claim is total crap. You can get a good or not so good car from either location. Japanese assemblers are no more perfect than American assemblers, I think.  Good to see that you, lilengeerboy & the Grad are being perfectly honest about your experiences with your good cars (Accords). No car is perfect and those willing to share problems on this forum make a positive contribution (and can still \"love\" their cars). My \\'05 Sonata, almost 2.5 years old with 16,700 miles, has been \"perfect\" SO FAR. That won\\'t continue forever...something is going to break at some time in the future. It does on any car, emphasis on the word \"any.\"  Yes, my 92 Accord needed a few repairs, but for under $100/year, I\\'ll take that every time. It was a great car, and I loved driving it, even when I had no place to go.  I\\'m trying to post a couple of videos of my two Accords on youtube at the moment. My camera died in the middle of uploading the first one, but you can hear my 1996 crank and run for a moment. Nice and smooth. I\\'ll try and post the full version later! The second video is of my 2006 EX Accord cranking, with a light rev there towards the end. I posted this to show how much quieter the 2006 is. The shots are taken with the same camera, 2 minutes apart. My 1996 AccordMy 2006 AccordThe 2006 has 24,615 miles. The 1996 has around 175k.  Well you would think it is impossible to have a zero items replaced over a long life, or say nine years, but my Dad had a Camry like that. It was a very base model \\'91 with a stick. If it required a tail light bulb or an inside overhead bulb once, I may have forgotten that. I do know it was never back to the dealership once. I recall one of the vents was lose or broken on the air conditioning ducts on the dash. But in nine years time you would think more would go wrong, but it simply ran without fail. It looked really good when sold, with some signs of wear on the driver seat. Those simple cars back in the early 90\\'s by Toyota are likely to be the longest lasting of them all. His 2000 Camry is OK, but is no comparison to the zero defect and no repairs needed car of \\'91. Of course few people these days opt for roll up windows and such. Loren  Yes, an early 90\\'s 4Runner from Toyota was indeed, perfect and flawless for my family for about 75,000 miles, when it was handed over by sale to a Cousin and he kept it forever, but I never asked him how it did; but being as he kept it forever, seems like its logical to assume it did well.My friends \\'94 Prism from Geo (made by Toyota) was indeed flawless. It was tortured by aggressive young teenage male driver/drivers/riders, but the car simply was bulletproof, tank proof, bomb proof, missile proof, and even crash proof. Nothing would ever fail. It was floored everywhere he went, everyday.  Had I sold my 1998 Accord at 150K mile mark, it would have been perfect as well (except for burnt out lamps, which were the only things that &#147;died&#148;). Over next 32K miles, a cracked piece of radiator hose has been it. That is about as perfect a car I can imagine from any era and feature list. And that is a made in Ohio car.So, now I&#146;m hoping to push it thru Spring and then spring for another Accord, or the new Fit if it is here.   I couldn\\'t be happier with it, and as long as this Accord holds up as well as the last, my next car will also be an Accord.I believe Elroy5\\'s experiences helps to explain the success of Honda and Toyota: happy owners become repeat customers. People who have bad experiences with any brand tend to shop elsewhere for their next car.We bought a loaded ($27,105 MSRP) 2007 AWD SEL Ford Fusion partially because of our generally good experiences with a 1997 Ford Thunderbird, 86,000 miles, and a 2000 Ford Focus station wagon, 93,000 miles. Neither was perfect (alternators, batteries, brakes, tires for each) but no major problems either.Favorable reviews in J.D. Power and Associates and Consumer Reports were additional factors as was having a genuinely good Ford, Lincoln Mercury dealer, Sherwood of Salisbury, Md.The clincher was the features, handling, looks of the Fusion. We\\'ve had it almost 10 months and 4,700 miles with zero problems so we are naturally happy customers/owners.We still own, and drive, the Thunderbird and the Focus. We are a three-Ford family.I believe the quality of all the mid-size sedans has improved tremendously over the last 10 years, probably because Honda and Toyota helped to raise the reliability bar a few notches. It is now an extremely competitive market segment. This is good for the consumers.  Agree that no vehicle is flawless. I\\'ve owned two new accords and replaced the transmission in each of them (from what I see on these threads, Honda has more transmission problems than any manufacturer); had a new Toyota Corolla - replaced clutch, pressure plate and throwout bearing and 5th gear synchronizer in first month of ownership (from what I read on these threads Toyota is \"king of recalls\"; two (new) diesel rabbits - no drivetrain problems (drove one for 308,000 miles), but cars both nickled and dimed me to death; a plymouth duster with 318 cu in - great car with lots of electrical problems; mazda cosmo - unsure as car was stolen after owning it for only about a month; Dodge Aires SE - problems are too numerous to even mention. So you basically pay your money and take your chances. Everyone makes good cars and everyone makes cars with problems.  I\\'ve owned two new accords and replaced the transmission in each of them (from what I see on these threads, Honda has more transmission problems than any manufacturer)I don\\'t agree that Honda has more tranny problems then any other mfg, however, my fathers 2004 Accord EX V6 coupe is now on tranny #2.....only 50K on it.  Most Honda\\'s are sold as 4 cylinders, by far, the vast majority are 4 bangers. The 4 bangers never have had, and never did have any tranny problems, therefore, the tranny problem in Honda\\'s was miniscule really, just for the V6 models.  I think it is close to 30% V6 based on the last thing I had heard. 30% of Honda Accord owners (not to mention Acura CL, Honda Odyssey, etc) having recalled transmissions isn\\'t all that miniscule to me.I have a friend whose CL tranny bit the dust at 85k miles or so. Locked into 2nd or 3rd gear and that was the end of that.It is/was a very real problem. TO call it miniscule is to be a bit naive, isn\\'t it?  Do we have an official/credible source on percentages somewhere?  Hopefully the V6 doesn\\'t still have tranny issues. Wasn\\'t that cured in the 2006 model year? Those V6 engines sound great, and go vrooooom, almost like having a V8. And they get around 29 MPG on the freeway, short of too much vroooooming. Loren  You should be able to do a lot better than 29 mpg on freeway in an Accord V6, and that will be pre-2008 Accord. Even my TL gets 32 mpg at about 72-73 mph (and considerably better at ~60 mph). At about 80 mph, it drops to 28-29 mpg. I won\\'t be surprised to see the new Accord V6 getting mid-30s at over 70 mph.  Even my TL gets 32 mpg at about 72-73 mph (and considerably better at ~60 mph).Wow, that is really good, my co-worker obtains 19 mpg in city and 27 mpg highway (70 mph) in his TL.  Well it is not always easy to lower speeds in California to 60, but it may be time to do another MPG test, as it seems to be broke in at 9,500 miles on her. Will let ya know next time I do a longer run. I may be able to top 29, but mid-30\\'s nahhh, I doubt it. Could find a road which is safe to do 55 MPH, and is really level, to do a mileage run, but who cares. The 29 MPG was traveling in the 65 to 80 MPH range most of the way, with some creeping on through a traffic accident area. Heck, maybe it gets 32 MPG??? Will see -- happy with 29 MPG compared to those with an SUV getting less than 19 MPG. L  My TL actually matches my 1998 Accord\\'s fuel economy in city and on highway. Both average around 26 mpg in mixed driving with half the distance averaging 65-70 mph. The other half is city driving. The trip computer in TL typically indicates an overall average speed of 36-38 mph. A massive traffic jam or two quickly drops the average speed, and mileage by 1-2 mpg.During one of my recent trips to Houston, I averaged 73 mph (with occasional 80+ mph stints) and got 31 mpg. This includes some city/slow highway driving in Houston and Dallas.As a matter of fact, this came to me as a surprise. Since my TL was rated 20/29 mpg (now it is rated 18/26), and I\\'m usually one of the faster guys on the road, my expectations were around 29-30 mpg. Then I had an opportunity to fill up and drive for a biton a 70 mph highway. As usual, my average speed was between 70-75 mph. And after a few miles on a slower highway (60-65 mph), it was a pleasant surprise to see trip computer indicating 32 mpg. I had a camera handy, so I decided to record it, and here it goes:I ended up driving about 101 miles that evening (about 60% freeway), and trip computer indicated 30 mpg. But this is more typical on per tank basis:The trip computer is fairly accurate.  Slow isn\\'t better. I\\'ve figured out that the best mileage is to be had around 50-60 mph. Any slower and mileage goes down. I decided to play with the TL one day and after refueling and resetting the trip computer, drove about 10 miles at 60-62 mph. The trip computer was showing 36 mpg and flirting with 37 mph, but dropped to 35 mpg by the time I got home (the last 3 miles were at 40-45 mph). I\\'m hoping to try this again over a long stretch but I\\'m not a driver with patience to cruise around at only 60-65 mph. :P Between 65-75 mph, I seem to get 32 mpg. Mileage seems to drop rather quickly after that, 28-29 mpg around 80 mph. That has made me wonder, what kind of mileage could VCM (as in 2008 Accord V6) get?  I wouldn\\'t trust the trip computers and fuel mileage computers at all. The only thing I trust is this..... If it takes me 10 gallons to fill it up, and it was full when I started, and I went 300 miles, then I got 30 MPG. That is the only relatively accurate way to figure true miles per gallon. Do it for each tank/fill-up.  I believe the quality of all the mid-size sedans has improved tremendously over the last 10 years, probably because Honda and Toyota helped to raise the reliability bar a few notches. It is now an extremely competitive market segment. This is good for the consumers.I couldn\\'t agree with this statement more. Both JD Powers and Consumer Reports have published data that the difference in reliability between the highest rated and the lowest rated cars in this segment over a five year period is around 1 extra problem where the best would have around 3 problems and the worst around 4 problems on average. Considering the complexity of cars these days and consumers increasingly demanding standards, it\\'s amazing to me how good most of these cars hold up. There are always exceptions to the rule of course and we all hope that we aren\\'t the owner of those bad exceptions! But all this data shows that cars in this class can be chosen based on features and characteristics that are important to the buyer. For me, I wanted something that could hold a lot of cargo (not only is this important for my job, but I have found this very handy for moving stuff) and wanted something very fun to drive. I wanted something that rated well in crash tests, had a manual transmission, and had over 200 hp. Luckily I wasn\\'t in a hurry to make a decision, so I bought around Thanksgiving and was able to save thousands of dollars. Almost 2 years later, I still get excited about road trips and find excuses to take my car out for a drive... my Mazda6 is by far the best car I\\'ve had a chance to spend a lot of time with. I\\'m sure I would have been happy with other cars in this class, but I\\'d have to make significant compromises on either handling or utility while also having to pay thousands more.  Now I will have to include the receipt in the picture. :P I do calculate manually as well. Based on my experience, trip computer seems to be accurate (in loaner TSX, rental Altima and my TL). The only way I can the get mileage in my Accord is to calculate.  Call me a pessimist, but I am still thinking the best reliable and long lasting, as in durable cars came out in the early years of the 90\\'s from Japan. Those more simple cars. As for the domestics, well yes indeed, the 2002 on are better. Now which is better long term is another story. In say the fourth, seventh or tenth year, which will still look good, drive well and be trouble free. Most bets are still on the Japan makes, as most retail customers of these mid-sized cars choose the Japan make first, then the domestic, Korean and all the rest. And yes, I can see how most will conclude that due to all the makes being screwed together better and using a lot of the same assembly techniques, most cars should be pretty close in initial quality. Only time will tell as to how the sum of the parts inside and engineering play out down the long road however. Considering all the complexity of the modern day car, it is truly a wonder how most do not have all sorts of strange things going on. Once again, the car with a gazillion air bags, stability control, electronic everything, and all that jazz is pretty new. Will any be trouble free and affordable to keep very long, is the question? Ya know a \\'65 Mustang is pretty simple and thus still on the road. L  While I don\\'t care much for JD Powers etc, but since you brought up the name, I decided to look at their IQS from 2006 for following cars ranked best to worst, averaging overall quality ratings (mechanical and design):1-Honda Accord: 4.751-Toyota Camry: 4.752-Ford Fusion: 4.252-Nissan Altima: 4.253-Chrysler 300: 3.753-Pontiac G6: 3.754-Chevrolet Impala: 3.255-Mazda6: 3.06-Dodge Stratus: 2.75As Mazda\\'s and Ford\\'s positions suggest, it doesn\\'t matter whether it is an American brand or Japanese, but on the overall picture, the prominent Japanese makes are still on top. How do they stack up in the long term? It should make for another interesting ranking.  I was able to achieve 100mpg in my 330. Going downhill with my foot off the gas was great on gas mileage. :shades The trip computer did register 34 mpg at about an even 70 mph. Stop and go killed the mileage though.  IQS says nothing about long term. It\\'s an indication of how the car comes off the assembly line.  Slow isn\\'t better.I concur. Getting to speed slowly and minimizing starts and stops is where you pick up mileage. There are lights on my commute that are timed to prevent you from making more than one light (so you have to stop for each one - even though they all turn green at the same time), so watching traffic try in vein flooring their poor little cars only to realize they are going to have to slam on their brakes as they miss the light just makes this sucking sound (I also think the county should have a class action lawsuit for making the road system as inefficient as possible, but that is another story). Anyway, by anticipating starts and stops well in advance, you can be a lot lighter on the gas, brake, and clutch, and the fuel economy goes up in spades. I got 37 mpg in the \\'07 Accord EX last tank, and that is an 80/20 mix.  I wasn\\'t able to find the same data you researched, but I did come across this PDF of the 2006 JD Powers IQS study. You forgot to include Hyundai in your list which actually was listed higher than either Honda or Toyota.http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/news/releases/pdf/2006082.pdfHowever, I do agree that IQS really doesn\\'t impact long-term reliability, etc.  Ford, GM or Chrysler had a mid-size that was the fastest from 0 to 60, stopped the fastest from 60 to 0, had the best city and highway gas mileage, was rated the top car by all of the car magazines, Consumer Reports and J.D. Power.Better still, this mythical car would sell for $20,000 and have V6 power and come equipped with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic.In short, this wonder car from Ford, GM or Chrysler would be head and shoulders above all competitors in the mid-size market regardless of the yardstick used.Would the wonder car outsell the Camry and Accord? I seriously doubt it. The Camry and Accord have a customer base that just won\\'t quit, legions of loyal owners. The wonder car would have to be on the market for five or 10 years before it would capture first place in sales.The mid-size sedan market is indeed competitive but still dominated by the Camcords. That situation is not likely to change, regardless of what the competitors produce.  I did look at Sonata, it would have placed below Accord and Camry in that list, but I was sticking with Japanese/US brands (you won\\'t see a German brand included either).  (you won\\'t see a German brand included either). I\\'d hope not, there are no German brands included in the thread. There are, however, Koreans.  They are a loyal base for good reasons. I wasn&#146;t a Honda guy but the Accord experience changed it all. Now, it is a tall order for any other brand to get my $$$. Is it a perfect car? I can see things Honda could (and should) have done differently or better. But as a package, it is a great car. I haven&#146;t seen the new Accord in person, yet, however.As a brand, Honda is seen as one of the best in quality not just here in America, but also in Europe. If you look at Top Gear&#146;s compilation of best to worst brands, Honda is at #3 behind Skoda and Lexus. But these studies and surveys aren&#146;t the reason for setting the benchmark, they backup personal experience. Outside of lifestyle buyers (who want to buy something unique/different for the sake of it), I can see why it would be a tall order to sway a lot of buyers. For that, GM, Ford and Chrysler will not only have to deliver cars like what you suggested, they will have to do it on a consistent basis for some time.The problem with these three is that they rely too much on flash, little on substance. They try to match or beat existing Toyota/Honda products, but with every redesign, they get left behind. The idea should be to set benchmark, than follow one. And it won&#146;t happen overnight. There was a time (1960s) when Chevrolet was selling Impala in numbers that combined sales of Accord and Camry (today) can&#146;t match. What happened? GM didn&#146;t keep up with the times. Accord, and then Camry, arrived. The rest is history.My car ownership history:1982 Celica Supra (bought used, served the purpose well)1988 Corolla GT-S (bought used, served the purpose very well)1992 Camry LE (bought used, had a few issues)In fall 1997, I was ready for my first new car. I liked older Camry but hated the way 1997 was designed. Taurus and it also were the rental queens, and after plenty of seat time, I figured out that I couldn&#146;t live with either of them. So, I didn&#146;t even test drive these two, but considered plenty of others (Altima, Maxima, Intrigue, Grand Prix and Passat). 1998 Accord emerged as the winner, partly based on reputation and rest on driving experience, as well as it meeting my needs and the budget. Cars since then,1999 Prelude2000 Civic2006 TL (shares time and garage with my 1998 Accord)So, I did give a chance to others. In case of Intrigue, it was supposed to be an extremely competitive product, and it was. But it didn&#146;t last. I travel and rent cars a lot. And after driving them all, I see no reason to get anything but another Accord. Although, the next Fit is a contender now, since I could use a frugal car with hatchback utility, with a sedan already in the garage.  You forgot one. Had a history of producing reliable cars and worked hard to earn their customers business. Yes, I would buy from that manufacturer.  I would consider Passat to be a contender in this thread. I loved it in 1997, and after observing quality issues am wary of owning one. But thats another story.  I would consider Passat to be a contender in this thread.I had it pegged as a solid Avalon/Maxima contender based on price and available features. The V6 model STARTS at over $30k. A model with dual climate control and leather will be in the $33k range.  V6 is unnecessary in Passat. It is very well equipped with a nice 200 HP engine for $24K. Thats right about the average transaction price of an average car in America, and can be had for less. If not for my observations in friends\\' cars, seeing how they have aged (especially the drive train), it will be a while before I show my faith in anything VW. Because the way I drive, it won\\'t take long to be out of warranty.Same with Accord. If I do go for one, it will be another EX-L for me (with NAV this time).  In a 3400 lb car, some people will deem a V6 necessary, regardless of how nice the 4 is. That\\'s why they offer one. Same is true in Camry, Accord, Fusion. I\\'ve got a 4-cyl Accord and it has plenty of power, and is smooth to boot. Other people will still want more of each.  My 1998 Accord is ~3200 lb, and going by current standards, it has only ~145 HP (150 HP by old standard) and a 4-speed automatic. But it drives like a more powerful car, loaded and is very smooth. I deemed the 200 HP V6 unnecessary ten years ago.The key to performance is in gearing and how it utilizes the power curve. Passat has both. While most people are fixated with 0-60 runs (which largely explains the quest for more and more power), for me it is all about rolling acceleration.  I agree, but the premium sedan customer will be a little different I believe. Some people buying a sedan won\\'t settle for a 4-cylinder for pure reasons of it not being \"the best.\" I have a 130 hp Accord and find it plenty for my needs. Not \\'fast\\' but adequate.See it here:http://youtube.com/watch?v=oqpmCiC_twg  That is the problem. A lot of people seem to buy based on nomenclature\\x85 &#147;So, it has got a V6 or a four banger?&#148; Two possible responses:&#147;It is a V6 sire&#148;\\x85 &#147;I will take it&#148;&#147;It is a four cylinder sire but see it performs like a V6&#148;\\x85 &#147;four banger, eh?&#148;I decided to look at C&D road test for Passat 2.0T and they have it for wagon (3492 lb). They did one for sedan but with the 280 HP/V6.&#147;Sixty mph arrives in 7.2 seconds. That&#146;s 1.3 seconds slower than the V-6 Passat sedan, but it&#146;s still quicker than a V-6 Ford Fusion.&#148;And it is not just 0-60 where it does well. Its 5-60 acceleration is impressive too, 7.7 seconds.I value 5-60 more (and other rolling start acceleration tests that virtually no American automotive pros seem to care about) since it is more telling of a drivetrain\\'s elasticity. Some European magazines will go as far as testing acceleration in different gears for same range of speeds (with manual transmission). We get 0-60 with high rpm clutch drop for armchair bragging rights.  Very true, and that was sort of my point in my previous post. Another reason is that some people don\\'t want to rev their engine beyond 3,000 RPM. Me? I\\'ll take it to 4k on a daily basis if I need or want to. In my youtube video, I am taking an interchange ramp (a 30 MPH ramp) and accelerating back to my cruising speed on the other interstate. I hit just under 4,000 RPM, but its no biggie in a Honda 4.  Interestingly enough, I rarely go past 3500 rpm in the Accord and still leave the rest of the traffic behind. I will get close to redline a few times everyday but only when merging on a freeway. This would be the time I look for maximum power and in most cases, 20 lb/HP ratio is plenty to have me ready to stomp on brakes by the end of it.That might also explain why I get similar mileage in Accord and TL. While the TL is 1.8 times as powerful, I\\'m probably using 80% of Accord\\'s potential, and only 50% of TL\\'s.  How much longer does Honda and Toyota get to skate by on their past before the realities of today start to be recognized?They just recalled the new Civic AGAIN - this time because a wheel could fall off. Camry and Accord have both had recent transmission problems including locking up at highway speeds. The Odyssey has been recalled at least 14 times. The brand new Toyota Tundra had catastrophic camshaft failures only months after launching.These things were unheard of a decade ago. I get that some of it is simply brand preference and I understand that - I have the same preferences for certain things. I just don\\'t understand how things like that can be ignored by so many people for so long.  These things were unheard of a decade ago. ... I just don\\'t understand how things like that can be ignored by so many people for so long.A mystery to be sure. The media would be all over these incidents like white on rice if the vehicles had Ford, General Motors or Chrysler written on them. Introduced in late 2005 as a 2006 model, the Ford Fusion has yet to have its first recall. Knock on wood.  It does not take much to leave the rest of traffic behind. When I can\\'t, because of too many cars in front of me, I\\'m running at around 2000 rpm accerating at the pathetically slow pace of traffic.  I will get close to redline a few times everyday but only when merging on a freeway. This would be the time I look for maximum power and in most cases, 20 lb/HP ratio is plenty to have me ready to stomp on brakes by the end of it. I\\'m like you, I don\\'t typically rev high except when merging, and even then, 4,500 or so is usually the top end of it. Also, my Accord in the youtube video I posted has a ratio of over 22 lbs per hp. The new Accord 4-cyl has a ratio near 17 lbs per hp, I believe.  Adequate is a good thing - excellent is a better thing. Just drive a V6 Accord and the i4 Accord on the same day. The sweet sound of a V6 at full throttle is pretty cool. A V6 or V8 is still very much my personal choice, unless I am looking more to save money, which I did for years in buying only i4 or fuel efficient v6 cars, or the car only came with a smaller engine. Price wise you save all the way around. Power wise, I like the smooth delivery of the V6 when compared to a noisier i4 with a turbo, which going to require that extra turbo boosting before delivery. To save on gas costs, when gas gets to be $5 per gallon, or to keep to a smaller engine, like a Saab, yeah a turbo would be good. And with a stick shift, most of the new i4 engines are adequate to downright quick these days. But better than a V6, well that is a stretch.I am sure most older people, like little ol\\' me, also equate the i4 in a domestic and a rough and rocky engine. It was only after Japans smoother and durable i4 engines in those little cars had come out, that people gave much consideration to an i4 engine. In domestics it was first a V8, then a compromise to get the V6 or inline 6. Of course, those which purchased say the slant 6 Valiant, may still be on their first engine.  I guess most older people now do accept the domestic i4 engine cars, but no where nearly as much as they value the Japan i4 engined cars. This dates back to the later 60\\'s. L  I guess most older people now do accept the domestic i4 engine carsYou ain\\'t kidding. Just yesterday I saw 2 Honda Civic coupes drove by senior citizens (at least 70 years old). I guess this is only in California, in Florida they\\'ll either be in a CV/GM, Buick or Avalon.  Typical Honda/Toyota dealer response to a problem:Dealer: \"Yes, there is a problem with your vehicle. We are happy to fix it for you entirely free of charge (usually with no hassle). Also, Honda/Toyota has extended your warranty coverage on the affected part(s).\"Typical Ford/GM/Chrsyler dealer response to a problem:Dealer: \"We could not find a problem with your vehicle.\" or \"Here is a band-aid for your vehicle.\"   ... my Accord in the youtube video I posted has a ratio of over 22 lbs per hp. The new Accord 4-cyl has a ratio near 17 lbs per hp, I believe.I am not familiar with the horsepower per pound statistic. I\\'m guessing that a lower number is better?  Yes. Just divide weight (2900 lbs) by horses (130) to get the figure. It means each horse has 22 lbs, in effect. Less weight = faster car.   That measurement is kind of useless. For example the 335 reaches 90% of torque(300) at 1400 rpms. This means 270 ft/lb torque are available at 1400 rpm to move the car forward. The weight to hp ratio means less on a 335 than on an S2000, which relies on high rpms to develop hp.  Your facts are true, but in this market, these sedans make most of their power usable. Variable Valve Timing (VTEC, VVTi, etc) has helped a lot of this. I\\'m not saying that number is the end-all figure or anything, but I wouldn\\'t call it useless either. Can we agree to disagree? It still gives you an idea of what to expect from a car. People touted the Ford Edge\\'s 260+ horses, but fail to mention that it weighs over 4,500 lbs (more than several 8 passenger vehicles I can think of). In return you get a car with decent acceleration, but not the rocket you\\'d think 260 horses would turn this midsize 5-passenger SUV into.  It isn&#146;t entirely useless. While measured at peak power, most engines have a linearly rising power curve. For that matter, if I see a car with 13.5 lb/HP, I can estimate it to run 0-60 in about 6 seconds.Where a car produces peak power doesn&#146;t matter, because power should be matched to wheel speed (not rpm) since it takes gearing into account.  Funny the Honda guys have ignored this but continue to on and on how a 4 cylinder Accord is the best thing since..well the best thing ever. Guess you will eventually get a reply (a negative one no doubt) when they quit exclaiming how good an engine that ole\\' Accord has.  Well, this Honda guy isn\\'t old enough to remember the past; I\\'ve only been driving since late 2002. And ya know what, I\\'ll say it too. In this class, the Accord has the best 4-cylinder to ME. I don\\'t know of any known problems stemming from this 2.4L. Can I not state this opinion without some major ridicule?I don\\'t think all \"Honda guys\" in this forum are created equal (we sure don\\'t post like it). Give some of us some credit. I\\'ve posted the good AND the bad, and even I get ridiculed from some fellow Honda owners when I say my two Accords have not been \"flawless.\"We\\'re not all burying our heads in the sand fellas!  I would have to consider myself an old fuddy duddy - almost 61 - but, I\\'ve been driving Inline 4\\'s for 40 years, as of next year. There are some mighty smooth I4 engines, albeit not many with birth origins in Detroit. As to the pros of a well-designed V6, yes, they are nice, powerful engines. But, if one is like me who keeps a car on average from 10 to 20 years, the maintenance differential between an I4 and a V6 is substantial, especially when it comes to out-of-warranty repair costs (either preventive or corrective). I used to turn wrenches for a living, and would much prefer working on a Inline engine over any V6, especially in the transverse configuration. Because of this, I opt for the Inline 4 every time.But, if you have the money and/or lease rather than buy and keep a car for only a few years, go for the V6.  Go ask the Toyota owners with sludged engines how they were treated and why they had to file (and win) a class action lawsuit against Toyota to get their engines replaced. There are good dealers and bad dealers for all makes. Stop perpetuating a false stereotype.  I disagree with your statement. An engine that develops peak torque at 1400 is going to have different characteristics than one that develops peak torque at 3500. Sure gearing is also different, but in general the former car is going to be faster to 60 than the latter car.Assuming apples to apples vehicle comparison. Not Tahoe vs S2000 for example.  Your facts are true, but in this market, these sedans make most of their power usable. Variable Valve Timing (VTEC, VVTi, etc) has helped a lot of this.Eh, what it did was allow for the motor to be tuned more for low end torque (and that is still very relative) and support the breathing requirements for high-rpm driving. Any low displacement mutli-valve motor likes being revved more than being lugged. If you look at something GMs 3.8 pushrod, that thing feels really quick from 0-40 or so, but it is pretty much all over by 4500-5000 rpm. The 4 valve/cylinder motors don\\'t even wake up until about 3500 rpm and they rock to about 7 or 8k.I don\\'t think I would want a vehicle bigger than the \\'07 Accord with a 4 cylinder. Its adequate in that car with a stick, but nothing earth shattering. The salesperson at the Saturn dealership pointed out that race cars have 4 cylinder motors, and then I pointed out how often the are rebuilt.  I don\\'t think I would want a vehicle bigger than the \\'07 Accord with a 4 cylinder. Its adequate in that car with a stick, but nothing earth shattering. I\\'d like to point out that in the last comparison I read including the Altima and Aura, that the 4-cylinder Altima was faster than the V6 Aura.We obviously have different ideas of \"adequate,\" and thats ok. Adequate would be my 130 hp Accord. It gets me where I need to go without being floored when merging on the interstate. My 2006 Accord 4-cyl is much quicker than that car.Then again, I\\'m not the average 20 year old . I\\'ve never had a ticket, never caused a wreck (been hit three times but never at fault) I\\'m more often in the middle or right lane as opposed to the left lane, and I don\\'t ever do much more than 8-10 MPH over the posted limit. Usually about 5 over.  So you _think_ GM dealers don\\'t fix problems? That\\'s an erroneous sterotype.But Let\\'s talk about HOnda and the transmission problems through the decades. Would you rather be one of the people for whom they graciously replace a transmission with the same, flawed transmission at 40K and then at 75K and extend the warranty to 100K. But wait a minute: the Honda is touted by some as a 250K mile car with no problem. SO now you\\'re stuck with a flawed transmission design but your warranty is gone at 100K so the next replacements are on you.Or do you want to talk about the people in Edmund\\'s discussions reporting about delay, lag, flare, in their now Camry transmission and the dealers act like they\\'re never heard the complaint before and the owner just needs to adjust to the car\\'s driving style, or the car has to learn the customer\\'s style, etc. The thread has gone through Toyota lexus models, and the Avalon, and now the Camry.Yup that\\'s customer service. Let\\'s get real. A couple of proHonda posters in one thread stated that even their cars, with which they are very satisfied, have had problems. All cars have some problems. Some are mitigated by what the dealer or company does for the problem. But please don\\'t try the stereotype misconception.And the topic is features of the cars and practical comparisons not the stereotypes from the past and present.  Of course the characteristics will be different. This is why power/weight ratio is more about getting an estimate as opposed to real number. There are way too many variables involved. It ultimately comes down to average power during a run. If one knew that, THAT could be used to calculate power/weight ratio. Apparently, 0-60 is also affected by drivetrain layout too.Everything else being identical, mid-engine is supposed to be better than FR is supposed to be better than FF. But that doesn\\'t make the power/weight ratio useless just less accurate (and accuracy isn\\'t the idea behind it).As for high rpm versus low rpm, most people do think in terms of rpm versus HP as opposed to speed versus HP. 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 mph don\\'t happen at the same rpm in every car. In my Accord, 38 mph happens at 5300 rpm, while in an S2000, it happens at 8000 rpm. What does it mean? S2000 is geared 50% shorter than my Accord. The Accord isn\\'t getting to 5300 rpm sooner than S2000 gets to 8000 rpm.That is why it is better to relate power to speed (as opposed to rpm).  How much longer does Honda and Toyota get to skate by on their past before the realities of today start to be recognized? They just recalled the new Civic AGAIN - this time because a wheel could fall off. Camry and Accord have both had recent transmission problems including locking up at highway speeds. The Odyssey has been recalled at least 14 times. The brand new Toyota Tundra had catastrophic camshaft failures only months after launching. So what are you saying here? I should stop buying Accords, because someone else had transmission problems. I have been driving Automatic Accords for 16 years, and they haven\\'t missed a beat. If I, or many other Accord owners had transmission problems, and were treated unfairly by Honda, do you think we would just keep buying them anyway. I know I wouldn\\'t, and don\\'t think many others would either. If there are hundreds of thousands of Honda and Toyota owners having problems and being treated unfairly, they would not continue to sell at the rate they do. The number of disgruntled owners must be much lower than you seem to imply. If a problem/recall is fixed in short order, to the satisfaction of the owner, it\\'s no big deal.  What does it mean? It means it\\'s an apples to oranges comparison.  They are both fruits, so something is in common there.   \"That is the problem. A lot of people seem to buy based on nomenclature\\x85 &#147;So, it has got a V6 or a four banger?&#148; Two possible responses: &#147;It is a V6 sire&#148;\\x85 &#147;I will take it&#148; &#147;It is a four cylinder sire but see it performs like a V6&#148;\\x85 &#147;four banger, eh?&#148; Try substituting \"Honda\" for V6 and \"Hyundai\" for four banger. You will see why some people prefer Sonata compared to Accord and vice versa.  We agree on this weight to HP ration. For 30 years or so the Insurance Services Office, as a guide to most insurance companies, rated cars as standard performance, intermediate performance and high performance, and surcharged intermediate & high performance cars.The difference in rating the cars was the weigth to horsepower ration. I forget where the lines were drawn from one category to the next. There was also a \"sports car category\" that considered wt/hp, wheel base and said sports cars were imported cars. But, that\\'s a whole different discussion.Wt/HP does make a big difference in acceleration whether from a standing start or not.  Would the wonder car outsell the Camry and Accord? I seriously doubt it.I don\\'t. I think such a car--which you described as being \"head and shoulders above all competitors in the mid-sized market regardless of the yardstick used\"--would sell in huge volumes, if manufacturing capacity were no problem (and it is now, with the plant closing in recent years). I think U.S. car buyers are hungry for a domestic car that can go toe-to-toe with the best in the mid-sized class. Remember when the Taurus was the #1 selling car in the U.S.? Since then, the Taurus and other American mid-sizers have slipped vs. the competition, but they are coming back. The Fusion and Milan are solid entries, as is the Aura. The Malibu looks on paper and in photos to be competitive, and has the same platform as the Aura.I think an American mid-sized car that matches your description would easily outsell Accord and Camry. Actually, I don\\'t think that car would need to be as great as you described to beat Accord and Camry in sales. For example, I don\\'t think it would take huge leaps for the Fusion/Milan and Aura to meet and even beat Accord and Camry overall. If you look at reviews of the Aura, it\\'s mostly little quibbles that kept it out of first in the comparos. And put a nicer interior and Ford\\'s best engines into the Fusion/Milan, and it\\'s a winner over Camry and on par with or even better than Accord. Then it\\'s just a matter of getting the word out to the buying public: \"American mid-sized cars: we\\'re ba-aaaack!\"  A must read about the so-called sludge problem is in \"Toyota Camry: Problems & Solutions - READ ONLY\" message #4829 by Hylyner. Please check it out.New Accord looks nice, Camry is too, and the Fusion is also nice. Just depends on preferences, there is no real right answer for all.  If I, or many other Accord owners had transmission problems, and were treated unfairly by Honda, do you think we would just keep buying them anywayYou\\'re missing the point elroy. I\\'m only making a counterpoint to you and the others here who keep putting Toyota and Honda up on a pedestal and saying that they\\'re perfect.They\\'re not perfect and in some cases they\\'re worse than other brands (lately). If you can\\'t see that then you don\\'t want to see it.  \"Typical Honda/Toyota dealer response to a problem: Dealer: \"Yes, there is a problem with your vehicle. We are happy to fix it for you entirely free of charge (usually with no hassle). Also, Honda/Toyota has extended your warranty coverage on the affected part(s).\" \"Just had a auto tranny replaced at 43,000 miles in a Toyota. It was free of charge but they did not extend my warranty beyond the original 5yr/60,000. I have about 1 year or 17,000 warranty on this new tranny. Keeping my fingers crossed.  You\\'re missing the point elroy. I\\'m only making a counterpoint to you and the others here who keep putting Toyota and Honda up on a pedestal and saying that they\\'re perfect. No, Honda and Toyota are not perfect. But if the problems were as widespread as you imply they are, people would not still be buying them. I bought my second Accord, because of prior experience with the first, which I assume other repeat Honda and Toyota customers have also. Problems with other brands are what made the Accord and Camry best sellers. So isn\\'t it safe to assume that if the Accord and Camry were really having widespread problems, the sales numbers would go down? I have been reading the 2003-2007 problems and solutions board for a few years now, and there are only two people I can remember having transmission problems. If one transmission in 5000 goes out, I\\'ll take those odds. Like you say, no car is perfect. A recall is not death sentence, contrary to what you would have us believe.  > I think you have an unfair opinion of most of the workers in the USA. Most of the time they carry a lot of poor performing management. Please tell me what caused the failure or what happened, and tell us what model?  You missed my point. I am not saying the 4 cyl Honda engine is anything...good or bad or indifferent. What I pointed out is the poster stated..\"hey has anybody noticed Honda and Toyota seem to be having more quality problems lately\". And, that this wouldn\\'t have been the case 10 years ago. I said in turn that everyone was so wrapped up comparing notes about how good their 4 cylinder Honda is they didn\\'t have time to post the expected denials.  So isn\\'t it safe to assume that if the Accord and Camry were really having widespread problems, the sales numbers would go down?Nobody said they were having \"widespread problems\". Why does everything have to be black or white with you? I just said they\\'re not perfect - I didn\\'t say they were bad.  Actually, the sales numbers for the Accord have gone down in recent times (even with larger incentives), although they are still very strong in this class. I think that\\'s a sign that Honda\\'s brand loyalty is so strong that it forgives some missteps, even biggies like the auto tranny problem.  And in case you were wondering, the Mazda6 is still King of the Bongo! Vid of new Mazda6Nice evolution from the current design... still sleek and muscular but more chiseled. I\\'d have to agree with my uncle (a lexus ls430 and RV driver) who thinks Mazda has the best design theme for their cars right now of all the non-exotics.  True. Every brand has loyalists who will continue to buy no matter what. I also think Camry has had to increase incentives and fleet sales to maintain their sales lead.The real test will be when the 09 Fusion comes out. That\\'s when you\\'ll start getting repeat buyers and leasors. Right now every Fusion sale is a new customer. I bet at least 50% of Camcord sales are to previous owners.You also have a much improved Kia lineup and a new Mazda6 coming out next year. Should be interesting.  So it\\'s bad to be a repeat Accord customer, but good to be a repeat Fusion customer?  Time for a reality check...nobody said that the problems the Accord has is widespread(except for their longish-for-this-segment braking from 60-0 for the pre-08 models). People are just saying that Honda has had probs just like everyone else ... case in point, look at the Civic recall that just happened. No it\\'s not a death sentence (no need to get overly dramatic), but it shows that they aren\\'t perfect either. In fact JD Powers and Consumer Reports show that the Honda has on average about 3 probs per vehicle over a 5 year period. Yes this is better than average which is around 4 problems per vehicle, but it\\'s not lightyears ahead of other cars in this class. And personally, if I have to take an extra day without my car out of 1800 days (five years) with my free loaner from Mazda as part of my warranty, that\\'s ok with me if I get a car that looks better, drives better, brakes better, and has more cargo carrying ability while costing thousands less. But some people will like the Accord\\'s softer ride, a more stately interior, more comfy seats, or larger interior. But the difference in reliabilty wasn\\'t significant enough for me to make a decision based on it if I use data coming from both consumer reports and jd powers.  Many of you are reacting to things that are not being said! Let\\'s calm down, think about what you are reading and quit shooting from the hip - we\\'ll have a lot better conversation that way.  How realistic are these figures? Are they for a short hwy trip, or are they for a long distances including several tanks full? To really compare/know mileages it is nice to know, i.e. over 1000mi I averaged x mpg, not the I put in gas and went 100mi,or less and averaged xx mpg. I am certain that every vehicle here could \"average\" over 30mpg if trips were less than 50 miles, downhill, with tail winds, no loads, etc. You get the idea. Average mpg should be looked at realistically over the course of several tanks. If that is the case, then where are all of these great mpg figures? I personally don\\'t think many of these vehicles AVERAGE mid 30\\'s mpg, even hwy. Sorry, I just don\\'t believe most of these figures. I am thinking of 6cyl, not 4\\'s. van :confuse:  So it\\'s bad to be a repeat Accord customer, but good to be a repeat Fusion customer?I didn\\'t read any \"good\" or \"bad\" inferences in Allen Kirby\\'s post, merely that many Camcord sales are based on satisfied repeat customers. Satisfied previous customers are not possible with the Fusion because 2006 was the first model year. However, the 2009 Fusion may well entice satisfied owners to purchase a newer version.Satisfied customers are a good thing for all manufacturers and certainly do help explain the high sales totals for Camry and Accord, which are fine automobiles, generally.Many, many diverse factors are involved in the car-buying-decision process. I prefer the styling of the Fusion to everything else in the mid-size sedan segment and believe it has just as many creature comforts. The Ford, Lincoln, Mercury dealer in our city, Sherwood of Salisbury, Md., is aces in my book. That was another positive factor in the Fusion\\'s favor.If FoMoCo continues to improve the Fusion, Milan and MKZ, then it stands to reason that satisfied owners are likely to become repeat customers, thereby boosting sales. Ford is in the unenviable position of having to \"win back\" some customers. The Fusion trio is likely to do just that. These are fine automobiles, in my book, and extremely competitive with everything in their class.  I didn\\'t read any \"good\" or \"bad\" inferences in Allen Kirby\\'s post, merely that many Camcord sales are based on satisfied repeat customers. Satisfied previous customers are not possible with the Fusion because 2006 was the first model year. However, the 2009 Fusion may well entice satisfied owners to purchase a newer version.Exactly! I guess it\\'s hard to read and comprehend some things when you\\'re wearing blinders.  That\\'s why I emphasised \"Typical response,\" meaning there are exceptions. Of course the dealer plays a big part, but certainly not the biggest.On my last domestic I had three separate examples of the manufacturer not wanting to admit to a major problem. (Transmission troubles, rear diff troubles, engine cranking troubles).That\\'s where I\\'m coming from. I had a great dealer, but they can only be as good as the manufacturer. They just don\\'t have enough money to keep fixing customers cars when the manufacturer won\\'t stand behind.And in my recent experience, and the recent experiences of my extended family members in different parts of the state, there is a major difference between the various manufacturers.  Okay, that is your and your family\\'s experience. There\\'s no reason to extrapolate that to becoming everyone\\'s experiences.Let\\'s talk about the cars themselves, okay?  I agree. After every service, I have received survey forms. The sales person and the dealership seem to care about it a lot and will give me a courtesy call without fail to fill it up (as nicely as I can) because, apparently, Honda takes it seriously. I haven&#146;t been disappointed at all, so it didn&#146;t matter to me.OTOH, I have been reading about a guy who has had a tough time with a dealership. He mailed the survey form to Honda stating his experience (which was not good). A few days later, the dealership was telling him that he should not have done that. So, this guy&#146;s voice made it to Honda and they took it seriously, and contacted the dealership.  Just had a auto tranny replaced at 43,000 miles in a Toyota. It was free of charge but they did not extend my warranty beyond the original 5yr/60,000. I have about 1 year or 17,000 warranty on this new tranny. Keeping my fingers crossed. It does not make sense to me why Toyota won\\'t offer you the same warranty. A friend of mine with his Honda had transmission trouble a few years ago, and he got brand new warranty on it (back then it was 3 years/36K miles).  And the same thing happened with me and my Fusion.While some mfrs and dealers may be better than others you simply can\\'t say one does this and the others don\\'t just because of YOUR experience.  It was a Tundra and it wouldn\\'t shift out of first gear. There was absolutely no hints before it happened that there was anything wrong. In fact, I had just got through mentioning to the person that was with me that it had been virtually trouble free for four years. Anyway, took it in the next morning and they called two hours later and said it needed a new tranny. No cost like I said and they gave me a brand new Camry to drive for a week. I wasn\\'t complaining about the service, just responding to your statement that Honda and Toyota would automatically extend the warranty on an item like this and it wasn\\'t the case in my experieince.  It will..... as you say, trump the Camcords in about 5 to 10 years once the \"wonder domestic\" car proves it\\'s own wonderousness by lasting 5 to 10 years. More than likely this wonder car will turn into a rotten mess as it ages..... but yes, a wonder car that is class leading by every measure would outsell the Camcords in 5 to 10 years time, if it proved to be as reliable.  The two cars in my garage (1998 Honda Accord and 2006 Acura TL) have a combined 211K miles on them. Virtually every gas tank has been scrutinized. Here is how it goes.Fill up tankReset Trip ComputerDrive until the low-fuel warning is onRefuel and calculateIn case of TL, I also compare it indicated average mpg in the trip computer. I&#146;m surprised that people find getting 25-26 mpg (in mixed driving) in a V6 sedan to be unrealistic. One guy simply won&#146;t believe that TL would get any better than 29 mpg on highway but that I was getting 32 mpg at over 70 mph. The only way I could prove it over the internet was via pictures, with an open invitation to see it happening in person. If not for a daily occurrence that is traffic jams (on the way in and back to work), my cars might actually do a little better. I don&#146;t remember having posted this, but the longest no (gas) stop trip I have taken was in my Accord from Dallas to Memphis (507 miles driven). The distance was covered in 6 hours and 45 minutes, including a 5-7 minute rest area stop. I refueled next morning with 15.8 gallons, and that computed to 32 mpg, probably the best mileage I have seen in any car with a very high average speed.Coincidentally, the best I have done in the (lot more powerful) TL is 72.5 mph and 32 mpg over a distance of about 270 miles from Houston to Dallas. The car actually averaged 29 mpg over 695 miles which includes 80-85% highway driving, rest city.If my cars can get low 30s at speeds that I drive in, getting mid-30s might be possible in the new Accord (both, I-4 and V6), but I won&#146;t know for sure until having tried it myself.PS. I just remembered having posted this log couple of weeks ago from my last two road trips in fuel economy thread.  These things were unheard of a decade ago. I get that some of it is simply brand preference and I understand that - I have the same preferences for certain things. I just don\\'t understand how things like that can be ignored by so many people for so long. Perhaps they are ignored because it hasn\\'t happend to their Accord or Civic yet. In fact, not only has it not happened to hardly anyone\\'s own vehicle, but I\\'ve never seen a wheel fall off a Civic, anywhere, at anytime, in my entire life!Your making a mountain out of a mole hill.  If my cars can get low 30s at speeds that I drive in, getting mid-30s might be possible in the new Accord (both, I-4 and V6), but I won&#146;t know for sure until having tried it myself. Being that it will only achieve it\\'s advertised 29 mpg using the VCM programming, you had better plan on proving mid-30s on some flat land. Add hills and you\\'ll be in V6 mode a lot I\\'d wager. Seeing if Honda found a way around that is what I think is yet to be seen.  I don\\'t think all \"Honda guys\" in this forum are created equal (we sure don\\'t post like it). Give some of us some credit. I\\'ve posted the good AND the bad, and even I get ridiculed from some fellow Honda owners when I say my two Accords have not been \"flawless.\" Just for the record I was not one to ridicule you for calling your Honda\\'s less than flawless. I was just curious in asking you what you found to be the flaws with them... I figured they\\'d be minor, or else you wouldn\\'t be a so-called \"Honda\" guy.  Then you got cheated! You need to go back to your Toyota dealer and demand a 3/36K tranny warranty (as a minimum) from the date of install.  Well I\\'ve never actually seen the grand canyon in person, either, but I\\'m pretty sure it exists.The NHTSA doesn\\'t issue recalls for non-existent problems.  Well... This Honda owner had their tranny replaced after the warranty expired free of charge, and the warranty was extended 3/36K from the date of install. If they had not done both of those things free of charge, I\\'d be blasting Honda almost as bad as I do Chrysler. Also, Honda gave me a free rental car while I was getting my tranny replaced. I don\\'t see too many people forgiving a bad tranny unless the manufacturer stands behind it; Honda did, Dodge didn\\'t.It was night and day, black and white.  More than likely this wonder car will turn into a rotten mess as it agesPlease stop making these ridiculous statements. They\\'re not true.  I was just pointing out that the problem is obviously more of an isolated incident that lawyers have convinced Honda to get scared about so you have a recall....  So you have proof that cars made today or in recent years won\\'t rot as they age (over 5 years).Can I borrow your crystal ball?  Our 2007 SEL AWD Ford Fusion has a six-way power seat for the driver and a manual seat for the passenger. Are there any mid-price, mid-size sedans in this segment that have power assist for both seats? What about eight-way, 10-way power seats? Memory seats are only available in the luxury models, right?  The new EPA ratings don\\'t make sense to me at all. The old was easy to meet or beat.1998 Honda Accord EX-L/AT (Overall Mileage Ratings)Old EPA: 26 mpg (City/Hwy: 23/30)New EPA: 23 mpg (City/Hwy: 20/27)My Experience: 26 mpg (32-33 mpg at over 70 mph)2006 Acura TL/AT (Overall Mileage Ratings)Old EPA: 24 mpg (City/Hwy: 20/29)New EPA: 21 mpg (City/Hwy: 18/26)My Experience: 25-26 mpg (32 mpg at over 70 mph)So these cars do way better than EPA rating on highway. In fact, it is easy to get EPA\\'s new highway rating with 50% city driving thrown in! As a matter of fact, my 1998 Accord has NEVER done worse than 23 mpg on a tank (and that happened when I lived only 2 miles from work). But the new EPA rating says 20 mpg.If the trend stays, the new Accord V6 might actually get 27-28 mpg in mixed driving with highway mileage in mid 30s. If it were rated using old standard, the EPA rating would be 22/32 mpg (-1 mpg compared to my 1998 Accord in city and +2 mpg compared to my Accord on highway).As for hills etc, the second generation VCM should do better since now it won\\'t rely on I-3 mode as much (which is likely to be used primarily for low speed cruising around town). V4 is probably going to be the norm, unless driver demands power. So, fuel economy should be more like an I-4.Honda has now replaced the VCM in 2008 Odyssey with this new version. The old system engaged less since I-3 was often less capable to motivate a 4600 lb vehicle. V4 should have less trouble.  Well I\\'ve never actually seen the grand canyon in person, either, but I\\'m pretty sure it existsI\\'ve never seen Grand Canyon myself either but based on the people who\\'ve actually seen it, 90% said it\\'s great and 10% said it\\'s not worth the hype.Based on that until I\\'ve seen it myself I\\'ll tend to believe the \"perception\" which has the 90% to back it up.  That\\'s great that Honda replaced the defective Accord trannies free of charge, but... what is exceptional about that? The recall was issued well within the Accord\\'s powertrain warranty period. It was done under a NHTSA recall. In both circumstances, it would be unthinkable for the automaker--Honda or anyone else--to charge for fixing the problem.  So you have proof that cars made today or in recent years won\\'t rot as they age (over 5 years). I\\'ve driven the following vehicles:1990 ranger - 5 years1995 ranger - 5 years2000 Lincoln LS - 6 years1999 Expedition - 5 yearsNone of those vehicles had any out of warranty repair costs (and I drove them at least 2 years past the warranty). The day they were traded in there were no shakes or rattles. Nothing was broken or worn out or faded or cracked. You\\'re basing your opinions on 10-20 year old vehicles - that simply isn\\'t the case anymore.  And the same thing happened with me and my Fusion. So your tranny died in your wonderful Fusion?I\\'m curious to hear about this story? After warranty? And they stepped up?  If you\\'re betting on a football game, do you bet on the team that won the super bowl last year but is 5-5 this year or do you go with the team that finished 8-8 last year but is 10-0 this year? At what point does current performance outweigh past performance?  Look, a Honda and Toyota is barely broken in at 5 or 6 years old!!!!How many miles did you drive in those 5 to 6 years? I am talking about how a car operate in years 6-10. Those are the critical years, as every car will begin to have problems, but it is the amount/quantity and severity of those problems that counts!Some cars rot and fall apart, literally. You repair one thing, and then another, and then another, and then another.Some get a couple minor repairs and are well on their way to 200K miles with them, before they will need more repairs again.  If I am betting on a football game I\\'ll bet on teams that almost guaranteed that it\\'ll make the playoff.Let\\'s go a step further, if you are betting on college football, would you bet on traditional SEC, Big 10 powerhouses and USC or Fresno State and Louisville?Let\\'s talk pre-season because that\\'s more like buying a new car.  Well.... depends if that 5-5 team is made up of all-star veterans that are the same \"players\" as years before. Also, is that 10-0 team still the same players from years before, or did they recruit and entirely different team? All rookies?? Watch out!I\\'d take a \\'dream team of aging veterans\" any day over a team of outstanding rookies when it comes to playoff time. Playoff time is what counts, regular season is meaningless (except to get you into the playoffs or other home field advantages and seating position)That\\'s why The Chicago Bulls won not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, but 6 Championships with MJ and SP.It\\'s why the Patriots tore the shreds out of the Chargers last year in the playoffs, even though the Chargers were 14-2 and New England had a mediocre regular season.Honda looks to be like the Patriots right now, and Toyota perhaps is Indianapolis. The Chargers are off to a slow start this year... maybe they are Saturn....    Honda performed the so-called \"recall\" fix on my vehicle at about 32K miles. At 42K miles the tranny started to exhibit signs of problems. And they replaced it at that time; free of charge. The recall may have had something to do with the problem, or may not have had anything to do with it.... who knows..The dealer did \"claim\" my tranny looked as good as new when they took photographs of it at 32K....  Falcons are like Mitsubishi - fading fast... :sick: Bears are like Hyundai - good for a while then flat.49s are like Ford/GM/Chevy - good, then horrible then up and coming.  Honda looks to be like the Patriots right nowWell, they are arrogant - I\\'ll give them that one. But I didn\\'t think Honda was stealing Toyota\\'s product plans with a video camera.  If I had said I drove a Ford for 10 years with no problems you\\'d say they fall apart after 11 years.I hope Honda and Toyota don\\'t think the domestics are a threat. It will make it that much easier to surpass them.  \"If I, or many other Accord owners had transmission problems, and were treated unfairly by Honda, do you think we would just keep buying them anyway.\"Ummm yes. Just as many people bought American makes 1-2-3 times and got burnt each time. They are better though, and truth in point is that my buddy\\'s broke down tranny accord sits as he waits for his 08 to be delivered...  If I had said I drove a Ford for 10 years with no problems you\\'d say they fall apart after 11 years. No, actually, I\\'d never say that. I think 10 years with 200K is a reasonable lifetime for a quality automobile. After that point, the rest is gravy and a bonus. One of the main reasons people don\\'t keep their vehicles 10 years usually is probably because domestics don\\'t last that long.  I hope Honda and Toyota don\\'t think the domestics are a threat. It will make it that much easier to surpass them.I don\\'t believe that will be the case. I have seen more TV ads for Toyota and Honda in the last month than the total for the previous nine months or so. The Honda Accord ads are almost as numerous as the Toyota Tundra ads.  Haha, I knew someone would bring up the Camera cheating with the Patriots. Perhaps others have done the same thing and not been caught yet?I suppose stealing Toyota\\'s product plans would be a \"competitive advantage.\"I don\\'t think Honda is arrogant however.... they just know they got a good thing going.  A squabble fest this does not need to be!!Either post about the specifics of the vehicles in this segment and knock off the chest-beating or go find some other boxing arena. Please!  No, actually, I\\'d never say that. I think 10 years with 200K is a reasonable lifetime for a quality automobile. After that point, the rest is gravy and a bonus.One of the main reasons people don\\'t keep their vehicles 10 years usually is probably because domestics don\\'t last that long.I\\'ve never owned an automobile that had 100,000 miles on the odometer, let alone 200,000. My wife and I are, however, a three-Ford family. In addition to our 2007 SEL AWD Fusion, we own and drive a 1997 Ford Thunderbird, 86,000 miles, and a 2000 Ford Focus station wagon, 94,000 miles.Our generally good experience with these two Ford products was a factor in our decision to buy a Fusion, as opposed to an Accord or Camry. Hopefully, the Fusion will serve us as well as the T-Bird and Focus. We have, in the past, also owned three Mazda products and they were fine, too.  I think the median age of an average car on the road is now 8-9 years. But that doesn&#146;t talk about miles. I have seen older cars than my now ten year old Accord but with about half the miles on them. I do drive a lot though. My 2006 TL is flirting with 30K mile mark already, while the Accord is at 182K. If I ignore couple of my other cars as well as all rentals, I have averaged over 21K miles/year over last ten years and this may have to do with the choice to live in an exceptionally large metro area (Dallas-Ft Worth) where 15-20 miles is kinda \"in my neighborhood\".Besides the Accord, two of my other cars were well above 100K mark. The last I heard of my 1988 Corolla GT-S, it had 168K miles on the odometer and that was about 6-7 years ago (I had bought it with about 87K miles and sold it with a virtually flawless 138K miles). Interestingly enough, the only car that I didn&#146;t drive into that mark was the only one that gave me some trouble (1992 Camry). The GT-S replaced it.At this point, I can&#146;t imagine cars with major trouble spots at less than 100K miles. And I&#146;m not talking recalls as I would rather have that than have nagging issues that make me pay for repairs, the kind of story two of my VW owning buddies have had to share over last year.  we own and drive a 1997 Ford ThunderbirdBe careful, Boz! That 10 year old Ford is rotting to pieces and will fall apart any day now. :blush:  We averaged just under 23 mpg during a 1300+ mile trip in our V6 Explorer which is rated at 13 city and 19 highway under the new standard. If you read the fine print you\\'ll see that they also provide a range for the city and highway estimates. So basically those two big bold numbers you see on the window stickers are actually averages too. It\\'s not hard to increase your gas mileage when you do a lot of highway driving IMO. I always compensate for weight by adding a pound or two of air to the tires and limit drag by not putting things on the roof if I can avoid it.  I wasn\\'t naming names either. Just making a point that some of us seem more realistic, and some of us are more optimistic. I, for one, have found flaws in several Honda vehicles (my aunt\\'s 2005 is a great vehicle to drive, for a van, but it has been very problematic. So much so, that they can\\'t fix all of them (whistling windshield)). But I think all vehicles can be problematic in some instances. Honda isn\\'t as immune from problems as you (among others) tend to imply around here.  Being as he is averaging less than 9K miles a year in that Thunderbird, I suppose that\\'s the ONE way to get a Ford to last 10 years! :P He should be careful with all of his vehicles approaching 100K miles (other than his Fusion).Let\\'s see what the next 50K brings for him.  If you read the fine print you\\'ll see that they also provide a range for the city and highway estimates.Yes they do, and they have made me think... why do they bother sticking with one number then? They should just provide a range, and be done with it.  \"I am talking about how a car operate in years 6-10. Those are the critical years, as every car will begin to have problems, but it is the amount/quantity and severity of those problems that counts!\"Six to ten years with the cars of today is nothing. Practically all cars with proper preventive maintenance will easily go ten plus years and 150K miles without any major problems. Now, the real test of a car\\'s long-term reliability and quality is 20+ years. Check back then, and let me know how it\\'s doing.Each car I\\'ve owned for 10 to 20 years didn\\'t begin to show any significant problems until about the 12 to 14 year mark. I have a 22 year old daily driver that still hasn\\'t required any mechanical powertrain work, except for a clutch replacement at around the 170K mile level, and that was 9 years ago.The least amount of time I\\'ve ever kept a car is 12 years.  The MPG estimates (city & highway) apply to the vehicle to which the sticker is affixed. The range IIRC, applies to vehicles of a similar size, regardless of engine size in those other vehicles. Just saw a Maseratti today at a restaurant. Not too many parking spaces away was a Miata. Isn\\'t kind of \"government mentality\" to compare these two cars of similar size in the same range comparison for MPG?  Not quite. 6-10 year makes more sense because cars generally get out of their warranty period around that time, and people don\\'t buy cars to hold on to for 20+ years.And no, there are cars that are trouble prone well before they see 150K miles (if they ever see that).  When I\\'m looking at my mpg, I am really looking at what my vehicle gets. I don\\'t care about what other vehicles in the class are rated at. Now, if I were driving any of those vehicles, I certainly would expect to meet or beat their EPA ratings.And speaking of class, I think it is done by weight not by size. So, a 4000 lb compact car won\\'t be in the same class as a 2500 lb compact.  I was just replying to your post # 6034 and wasn\\'t questioning your actual MPG...I generally do better than the EPA estimate even though I drive less than 3 miles to work and most all of my driving is under 5 miles from destination to destination.I\\'m pretty sure, will have to check at my office Monday (if I remember), that the range shown on the sticker is based upon EPA size definitions, not weight of the car.  I found it on EPA\\'s website. For cars it is by EPA size class and for light trucks it is by weight. (link)  One of the main reasons people don\\'t keep their vehicles 10 years usually is probably because domestics don\\'t last that long. The first car I remember my parents owning was a Ford Torino, I don\\'t know the year. Next was a \\'78 LTD II, next an \\'87 Taurus, next a \\'96 Sable, and now an \\'06 Zephyr. A \\'91 Escort was in there too as a second car (replaced with a Hyundai Accent in 2004). None had high mileage but all were pushing 100k miles. The only problem any of them had was the \\'96 Sable. The power antenna broke after about 5 or 6 years and after roughly 8 years my dad had to have a CO2 sensor replaced. That\\'s it. No other problems. Note that some of them lasted more than 10 years. For all we know all of them are still on the road as all were traded or sold in very good condition.  Yes they do, and they have made me think... why do they bother sticking with one number then? They should just provide a range, and be done with it. Agreed. When you really take a hard look and figure out their methods, getting more than their posted numbers isn\\'t all that impressive. Mainly because they state that it is possible.  Test  Accord EX-LV6 has 4-way power seat for passenger side. And, all Accord trims (except LX) have 8-way power seat. In addition, power lumbar support is standard in all but LX and LX-P trims.  Accord EX-LV6 has 4-way power seat for passenger side. And, all Accord trims (except LX) have 8-way power seat. In addition, power lumbar support is standard in all but LX and LX-P trims.Enlightening, Robert. Thanx. The lumbar support and the seat back position adjustments are manual on the driver\\'s seat on our 2007 SEL Fusion and the passenger seat is totally manual. Advantage Accord.Convenient seat adjustment is an item of interest because my wife and I both drive the car and use differing positions. Of course, luxury mid-size sedans have memory seating, which would be ideal in our case.  \"Okay, that is your and your family\\'s experience. Let\\'s talk about the cars themselves, okay?\"This is going to be a very, very boring discussion if we can\\'t talk about our experiences as related to cars. Whats left? Stats? Photos? Who has the nicest brochure?  Has the highest rating of the cars listed at the top of this forum from Edmund users, with over 20 ratings being the minimum for my standards....  I can understand the importance of convenient seat adjustment. With that said, I can tell you that power seats are slow to adjust compared to manual seats, so in my opinion, I hate power seats, they are not convenient. Also something else to break.   I must be seeing something different than you are. What I see is that of the cars at the top of the page, only the Optima has over 20 ratings--and the Altima doesn\\'t show any ratings at all.  I think power seats are only an advantage if they offer greater range of movement than manually-adjusted seats. For most cars in this class, that is the case. Power seats typically offer two height adjustments, while manual seats normally have only one. The manual dual height adjusters like I have on my Elantra and MPV are becoming rare.   I think power seats are only an advantage if they offer greater range of movement than manually-adjusted seats. For most cars in this class, that is the case.Agreed. I also agree that it is just something else to go wrong and that is seldom the case with manual seats. Power seats do make driving more relaxing, comfortable, especially on long trips.  Well, only because most manually adjusted seats suck in terms of range of adjustability. I am sorry to see automakers such as Hyundai, Kia, and Mazda moving away from using manual height adjusters with two separate adjustments. I think it\\'s odd that you can get a seat like that on a low-bucks Accent or Rio but not on an Optima or Sonata.  The 8-way adjustable power seats in the Accord are great in that they can be tilted, making them very comfortable for just about anyone. The manual seats in my old Accord were quicker to move front to back though, so now I have to stand there a while waiting for the seat to move back, then get in (wife is only 5\\'4\" so the seat is way up after she drives it).  Has the highest rating of the cars listed at the top of this forum from Edmund users, with over 20 ratings being the minimum for my standards....first, the altima has no/zero/nil/nada reviews at all, so what were you saying? :P :confuse: second, your standards, as expressed by your previous posts, seem unrealistic and/or one-sided so they have little value to me.  :lemon:  Yes, that is why I like the 8-way (manual) seat on my Elantra, and a simiilar design (but without adjustable lumbar) on my MPV--the front of the seat bottom moves up and down independently of the rear, in effect tilting the seat cushion. Most power seats can do that, but few manual seats can these days. I don\\'t need the electric motors to move the seat for me as long as it has enough adjustments. But I suppose some folks would feel cheated if their mid-sized car didn\\'t come with a power seat.I can see an advantage of a power seat with memory settings if multiple people often drive the same car. But few cars we\\'re discussing here have memory seats.  I can see an advantage of a power seat with memory settings if multiple people often drive the same car. But few cars we\\'re discussing here have memory seats. Memory seats would be nice, but I would actually rather have adjustable pedals. Maybe in 2018 the 10th generation Accord will have them.  That\\'s when I can see myself shopping for a new car again (maybe a little before then).  Hello? By leaving out the main point of my post, you are completely misquoting me. You didn\\'t even indicate with an ellipsis that you had omitted one third of my post.The sentence that was in between the two sentences you quoted is:There\\'s no reason to extrapolate (your experiences) to becoming everyone\\'s experiences. We discuss anecdotal experiences here all the time. We just need to remember that they are exactly that - anecdotal and not statistically conclusive in any way.  I must be seeing something different than you are. What I see is that of the cars at the top of the page, only the Optima has over 20 ratings--and the Altima doesn\\'t show any ratings at all.Really? I see 27 reviews for the Altima. The only one that doesn\\'t have any ratings yet is the 08 Mazda6.  Our 2007 SEL AWD Fusion has an inside rear view mirror that electronically and automatically dims when it senses high beams behind the car. It\\'s a neat feature but I actually prefer mirrors with a manual mode for that function.  Our LeSabres have that feature but it can be turned off with a tap on the button and then turned on when you wish. Is that on your mirror?  Our LeSabres have that feature but it can be turned off with a tap on the button and then turned on when you wish. Is that on your mirror?Nope. Don\\'t see a way to disable it. No buttons.  If you don\\'t have the time to make the necessary adjustments or changes to your seat (and possibly mirrors,etc) then I really think you should slow down just a little. I have found that I get a better adjustment with the power seats over the manual. I would also agree it takes a few seconds for the power seats to adjust, but I don\\'t think that time is so critical, at least for me, that I don\\'t check my vehicle before driving off. It shouldn\\'t be more than a few seconds, or minutes at the most. By the way, yes auto seats can/do break at times. What else is new? Wow, did I say all that? Hmmmmm.  Yes, I see ratings for the Altima are there now. When I made my original post yesterday, there was just a blank space there for the Altima. I think another post from yesterday referred to this same issue, so apparently I wasn\\'t the only person who noticed it. But it\\'s fixed now.  When I made my original post yesterday, there was just a blank space there for the Altima.That\\'s what my display showed too.  Must have been an anomaly.  I never said that I don\\'t take the time to make the adjustments - I always do make safety #1. What I said was it takes longer to make the necessary adjustments with a power seat. I have never seen any stats that say power seats are safer, so I prefer quicker adjusting manual seats.I have never had a manual adjustment seat break on me, so that is a concern for ME.  Gotta get a memory seat. The adjustment happens before you get into the car as the door is opened.Power seats break as often as power windows. :surprise  Primarily, my point was safety, but also the ability to adjust more accurately to my personal preference. I have found the power seats although slower are able to better accomodate me. I haven\\'t had any of the adjustments break on me yet, but I am not at all surprised to hear of it happening. I too would be concerned about it. Glad you are with us on the safety points.   A few posts ago there was a small flurry of activity concerning the range of fuel economy numbers on the EPA window sticker. Some said why a range if the bold large numbers indicate the estimated economy numbers for their particular car? Someone else was on the right track when they said it was a range of fuel economy numbers for all like vehicles in the same size class then that thought got side tracked by what defines a \"class\" of vehicles. The truth of the matter is: Those numbers are there for use as a comparison to those thinking of buying a truck/car/SUV within the same size range as others. They are not assigned to specific vehicles but let the shopper know that \"somewhere out there\" there is another vehicle (within the same size class) that gets better (worse) estimated fuel economy than the one they are currently looking at by checking that range of numbers and comparing them to the bold numbers on the specific car. It is much the same as the energy ratings on your electric water heater..or refridgerator..or dishwasher..or clothes dryer. Your specific model is shown with an arrow along a linear chart showing some are more efficient some less. For once and for all I hope this dispels the idea that that range applies to one specific vehicle.  Power seats break as often as power windows. How often is that? Is it any more frequent than manual windows?Do not have much experience with power windows on older cars...we do have a \\'97 windstar and have not had a problem with them. Our other cars with power windows are less than 3 years old. In shopping for older cars for a couple kids recently, I have not seen many with power window problems. I only recall one and all it needed was a new switch.My daughter recently got rid of a contour with non-useable manual driver window...would have cost $150 or so to fix it, IIRC. The car was 11 years old when the stub that the crank connects to broke off.  Actually...the new stickers give both a range for the particular vehicle you are looking at and a range for the class.http://fueleconomy.gov/feg/ratingsNewSticker.shtml  Thanks, I learn something new almost every day.  Accord EX-L and EX-L/V6 have auto-dimming mirror standard (and accessory on other trims). Between those and manually adjusting mirror, I\\'m actually split. I have manual in my old Accord and auto in my TL.Manual responds immediately, and TL\\'s works but take a few seconds longer (after cold starts, I guess the chemicals inside the mirror casing take a little while to \"warm\").This is similar to manual seat adjustment versus powered (although in this case, I\\'m the only one who drives the Accord which has power seats and rarely needs adjustments, while TL has memory seats, so it adjusts itself before I get in the car).  In reality, people don\\'t use \"range\" to shop. They look at 20/30, and compare it to 22/32. Guess which they would like. As for range, the classification is based on EPA\\'s definition of class. So, Accord and Sonata fall outside the class which is the point of this discussion. Should we continue to discuss them in this thread?   Thanks, I learn something new almost every day.\"For once and for all\" did this teach you to do some research before typing out posts that are meant to make others look foolish? :P  Thanks for posting that \"new\" EPA sticker. I interpet it to mean that the big, bold number is the estimated average and the range is a comparision of different types of drivers for that vehicle, ranging from those who jump on the gas pedal (lower end of range) to those who accelerate (and brake) moderately (higher end of the range).  So, Accord and Sonata fall outside the class which is the point of this discussion. Should we continue to discuss them in this thread?That is a good question. What is a mid-sized sedan? Consider:* Versa is generally considered a subcompact but has mid-sized interior room.* Elantra and Sentra are generally considered compacts, but have mid-sized interior room which exceeds some of the cars listed for this discussion.* Accord and Sonata have large-car interior volume. So does Azera, actually more than either Accord or Sonata. But Accord is bigger outside than the Azera. Therefore, Accord is the mid-sized car and Azera is the large car. :surprise: If anyone has a \"definitive\" definition of what a mid-sized car is, I haven\\'t seen it. Some compare by interior room, some by length, some by price. Perrsonally, I compare by fitness to a particular purpose. So that pits cars like the Fit, Versa and Elantra against cars like the Mazda6, Optima, and Sonata--because they all fit my space requirements and are within my target price range.Who knows, maybe in a few years the set of mid-sized and large cars will be much different than it is now, e.g. mid-sizers will include Civic, Corolla, Elantra, and Sentra, and large cars will include Accord, Camry, and Sonata.  If anyone has a \"definitive\" definition of what a mid-sized car is, I haven\\'t seen it.I agree, Backy. Maybe cubic feet interior space would make for a creditable yardstick. Just a thought.  Others have been misinterpreting this \"range\" thing for quite a while and I thought it was time to clear it up. It really wasn\\'t my intention to make you look foolish. It\\'s really too bad one can\\'t even make a post here any more without sensitivity training.  It really doesn\\'t matter if you believe anyone uses that \"range\" section to shop or not. I didn\\'t mandate it I only attempted to explain it. But it seems I managed only to make some feel like fools. If you have comments about its use or non-use I suggest you email the EPA. Doesn\\'t matter to me what class you believe the Accord or Sonata falls into either because I didn\\'t classify them. See above suggestion about emailing the EPA. Finally, if you believe both fall outside the specifications of this thread then feel free to stop discussing either or both.  Since we\\'re talking EPA ratings and we can only use their standard (EPA\\'s definition of class). And they have three different standards.One applies to cars (typical sedan/coupe)Another to station wagons (like Versa, Fit etc)And finally, light trucks (SUVs, Pickups, Minivans) which actually uses GVWR for classification.By definition, a midsize \"car\" has 110-119 cu ft of cabin+trunk space. However, a midsize \"wagon\" has to have 130-159 cu ft of total volume.With 120-121 cu ft, Accord and Sonata fall out of midsize spectrum (by EPA\\'s definition of class, and EPA\\'s standard for fuel economy rating).  Then I\\'m assuming you\\'ve never quoted EPA rating for your car, have you? What is it anyway? :shades:  Others have been misinterpreting this \"range\" thing for quite a while and I thought it was time to clear it up. It really wasn\\'t my intention to make you look foolish. It\\'s really too bad one can\\'t even make a post here any more without sensitivity training.Maybe you missed this the first time around so I\\'ll post several for you to see this time.  :P :P :P :PDo you know what those mean? Talk about sensitive!!  Do you know what those mean?I don\\'t know what :P means. Explain please.  Edmunds spells it pblt (if you mouse-over the icon) but it is really &#147;BTTF&#148;. Ever wonder why most sci-fi movies show humans of the future living in caves or run down places? That&#146;s going &#147;Back To The Future&#148;. It is a part of next generation hieroglyphs. :P From wikipedia...:-p or  or :P or :-Þ : Smile with tongue out - used to denote either a \"raspberry\" or being \\'tongue in cheek\\' in English   The tongue is definitely not in the cheek on this particular Emoticon. \"Raspberry\" is the more apt description for it.  from what i see.... and it\\'s rating quite well!!!good for Nissan!  Yes, good for Nissan, and particularly for the Altima Coupe--24 of the 27 ratings are for the coupe. Maybe there aren\\'t many 2008 sedans in dealer lots yet?  Now, I dont want to send this thread back into warranty talk hell... but I was just doing a little research on the new Mitsubishi Lancer(that exterior is bad [non-permissible content removed]!), and noticed that Mitsubishi is offering a 5yr/60,000miles bumper to bumper warranty on their cars now. Is this new? Or has it always been like this? And does the Lancer fall into the midsize catagory, or is it compact, should i be discussing the Galant(which isnt as cool)instead?Not to say that I wouldn\\'t have purchased the car I did last month... but had I known they had matched the best warranty in america... I may have given a Mitsubishi car a second look, and test drive.  Mitsubishi has offered the 5 year/60k mile bumper-to-bumper and 10 year/100k mile powertrain warranty for several years.Galant is Mitsubishi\\'s mid-sized sedan entry--Lancer is a compact, although quite roomy inside. But more cool than the Galant.   What is your point? If the Sonata and Accord are considered large cars, instead of mid-size, wouldn\\'t that boost their MPG  relative ratings intheir new class.Exterior size seems to me to be a better difinition of \"mid-size\" or \"large\". Although it\\'s a bit of a mouthful, what\\'s wrong about talking about a mid-size car with large car interior room?I think that is basically saying what backy was saying.  I don\\'t think anyone shops for a car going by what the EPA (or anyone else\\'s) classification says. There are many \"Compact\" cars that are just as, or more comfortable than a \"Midsize\" car. Example: At one point I owned a 92 Nissan Sentra Coupe, and 92 Accord Sedan at the same time. Although the Accord had more interior room, the Sentra had a lot more leg room up front (basically because the front seat went all the way back to almost hitting the rear seat). How much interior room a car has, per EPA, has little to do with how comfortable it will be for a particular driver. You can\\'t tell how a car will fit you, by looking at the size rating on the sticker. You have to sit in it, and try it out for yourself. Someone may think a car classified as a \"Compact\" will be too small, and be very surprised by the actual room inside. So I think shopping cars going only by size class can be very misleading.  Yes, you have to check it out for yourself. Volume measurements don\\'t give the full picture. For example, some cars have big volume numbers because they are tall. If you\\'re 5\\'10\", do you really need 5\" over your head? And some cars do better than others in letting rear passengers slip their feet under the front seats. That can make a big difference in rear seating comfort.I would hope all prospective buyers do a \"sit test\", not just in the driver\\'s seat but in the rear, with someone who is as large as your largest typical passenger (for me, that was my big, tall oldest son).Doing a sit test can be surprising. For example, when I did that at the local auto show last March, I found that the rear seat of the Versa had more stretch-out leg room than the Altima next to it. Does the Altima have a bigger interior, in cubic feet? Sure. But the Versa had inches where it counted, plus a high driver\\'s seat that allowed feet to slip under it comfortably.  How often is that? Is it any more frequent than manual windows?Do not have much experience with power windows on older cars...we do have a \\'97 windstar and have not had a problem with them. Our other cars with power windows are less than 3 years old. In shopping for older cars for a couple kids recently, I have not seen many with power window problems. I only recall one and all it needed was a new switch.My daughter recently got rid of a contour with non-useable manual driver window...would have cost $150 or so to fix it, IIRC. The car was 11 years old when the stub that the crank connects to broke off.The power windows on the Contour were fine for the 10 yrs/150k time, while the Accord went through all of its power window motors and 2 antenna motors in that time. The only car that can beat that was the Reliant, which was the reason the Caravan had crank windows (which never failed). I think the biggest issue I had with manual windows (in a 70s Nova) was the part you hold on to, the little knob kept coming off.  Accord EX-L and EX-L/V6 have auto-dimming mirror standard (and accessory on other trims). Between those and manually adjusting mirror, I\\'m actually split. I have manual in my old Accord and auto in my TL.Manual responds immediately, and TL\\'s works but take a few seconds longer (after cold starts, I guess the chemicals inside the mirror casing take a little while to \"warm\").This is similar to manual seat adjustment versus powered (although in this case, I\\'m the only one who drives the Accord which has power seats and rarely needs adjustments, while TL has memory seats, so it adjusts itself before I get in the car).Our Subaru has that mirror, same one, same supplier. We have been told from other people who have that mirror that we have a 5 year life before it goes bad and permanently defaults to that green hue. I really don\\'t mind just flipping the little lever that much.  Why would I quote EPA numbers? I may have mentioned them when I first bought the car in response to specific questions about the, then new, 2006 Civic which was rare at the time but if you mean do I bring them up in daily conversation the answer is no. If you had been paying attention to posts about other makes (aside from Honda) and other owners experiences (in addition to your own) you would have seen my rather lengthy post about our 1995 Dodge Stratus. I posted it about the time you waxed eloquintly about your Accord. Also, from time to time I bring up our less than positive experiences with the 2006 Honda Civic EX sedan I bought in the fall of 2005.In answer to your question: 2006 Civic EX sedan automatic...1995 Dodge Stratus ES sedan...2000 Hyundai Elantra sedan. This is titled to me but our son drives and maintains it so for all intents and purposes it is his.  Emotocons and little cartoon characters do not change the intent of a post. I read the text (tone) of a post and whatever intent the little cartoons are supposed to accomplish..soften the tone make a virtual joke..whatever.. is usually lost on me. Sorry \"you\" ( a general YOU not you specifically) cannot post hostile/inflamatory/provoking text then at the end post a cutsey cartoon expecting that to make it all better. \"Oh, I didn\\'t really mean it\" Right!!  Emotocons and little cartoon characters do not change the intent of a post.Sure they do. It\\'s called sarcasm. Get over it. Just try to be more careful when trying to disprove someone next time is all I, and probably others, ask. Two of us were in agreement on what the EPA numbers show us because we looked it up. Nobody likes to be proven wrong, myself included, but it\\'s even worse when it\\'s done without any effort to find the facts. I\\'ve learned to laugh about it now and so should you.   articleI\\'m surprised nobody caught this yet. Overall, very positive comments from Edmunds.A couple items I noticed:With the VSA turned off, the engine electronics doesn\\'t allow full-throttle acceleration until 20 MPH. Honda\\'s worried about the possibility of too much torque steer? Whatever the reason, I\\'m sure Honda has good intentions, but to me, it\\'s another useless electronic watchdog.Also, why are they STILL cursing their cars with Michelin Pilot HXMX4 tires? They are quite possibly the WORST all-season touring tires invented, and can cost over $200 PER TIRE to replace, when much-better touring tires are available for half the cost or even less.Other than that, a very nice-looking machine that should continue to do well for Honda.  Probably going with Michelin because it\\'s a respected name associated with quality tires, vs. let\\'s say Kumho which makes an excellent tire from my experience, but not as respected a name.I replaced the OEM Michelins on my \\'01 Elantra with Kumhos that cost about 1/3 of what the Michelins cost, and they were quieter, had better all-weather performance, and lasted longer.  The Bridgestone Potenza G009s I have on my 1996 Accord are great tires (high-performance all-season) which I will use on my 2006 Accord when the Michelin\\'s wear out. They were $500 or so installed (185/65 15\") on my \\'96, much cheaper than the $880 the Michelin\\'s would cost on my new Accord (205/60 16\")  If I ask you, what is the EPA fuel economy rating of your car, what should I expect to hear from you? Let me see it.And when it comes to \"EPA rating\", it doesn\\'t count your opinion on what defines class. They stick to a standard definition. Or, are we to go with one\\'s whim? Then we have a chaos, and there is no need for standards.  With the VSA turned off, the engine electronics doesn\\'t allow full-throttle acceleration until 20 MPH. Honda\\'s worried about the possibility of too much torque steer? Whatever the reason, I\\'m sure Honda has good intentions, but to me, it\\'s another useless electronic watchdog.It is not due to electronic nanny of any kind. It is part of Honda&#146;s V6 design, or so I conclude based on my observation. Honda surprised a lot of us (I&#146;m speaking for another board which is largely for Honda enthusiasts) by putting 3.5-liter engine in the Accord while many were expecting a revised 3.0 or 3.2. Apparently, Honda&#146;s plan was to go with VCM version 2. With this version, there is little wiggle room in low-mid range since the engine is to operate in two additional modes (I-3 and V4). VTEC is busy doing that, trying to enhance around town/low throttle fuel economy.So, instead of 3.0 or 3.2, they went with 3.5 really tuned more like a 3.2 (as in my TL) up to about 3500 rpm (the \"eco zone\"). It is beyond this rpm that the hot cam takes over and VCM is out of the picture. The result is 3.5/V6 going full force (hence the peak numbers).The effect is that of a 3.2/V6 under 3500 rpm (which will coincide with about 20 mph) and 3.5/V6 above it. In non-VCM version (only Accord Coupe/6MT at this time), the engine is full force 3.5 right off idle. While with VCM, the engine now has more performance in low-mid range than the 3.0 offered before and a lot more performance on the highway.  With the VSA turned off, the engine electronics doesn\\'t allow full-throttle acceleration until 20 MPH. Honda\\'s worried about the possibility of too much torque steer? Whatever the reason, I\\'m sure Honda has good intentions, but to me, it\\'s another useless electronic watchdog. this type of \\'program\\' is also tied into whether the \\'watchdog\\' thinks the front wheels are straight as well, the Acura TL - and possibly tranny gear selections (the Toyota/Nissan approach). Things like this make you wonder though - what haapens when TV lawyers gets their teeth into your lawsuit contending you got into an accident because these \\'watchdogs/nannies\\' limited your ability to avoid it?  Lawyers will always find their way. Hey they won a case where coffee was hot! They would have won, if it were cold.That said, I used to think the TL had some kind of nanny via DBW to limit power around corners. My car has debunked my belief since. You can get on the throttle around a turn and it will take off, and in the direction you point it at.OTOH, Accord\\'s V6 (as I explained above) is due to VCM design. Now if Honda were limiting power in non-VCM V6 (Accord 6MT), that would debunk my theory. I haven\\'t heard about it yet.  So is there an Accord V6 sedan offered with a manual tranny? If so, is that limiter still in place? That would be terrible if it were IMO. The V6 coupe elimnates the VCM IIRC which would make it the only true sporty option if the limiter is there on a V6 MTX sedan. The new Mazda6 V6 is going to blow this thing away performance wise I\\'m guessing. It is bigger than the outgoing model but reportedly lighter IIRC. Plus the D37 engine will add roughly 50 HP and 50-60 ft-lbs of torque. Gas mileage will surely suffer though if that\\'s your bag.  No. 6MT is currently available only with coupe. Honda may add it to sedan lineup eventually (like they did with 2003-2007 generation, 6MT w/V6 was added in 2006). I was speaking of engine technology and why 3.5/VCM would feel different from 3.5/non-VCM. The 6MT mated V6 goes all out right from the get go (delivering at least 90% of its peak torque from 2000 rpm). The non-VCM version is actually very similar in design to Acura TL-S\\'s V6, except for using lower compression and being rated with regular grade gasoline. As for performance, Honda has rarely sought benchmarking performance with Accord in the American market. They have stuck with the middle ground to deliver \"almost\" the best of both worlds. It has been the winning formula for Honda, for a long time. I do wish that Honda would offer Accord with a sport trim (from the factory as opposed to offering dealer installed HFP package) to address the \"concerns\" of naysayers, but I guess they won\\'t do it unless sales (or lack of) demand it, and from the fear of seriously stepping on Acura\\'s toes (which is a sad fact that Honda has opted to live with).And we know, just performance doesn\\'t sell. The current Mazda6 is a prime example of it, even with about half of its sales going to fleet. It appeals to a small niche of buyers. Instead, Honda focused on what might help them in the longer term (again)... fuel economy. With a little road time, Accord V6 is unlikely to scare buyers away with its real world fuel economy, as some others might face when the prices go up (again) and they will.  So is there an Accord V6 sedan offered with a manual tranny?No. Not at this time.The new Mazda6 V6 is going to blow this thing away performance wise I\\'m guessing. It is bigger than the outgoing model but reportedly lighter IIRC.Well, that\\'s the global car anyway. We\\'ll see with the US-spec bumpers and other \"necessary\" safety equipment if this holds true.Gas mileage will surely suffer though if that\\'s your bag.That depends. Toyota does okay with a 6-speed auto with their V6 (only 1 MPG less on the highway compared to the Accord V6 w/5-speed auto and cylinder deactivation, IIRC). Since Mazda already uses a 6-speed auto, I don\\'t see why they can\\'t get similar results if they get the ratios correct.Then of course, Mazda always gears toward the performance crowd, buyers that don\\'t mind 1-2 MPG for better performance.We shall see.   If Mazda can soften the suspension in the 6 while not hurting performance, kind of like BMW does, then they should sell a lot more of them. Having owned one I can see how people would be turned off by the ride of one with the 17\" wheels/low profile tires. It was a bit harsh but a lot of fun at the same time. If you\\'re not looking for the latter you\\'ll walk the other way most likely.  Speaking of Edmunds\\' road test, while they compared Accord V6\\'s performance to Camry V6\\'s (from a previous comparison test), they didn\\'t compare observed fuel economy. I\\'m not sold on EPA ratings (although most buyers are going to be fixated on it). In the same test that Edmunds\\' quoted numbers from, Camry V6 got them 20.4 mpg. 2007 Accord V6, while having worse EPA rating, returned 21.4 mpg. The new Accord got 24.4 mpg.So, while Accord may be a few ticks slower in a 0-60 run, it got 20% better fuel economy. And speaking of acceleration numbers, I would love to see how these cars stack up in 30-50, 40-60 etc runs. They are far more useful measures in the real world (outside of drag racing).  Well, that\\'s the global car anyway. We\\'ll see with the US-spec bumpers and other \"necessary\" safety equipment if this holds true. Aren\\'t the bumpers larger across the pond due to their stricter pedestrian crash laws though?That depends. Toyota does okay with a 6-speed auto with their V6 (only 1 MPG less on the highway compared to the Accord V6 w/5-speed auto and cylinder deactivation, IIRC). Since Mazda already uses a 6-speed auto, I don\\'t see why they can\\'t get similar results if they get the ratios correct. I was only comparing it to the Accord because it is different, but you\\'re right, it shouldn\\'t be any worse than the Camry or others with similar drivetrains.  If Mazda can soften the suspension in the 6 while not hurting performance, kind of like BMW does, then they should sell a lot more of them.Honda does that. But it won\\'t put performance brakes/tires on cars. Although, 17\" rims are standard in Accord V6 (I think they have been for last generation too). Drive an Acura TL-S and that cars rides way better than one can expect it to be. I have a 2006 TL, and Honda softened the 2007 TL (base), but it actually handles just as well now with better ride.The downside to these refinements seems to show up in curb weight since most of it is probably achieved via stronger chassis.  Drop by this link to discuss the full test!  Aren\\'t the bumpers larger across the pond due to their stricter pedestrian crash laws though? IIRC, the pedestrian standards affect the hood height (in order to allow space between the bottom of the hood and the engine/chassis, so it can \"give\" and soften the blow to a pedestrian.)The larger bumpers are for the 5-MPH crash tests in the US.  Although, 17\" rims are standard in Accord V6 (I think they have been for last generation too).I don\\'t belive the rubber wrapped around them was as low profile or aggressive as the OEM rubber on the 6 though. Honda does that. But it won\\'t put performance brakes/tires on cars.Hopefully you were referring to the Acura models when you stated that. The Accord does ride softer than the 6 but it in no way handles the same as or better than it. Thus the tradeoff between handling and comfort. I don\\'t see Mazda moving away from an excellent handling car with the new 6 so it\\'s either going to be rough riding like the current model or they\\'ll have found a way to soften the ride without taking handling away. The latter should sell much better IMO.  That\\'s like arguing seatbelts kill people by preventing them from going through the windshield to safety.   What we have here is a communication breakdown...my posts, all of them, were regarding the pre-2008 EPA sticker where to be sure the range WAS meant provide consumers the range of fuel economy ALL cars within the same class could possibly be expected (per the EPA tests) to get. You, on the other hand, have been talking about 2008 EPA stickers. Yes, I didn\\'t closely read the new stickers and prior to the post that showed that new version didn\\'t know the range NOW shows a specific vehicle. The facts are..we have been talking about different things.  With 25.86 inch diameter wheel (17\" rim), the difference in thickness of rubber is just 0.2\" between Accord V6 and Mazda6/V6 Sport. It can\\'t make a huge difference in ride quality. Besides, Accord Coupe V6/6MT is equipped with even lower profile stock tires on 18\" rim, and it is said to ride very well (P235/45/R18).As far as handling goes, I have said it before, Honda hasn\\'t sold \"sport tuned\" Accord in America, and should. But for now, what we do get is one that has the balance to appeal to a wider audience. It is one of the reasons Honda sells as many Accords in a month as Mazda does selling 6 in six months.For sportier performance, Honda prefers to send buyers to Acura dealership (TSX), and while I don\\'t like the idea (I would rather see the formula applied to mainstream car) it is how the company has chosen to go about its business.And even TSX is far from being as sporty as some Accord models sold in Japan.  When I took my A3 to it\\'s 25K mile service at the dealership on a nice afternoon, I was given a 2005 Mazda 6 (what they called an MX-6 on the key chain) sedan with the anemic V6 engine and dual tailpipes. It had about 35,000 miles, and was seemingly fully loaded (6 CD changer, V6, 6 speed auto; which surprised me!, and leather seating that seemed to me to be pleather more than leather.I wasn\\'t feeling the leather seats, felt a lot like vinyl to me.... .is it?I wasn\\'t feeling the little V6, I thought perhaps it was a really great 4 cylinder. I honestly wasn\\'t sure if it was a V6 model until I looked under the hood. However, if it had been a 4 banger, I\\'d of said it was ever so slightly superior to Nissan\\'s 2.5 or Honda\\'s 4 banger. As a V6, it wasn\\'t that good; however, it\\'s midrange 3K to 5K power was quite good. It seemed to have less low end torque than a VTEC V6 though (which isn\\'t all that good to begin with).The car was floatier and softer than I expected; it actually rode very comfortably to me. Even though it bounced and floated when hitting expansion joints on the freeway exchange ramps, it held the ground like it was on rails despite all the soft slow movement in the cabin. I did take a ramp at a high rate of speed to test this. So it definitely handled as well as my Accord Coupe; would have to drive more to declare it a clear winner rather than a tie. I went through 3/8 of a gas tank in about 120 miles; not so good (though I don\\'t know what kind of mileage that is since I don\\'t know the tank size). I was exercising the engine to red line occassionally.The interior materials feel and look cheap to me. The car showed its wear (you Mazda lovers can blame that it\\'s a loaner/rental car, but I won\\'t accept that excuse entirely). The lighter gray plastics in the middle of the dash are the worst, including the matching trim on the sides and doors. The seats were comfy and sporty at the same time.The hatchback trunk was strange.... are all Mazda sedans equipped with the lifting rear window/trunk combo? That could be useful. I like that feature; provided it doesn\\'t cause more noise or other issues. I noticed the finish/fabric on the lid behind the rear seats covering the trunk was \"low rent.\"one note: the front tires were a bit low; probably around 25 psi. Overall grade B- bordering on straight B.Improve the interior materials and improve the engine, and Mazda may have something! Oh, what the heck is Mazda thinking with not having a trunk release button either on the remote or in the car? That was idiotic. Even a 2006 Civic has the buttons.  If Mazda can soften the suspension in the 6 while not hurting performance, kind of like BMW does, then they should sell a lot more of them. Honda does that. They forgot to do it on my \\'07 Accord EX then. It seems to be very effective at showing me expansion joints and pavement irregularities, yet still handles like a wet sponge.But it won\\'t put performance brakes/tires on cars.The brakes are okay, but its like they go out of their way to buy tires with low performance limits. I think its because they chose tires based on rolling resistance, which improves MPG at the cost of actually sticking to the road. The downside to these refinements seems to show up in curb weight since most of it is probably achieved via stronger chassis.I would hope so, since the carpet, floor mats, and other interior components seem to be of lower quality than my \\'93, so its definitely not materials or sound reduction components.  Ride: Are you saying Accord rides harsher than Mazda6? Then we need to go for a ride together. And while we\\'re at it, we might as well test the real road handling skills (instead of arm chair racing with printed spec sheet on hand).Tires: I haven\\'t noticed any decline in mileage since I replaced the OEM Michelins 132K miles ago. In fact, it went up. I\\'m thankful that Michelins that came with the car were overly expensive to replace. It gave me a good excuse to explore other options.Quality/Features: At one point, you had to buy floor mats (they are included now, or at least were a few years ago). My 98 actually has better quality to the controls than your 93. And back then, Hondas were well known for being ridiculously underfeatured and undertired (now I\\'m complaining about them going overboard with features and rim size). Heck, even the mainstream Civic now has bigger wheels than my 1998 Accord.  From many of your previous posts, you were not satisfied with your old (93) Accord, yet you bought another Accord (07). Which makes me wonder, why you keep buying these cars, if they are so bad? I don\\'t get it.Do you REALLY own an Accord? I\\'m really beginning to wonder. :confuse:  From many of your previous posts, you were not satisfied with your old (93) Accord, yet you bought another Accord (07). Which makes me wonder, why you keep buying these cars, if they are so bad? I don\\'t get it.Do you REALLY own an Accord? I\\'m really beginning to wonder. I wasn\\'t dissatisfied with the \\'93, it was about as good as the Contour and the Jetta, it just was apparently not this holy grail I should\\'ve been expecting.As far as the \\'07, it was definitely a mistake. It was a very good deal at the time but generally speaking one of the most soulless cars I have driven. It was at a low point of other things going on in my life. My goal right now is to keep it as pristine as possible and hopefully learn about the incredible resale it should have in a year or so. I have no idea why I bought it, I have never been so underwhelmed with a vehicle.I take that back, as I mentioned previously, it does a fantastic job with holding the infant seat, and it gets mileage in the mid-30s. That screams driving enjoyment to me.  Ride: Are you saying Accord rides harsher than Mazda6? Then we need to go for a ride together. No, I think the Mazda is aggressive, but at least it can go around a cloverleaf without feeling like it was scrapping its doorhandles on the pavement.Tires: I haven\\'t noticed any decline in mileage since I replaced the OEM Michelins 132K miles ago. In fact, it went up. I\\'m thankful that Michelins that came with the car were overly expensive to replace. It gave me a good excuse to explore other options. That treadwear number on the tire - the higher the number, the harder the rubber, and the longer the wear. The number is also roughly inversely correlated with rolling resistance - soft, sticky tires by design have more rolling resistance and thus, lower mileage, while highway tires are designed to roll quietly and efficiently.Quality/Features: At one point, you had to buy floor mats (they are included now, or at least were a few years ago). Yeah, the floor mats on the \\'93 were an additional ~$90. I wouldn\\'t pay anything for the floor mats that came on the \\'07 EX. My 98 actually has better quality to the controls than your 93.You know, that is one area I never complained about, the controls always had a great feel to them. Same with the \\'93 and \\'07.And back then, Hondas were well known for being ridiculously underfeatured and undertired (now I\\'m complaining about them going overboard with features and rim size). Heck, even the mainstream Civic now has bigger wheels than my 1998 Accord.The \\'93 had 195/60R15s on alloy wheels. I thought that was fine for the size and weight of the car. When I replaced the highway Michelins with performance oriented Kumhos (and the stock 130k shocks with aftermarket replacements), the car handled very well and was fun to drive.  I got a 2007 Mazda6 rental the other day. It was a 6i VE with the 17\" wheels, sport cloth interior with power seat, leather wheel, ground effects, even a rear spoiler (thought that was unusually sporty for Hertz). I thought the I4 with 5AT was plenty peppy, but then, my daily driver has only 138 hp. Re the ride, I was mildly surprised at the ride comfort with the 17\" wheels. The car glided over all but the biggest bumps smoothly and quietly, yet handled crisply. I would say that it did indeed ride more smoothly than an Accord, at least the 2003-2007 generation. Maybe the Accord\\'s ride has been smoothed out for 2008, as per some reviews.One nice thing about traveling a lot is that I get a chance to try out lots of cars... except Accords.   Sorry if you were confused by my response.The EPA rating on my \\'05 Sonata is 19/27. I average, year round, including summer with A/C and winter temps in the teens, right about the EPA estimate for city. I drive less than 3 miles to work and most trips are less than 5 miles. I do very little highway driving so I can\\'t really comment on that except for 2 instances. I bought the car new in Florida and drove it home to CT (1300+ miles) and after about 700 miles did better than the EPA estimate, going with the traffic flow and using cruise control when traffic permitted. I know the EPA uses their own definition of class sizes. I was merely responding to your earlier post questioning if the Sonata & Accord should be considered in the large car rather than mid-size forum discussions. I was trying to say that comparing the milage figures for the Sonata & Accord would lean in favor of those cars when compared to cars than are larger in exterior size (and probably weight). BTW, have you finally learned the information you claimed to be trying to obtain for your friends to help them determine what car they should buy?  I replaced the OEM Michelins on my \\'01 Elantra with Kumhos that cost about 1/3 of what the Michelins cost, and they were quieter, had better all-weather performance, and lasted longer.Well according to you, anything Korean is better.   I keep hearing how bad American car sales are...If American branded cars are selling so poorly, then why aren\\'t there more for sale on dealers lots? The local Saturn dealership has turned into some \\'used car\\' headquarters, with very few new Saturns to see, the two Ford dealerships have very few cars to choose from, and the \"Number 1\" Chevy dealership in town has fewer than 10 cars under $20K (but over 50 dumb trucks). Meanwhile, the Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai dealerships are balls-to-the-wall in new cars of all colors, shapes, sizes, and prices. It\\'s no wonder American branded car sales are down - there\\'s no reasonable selection to choose from.  Can\\'t someone make a post around here without a personal attack?  It\\'s no wonder American branded car sales are down - there\\'s no reasonable selection to choose from.During the recent short-lived strike against GM (thankfully short) I read than GM had a 90 day inventory of cars compared to a 60 day inventory a year ago. Maybe the problem in you area is a distribution problem.  My Kumho Ecsta ASXs were $40/tire in a 195/60R15, have a VR speed reading, were great in the rain and okay in the snow, and had great turn in and a responsive ride. The Energy MXV4s they replaced were over $100/tire, okay in rain and good in snow, and handled like a pig on rollerskates.  No you moron, we can\\'t!  :P KIDDING buddy. I\\'m right with ya on that one.  No, I think the Mazda is aggressive, but at least it can go around a cloverleaf without feeling like it was scrapping its doorhandles on the pavement.I will be glad to \"follow you\" in your Mazda. Where do we meet? That would be better than internet racing, or worse, pulling arguments out of thin air. Eventually, I will let you follow me.   No, I think the Mazda is aggressive, but at least it can go around a cloverleaf without feeling like it was scrapping its doorhandles on the pavement. I will be glad to \"follow you\" in your Mazda. Where do we meet? That would be better than internet racing, or worse, pulling arguments out of thin air. Alas, individual differences may also play a part, I wouldn\\'t want to disadvantage the Accord any further with your driving :P I will see if I can borrow the GPS tool from work - its kind of like one of those g-analyst things you see advertised in magazines.Bench racing aside, I have gotten the \\'93 to go faster around the I94 to Michigan Ave cloverleaf than the \\'07, and I wasn\\'t wrestling with it as much and it definitely didn\\'t feel like the doorhandles were dragging. My \\'89 Galant did that, but at the time it was probably a good thing.  Well, have you considered the possibility that may be true? Maybe anything(insert your choice of country of origin here) is \"better\" for you. Kindly don\\'t insist it should be mine also.  Oh, what the heck is Mazda thinking with not having a trunk release button either on the remote or in the car? That was idiotic. Even a 2006 Civic has the buttons. My 2004 6 had a trunk release on the fob and on the lower left (of the steering wheel) dash. I don\\'t think they changed that for \\'05 so I\\'m not sure what you were missing.The hatchback trunk was strange.... are all Mazda sedans equipped with the lifting rear window/trunk combo?No. Only the hatchback model. The sedan has a regular trunk opening and the wagon has, well, a wagon hatch.I mostly agree with your assessment of the engine too. I felt the V6 was a bit underpowered when paired with the ATX. However, when paired with the MTX, which I had, you are free to access the power, that doesn\\'t come in until about 3500 RPMs as you stated, freely and then it really comes to life. Even with the lack of low end power it was always more than adequate to putz around town in. Drag racing required some high revving lauches though.  Like I said, no more arm chair racing.   I bought a Mazda6, same as Backy drove as a rental recently, and drove Honda Accords before I bought. I\\'m a mature driver(read what you want into that term) but really appreciate a decent handling car. I totally agree with Backy and that is one of the main reasons(besides price)that I bought the Mazda. When driving the Honda I felt the princess in the fairy tale that feels the peas under her mattress---nearly every expansion strip was felt. I expected to feel more bumps with the Mazda but was pleasantly suprized that I don\\'t.  May be my experiences have been an aberration. So, perhaps I should replace the vanilla Sonata rental, that is parked on my drive way at this moment, with a Mazda6.  My 2004 6 had a trunk release on the fob and on the lower left (of the steering wheel) dash. I don\\'t think they changed that for \\'05 so I\\'m not sure what you were missing. I think perhaps the hatchback and the wagon are missing a trunk/hatch release, while the sedan has the buttons on the key fob/remote and by the steering wheel...... I\\'m just assuming that\\'s the difference that occurred, or did Mazda run out of trunk release buttons at the factory in 2005? :P The hatchback model looks just like the sedan; doesn\\'t it? It had a big spoiler and the ground effect aerodynamic trim too. All things I\\'d give up for 25 more HP.I was a bit concerned at the interior scuffing and wear and tear shown on this 2 year old 36K mile vehicle from Mazda. I don\\'t care if it was abused, it needs to handle the abuse better. It did seem as if the dealer kept it very clean too.  Can\\'t someone make a post around here without a personal attack?Personal attack? Huh? I was referring to your obvious slant (to be mild about it) towards Korean products. I\\'ve made pro-Honda/Nissan/Japanese assertions that have attracted similar respnses and don\\'t go round with my feelings hurt. I guess only the kumbaya comments are expected around here.  The point is that the personal comments are inappropriate and only serve to derail the conversation (as we see here). If you want to post something about the cars - kumbaya or boobayah - that\\'s great. If you want to make some kind of comment or insinuation about a poster, then - please. just. skip. it.  I didn\\'t know the Mazda6 is made in Korea. Did Mazda open a factory there recently? I also thought the Versa is a Nissan design, made in Mexico, not Korea. And that\\'s interesting that GM is making (or will soon make) the Malibu in Korea. But that is why these discussions are so great, you can learn something every day.  Vanilla??I thought the color was called \"powder white pearl.\"  I also drove the Sonata twice in my quest for a new vehicle. I was pretty impressed with how quiet it was and it drove very nice but like you say, it seemed rather \"vanilla\". Just couldn\\'t put my finger on it but it seemed just a little rough around the edges here and there. My daughter had an 2002 Elantra and she had good luck with but she would be the first to admit that it was about 95% there in relation to the Japanese cars. Price/value though Hyundai is hard to beat unless you want something that drives a little sportier.  I think perhaps the hatchback and the wagon are missing a trunk/hatch release, while the sedan has the buttons on the key fob/remote and by the steering wheel...... I\\'m just assuming that\\'s the difference that occurred, or did Mazda run out of trunk release buttons at the factory in 2005?IIRC, the 5-door unlocks ALL the doors when the unlock button is pressed on the fob, including the hatch. I don\\'t know why they don\\'t have an interior release though. zzzoom6 can answer this one better than I can, since he\\'s got the 5-door.All things I\\'d give up for 25 more HP....Or driving a manual compared to the power-sapping slushbox. Trust me, the manual pulls nicely, without the need for 25 more HP on the freeway onramps.I was a bit concerned at the interior scuffing and wear and tear shown on this 2 year old 36K mile vehicle from Mazda. I don\\'t care if it was abused, it needs to handle the abuse better. It did seem as if the dealer kept it very clean too.The dealer can clean it as much as they want to, but it\\'s still a rental, subject to much more wear-and-tear and abuse than what anyone would do to their own car. My \\'04, OTOH, is free of any scratches or blemishes on the dash and center console. The carpeting and the back seats look as good as new as well, even with all the abuse they get from my job (visiting construction sites, carrying equipment, etc.)The only thing I\\'m not too thrilled about is the cloth seat material on the drivers seat. With only 57K miles on it, it looks worse than many cars with 100-150K miles on them. It\\'s worn almost down to nothing. It\\'s a common problem with the \\'03-\\'05 models, and the \\'06-up material was changed with the seat redesign, with no significant complaints since.  The unlock button does indeed unlock the trunk/hatch/door, however, I\\'d still like a \"trunk open/release button\" that actually OPENS the hatch by a 1/2 inch or so and you know its unlocked. The auto slushbox has 6 gears to work with, so it should be a good slushbox and not saap too much power. Too bad they don\\'t have manual tranny rental/loaners.  The hatchback model looks just like the sedan; doesn\\'t it? Pretty much, yes. The hatch has a slightly longer C pillar and shorter trunk lid. The big giveaway is the rear wiper on the hatch which the sedan does not have either.  The number of gears won\\'t make driveline loss due to having an automatic any less, I believe - it\\'ll just make better use of the power due to better ratios.  The new automatics seemed to be almost on par with the manuals as far as efficiency. You don\\'t see the big difference in performance and FE as you used to.  I get about the same mpg in my Mazda6, 5 speed automatic as I used to get in my 5 speed manual Contour. This despite the Mazda\\'a weighing several hundred pounds more. I think the acceleration of my 6 is also about the same as the manual contour...both were measured at around 9.5 sec. for 0-60, IIRC. To me, this is adequate. Of course, a manual in the 6 would be faster...depending on driver skill.Once upon a time, I bought a manual Voyager to get 5 gears, instead of 3 and 5 mpg better gas highway mileage. Also once upon a time, I felt power of 4 cylinders was always inadequate with an automatic.  Also once upon a time, I felt power of 4 cylinders was always inadequate with an automatic.What changed your opinion?   What changed your opinion?More power, more efficient automatic trannys?  If one goes by EPA rating, probably. But fundamentally, a typical manual transmission can be expected to have 5% lower drive train loss over a typical automatic, which by itself will contribute towards better fuel economy.But, 5% on EPA mode is barely 1 mpg on a car getting 20 mpg, so it seems negligible. This is besides the fact that EPA mode is a bit too standardized to see the impact of power, and driving style. The latter will largely dictate real world fuel economy but can&#146;t be standardized in any other way. However, a driver has better chance to improve fuel economy with manual transmission (beyond that 5% increased efficiency) than with automatic.Some newer automatics are closing the gap, however. For example, by getting rid of torque converter as in Antonov design, efficiency is improved, and as a result, fuel economy (Honda Civic&#146;s i-Shift 6-speed automatic in Europe is designed around this premise).  What changed your opinion? More power, more efficient automatic trannys? Yep.  However, a driver has better chance to improve fuel economy with manual transmission (beyond that 5% increased efficiency) than with automatic. Perhaps, but there is also a chance that instead one will drive in a way that gets worse mileage. I know that is likely the case with me, I can\\'t see the point in a manual if I\\'m gonna baby the trottle and shift at 2000 rpm.  Yes. I have seen some terrible shift stick guys. But they go for manual to take control of their car as much as they want. I would too, although when one has to share a car with the significant other, who is completely opposed to manual transmission, it isn\\'t always possible. That would explain why I couldn\\'t hold onto my Prelude/MT for too long (even though there was another car in the household with AT).  MTs must be, of course, more efficient than ATs simply because there is a lot less in mechanical drivetrain losses - but this (efficiency) is simply not the case considering the way most folkls drive MTs in relation to the optimal (efficiency) operating parameters of the engines themselves. Things like overevving in a specific gear (boy doesn\\'t that sound and feel good) and even more often \\'lugging\\' an engine (boy I am just too lazy to shift) will both promote less than the best fuel economies available and may also damage an engine. An AT, however makes these selections for you and will also keep any engine in peak efficiency ranges more often - generally the more speeds available the better. For a majority of our drivers out there, I submit that a good multi speed AT will do better FE wise in those condtions where a driver would normally \\'need\\' to shift a bunch - a constant highway speed drive a different story, however. My contention here is not that the MT isn\\'t naturally more economical, it is more along the lines that very few of us drive them in such a manner that \\'allows\\' them to be more economical.  Exactly...plus even in the case of constant highway speed don\\'t the automatics lock up.  Nah, it doesn\\'t take highway speed to do that. I can get my car\\'s 4AT to lock up at around 35 mph when cruising, at which point it\\'s doing about 1400 RPM. Not bad for a 2.0L 4-banger.   Sure...should have said at steady speeds it will lock-up and should be just as efficient as a manual (if my understanding is correct). In addition, these days the top gear in a 5 (or more) speed automatic usually has a higher ratio than the manual...which should mean the auto should be more efficient when in locked up mode. That was another reason for my switch...I believe Mazda6 manual runs at about 25% higher rpm than the auto in top gear.When I had a manual, I sure was never driving around at 1500-2000 rpm, like the auto is at steady lower speeds.  Being more efficient by nature, MT is naturally more economical. But that doesn\\'t mean everybody is capable of taking advantage of that fact. Ask hypermilers.They don\\'t necessarily show their advantage on EPA cycle (which goes largely by set acceleration pace for ALL cars and regardless of gearbox type).I believe Mazda6 manual runs at about 25% higher rpm than the auto in top gear.That is usually the case with most cars. But the reason generally is that MTs are typically designed with performance in mind, and have shorter low gears. And with limited gear span, they end up having shorter top gear too. OTOH, check out BMW\\'s SMG. It has 7-speeds, and one of the shortest geared transmission you can find in the market with a top gear overall drive ratio of ~3.00:1 (and that, while being mated to a V10).  It depends on how the tranny is geared. For example, I\\'ve found that some 4ATs have some pretty high ratios, so the engine is turning a lot less than with a MT even with only four forward speeds. Likewise, I\\'ve found that some cars with a 6MT really don\\'t have any taller of a top gear than do 5MTs, why I don\\'t know.  So far so good...The 2009 Sonata will be available around March for Sale.Some of the highlights include.*Azera lookin front end*Horsepower increase for both 4cyl and V6*Improved fuel economy for both engines*5 speed auto trans for 4cyl*Blue background dashboard lights*Improved handling and ride*Specific sport handling for SE model*Redone interior featuring, more storage,better finish,less plastic looking*USB port and i-pod jack*Exhaust tuned for performance sound  I get about the same mpg in my Mazda6, 5 speed automatic as I used to get in my 5 speed manual Contour. This despite the Mazda\\'a weighing several hundred pounds more. I have a 2005 Mazda6 i 5-door manual, and I got 30.5 mpg\\'s going 80mph. I just had a trip to upstate NY, and got 470 miles on 15.4 gallons of gas. A/C was on for the majority too. I\\'m quite happy, I must say, considering the sticker said 31 mpg\\'s.  I got to sit in the new Accord today, an EX V6 with nav, $30,895 list price, black on black. The dealer will have an open house next week, so I hope to drive some then. Here\\'s initial impressions:* Nice side profile. The big grille doesn\\'t look so bad on a black car, but I still haven\\'t warmed up to it. Alloys are a little elaborate for my taste, but are not bad looking.* Very comfortable driver\\'s seat, nice fat leather steering wheel, Civic-like spoke design. Gauges light up on entry--looks OK (even with plain white backlighting), but I\\'m wondering... why?* Center stack is a maze of small dark buttons, set close together, and one big dial. Not my preference for controls, but maybe other folks love all the buttons. The buttons have a solid feel--not sure why others have reported they feel cheap.* Fat leather-covered armrest, slides fore and aft.* The silver-colored plastic trim doesn\\'t look worthy of a $31,000 car. Looks more like something I\\'d expect in a Chevy or Dodge. At least it breaks up the otherwise all-black interior. I know some people like black interiors, but it seemed too tomb-like to me.* The back seat didn\\'t seem any roomier than the 2007 model, but I wasn\\'t able to take advantage of the extra width. Knee room is fine (I\\'m 5\\'10\"), but there\\'s a big problem in the back: toe room is very tight under the front seats, to the point where I couldn\\'t stretch out my legs to take advantage of the knee space and thus my thighs were not well supported. That makes the back seat OK only for kids and short adults. There\\'s a center armrest in the back, with a cheap-looking one-piece plastic cupholder--no lid, no grippers, just two holes.* Overall the interior quality seems pretty good, except for sharp flashing on the tops of the door bins. Also, the black leather is stiff; it seemed more \"buttery\" on older Accords. Maybe it will wear well.* The trunk is fairly small for the class and is hampered by hinges that take up trunk space (odd that there aren\\'t struts on a $31k car) and a floor that isn\\'t flat--it bulges up around the wheel housings. It\\'s nicely lined, though.Just based on sitting in the car, I was not impressed. For a car that list for over $30k, I expected more. Maybe it was the black interior; perhaps the tan leather would look richer. I also expected better rear-seat accomodations given the size of the car, and its price.  I have always liked Mazda\\'s, ever since I drove their first Wankle powered sedan. But it sound like they have gone more for the econo/green mode than the Zoom Zoom they advertise.So other than great mileage, how did you like the car?  actually owned an RX2, about 1972 or so, if I remember right. A very unusual drive in its day - would seemingly rev forever, crappy FE, but decent power. Overheated once and that was that - threw away the engine. Overall I think I liked the Wankel, but to this day Mazda has not solved the FE issues, the current RX8 nothing to write home about.  they have gone more for the econo/green mode than the Zoom Zoom they advertiseahh, the power of advertising - while it is true that Mazdas \\'feel\\' (and to some look) sportier than the other cars in this group, they are very behind, FE and power wise. Part of being \\'Fordified\\' I guess because the leaders in the \\'green\\' dept come from elsewhere as well. IMO, Mazda would and could build a more competitive car without Dearborn bringing them down.  because the leaders in the \\'green\\' dept come from elsewhere as well.Ford has consistently been the leader in emissions thanks to Bill Ford. Ford has more PZEV vehicles in California than any other mfr. There are different definitions for being \"green\" - it\\'s not just FE.  It\\'s a shame more people don\\'t pay attention to those numbers - FE gets all the glory, and in that department, Ford hasn\\'t really been all that great (although the new 260 hp Taurus has very good numbers at 18/28MPG, right on the Avalon\\'s and Accord\\'s heels.  nice fat leather steering wheel, Civic-like spoke design. Accord and Civic have very different spoke design on the steering wheel, unless you\\'re comparing coupe to coupe (even they are different).odd that there aren\\'t struts on a $31k carIt was odd for me to see hinges (as opposed to struts) in some luxury cars, and I gave it some thought. I can see two reasons:- Hinges last forever (struts can go bad)- Hinges are easier to operate (struts make the trunk lid operation stiffer), and perhaps also a reason I saw its use in some luxury cars with power trunk option.For a car that list for over $30k, I expected more. Maybe it was the black interior; perhaps the tan leather would look richer.Let me guess... you were expecting a boat load of wood trim. :P  The silvery trim on the wheel reminds me of the Civic\\'s wheel.One reason you didn\\'t mention is that a couple of pieces of metal (hinges) are cheaper to make than two hydraulic struts (decontenting). I can\\'t imagine any part \"going bad\" on an Accord, can you? Actually I think the wood trim on the new Accord is overdone, i.e. too much on the doors. But IMO tan leather and some color variation in a cabin can look richer than all-black.  The silvery trim on the wheel reminds me of the Civic\\'s wheel. Me too. In fact, the shift-knob and the steering-wheel instantly reminded me of my dad\\'s 2007 Civic Sedan.One reason you didn\\'t mention is that a couple of pieces of metal (hinges) are cheaper to make than two hydraulic struts (decontenting)Ha, wouldn\\'t they have to have the content (struts) in the first place in order to DEcontent?  :P Our Accords have never had struts for the trunk.  FE gets all the glory, and in that department, Ford hasn\\'t really been all that greatExactly. Not only did Ford ignore FE to focus on emissions (pun intended) - they never advertised their emissions leadership. I think old Billy just did it to make himself feel good. At one time a 4.0L Explorer had lower emissions than a Prius. But nobody outside of a few Ford enthusiasts know about it.That\\'s all changed now as evidenced with the Taurus. I expect similar gains as the new engines are rolled out across the board and tuned.  The silvery trim on the wheel reminds me of the Civic\\'s wheel.You were claiming the spoke design was similar. Now I guess it is about use of silver trim which probably serves a purpose against the \"stark\" black trimmings something you complained about earlier. But if you want to talk about silvery trim, Civic wasn\\'t the first to have it. In fact, Accord sedan\\'s steering wheel (design and trimming) resembles this more...And that is from 2003 Pilot. So, when should we expect the Civic-like silvery trim to make it into Sonata? As for hinges versus struts, the idea is to minimize \"breaking points\". Keeping it simple works better, at least in my opinion. If you haven\\'t figured it out, don\\'t worry, it ain\\'t the end of the world.  I have always liked Mazda\\'s, ever since I drove their first Wankle powered sedan. But it sound like they have gone more for the econo/green mode than the Zoom Zoom they advertiseI love the car. It handles better then most mid-sized sedans. Reliability has been great, no repairs of any kind. I currently have 35K on it. I do think Mazda\\'s could be more fuel effeciant, although, I will not complain about the gas mileage. The reason why the 2.3L Mazda6 is only rated at 31 highway is because of the way it is geared. At 70mph, the engine is turning about 3,200 RPM\\'s, and at 80mph, it is turning 3,500 RPM\\'s. I suspect with a higher top end gear ratio, the highway fuel economy would be better. However, Mazda chose a lower gearing because even in top gear, the engine is right in the power band, and can easily gain speed. That is the Zoom-Zoom way. Mazda engineers their vehicles to perform. They do not advertise fuel economy as their main attraction, like Honda does. Mazda promotes how much fun their vehicles are to drive. I would disagree that Mazda\\'s are more econo/green then Zoom-Zoom.My Mazda6 is also a PZEV. Totally green? No, but darn close. Mazda\\'s are not bad for the environment.Ford is not holding Mazda down in terms of what they are building. Take a look at what they offer, and then take a look at what Ford offers. No comparison.Is the Mazda6 more fuel efficant then Accord or Camry? No. Do Accord and Camry have driving dynamics like the Mazda6. No. I chose fun over a few MPG\\'s. Bottom line, I love my Mazda6.  Quite right! Better example: changing out the 60/40 split rear seat for a one-piece folding rear seat.  while it is true that Mazdas \\'feel\\' (and to some look) sportier than the other cars in this group, they are very behind, FE and power wise.Yeah, that usually happens when a car that\\'s essentially been out for SIX years is compared to models re-designed and re-engineered since then.IMO, Mazda would and could build a more competitive car without Dearborn bringing them down.If it wasn\\'t for Ford buying the 33.4% share in Mazda, I doubt Mazda would EXIST (let alone thrive) in 2007. Mazda has set personal sales records with both the 3 and 6 since being \"Fordified\", and there wouldn\\'t be ANY V6 for the NA-market 6 without Ford.Mazda may not be selling in CamCord territory, but they are quite possibly the ONLY division making $$$ for Ford.And in terms of them being \"competitive\", that essentially means \"dumbing-down\" their product in order to appeal to the mass-market, and not the sporty crowd. I believe this move was tried in the mid-late \\'90s with the deceased 626, and that\\'s what led them to a lack of sales (and Ford eventually bailing them out) in the first place.  Actually, I\\'ve understood this to be for rigidity, but I don\\'t really know. If I needed a car for cargo more often than my limited use, I\\'d get a CR-V. Similar driving experience to an Accord, just a little slower.  OK, if you want to nit-pick, let me be really clear: the silvery trim on the spokes reminds me of the Civic\\'s wheel. Looks like I\\'m not the only one who sees a resemblence. But why be so sensitive about a comment like that? Why is a family resemblence an issue?Thanks for explaining Honda\\'s strategy re minimizing breaking points, simple is better etc. That would explain why they made the 2-piece folding rear seat one piece for 2008. Also I guess it would explain why they went to a 5-speed automatic for 2003 rather than the 4-speed, because the 5-speed would be less likely to br... oh. Never mind. :blush:  That would explain why they made the 2-piece folding rear seat one piece for 2008.Actually, it has been one piece ever since I remember (my 1996 is a one-piece, as is my 2006).My dad had some base model (DX) Civics that didn\\'t have A/C standard, but they had that split rear seat!  Mazda may not be selling in CamCord territory, but they are quite possibly the ONLY division making $$$ for Ford.Mazda will never sell anything close to numbers you see from Honda/Toyota. They are OK with that. Mazda is making lots of money, showing Ford great return on their 33.4% stake in the company.Keep in mind, Mazda has the youngest average aged buyer in the entire industry, and they want to keep it that way. It is very important in terms of building brand loyalty when you have the youngest buyer. As long as Mazda keeps doing what they are doing, they will be around for a long time, and will only get bigger and more profitable.  Actually, I\\'ve understood this to be for rigidity, but I don\\'t really know. If I needed a car for cargo more often than my limited use, I\\'d get a CR-V. Similar driving experience to an Accord, just a little slower.If you feel that a chunky sport-cute with a higher center of gravity and high profile tires has a similar driving experience to an Accord, that doesn\\'t speak to highly of the Accord. That is not to say you aren\\'t correct though.  I stand corrected then. I read that the rear seat was 60/40 in the prior generation (2003-7) but is now one-piece. Maybe the review was in error?  I\\'m sure you\\'re not alone. BTW, the Civic-like steering spoke design has made it into a Hyundai... let us talk family resemblance. :shades: If it were just another \"family resemblance\" thing, why would you bring it up? I guess you\\'re not used to it in the Hyundai world. As for rear seat back, my 1998 Accord has one piece too. That is very un-Civic-like. And my 2006 TL\\'s back seat doesn\\'t even fold down (and neither it does in my friend\\'s BMW M5). It has got cross members for additional structural rigidity. But that may not be important to you.As for 4-speed versus 5-speed, well, you have to first have a clue about why engineers go for additional speeds. I\\'m willing to bet you don\\'t.  Another good reason to not rely on \"reviews\" by automotive journalists.   It speaks highly of CR-V, actually. It is one of the very few SUVs I would ever consider getting (but I won\\'t).  Actually a one-piece folding seat back is very Civic-like. Those are pretty common on Civics in recent years.For me, the utility of a 60/40 folding rear seat is important. If an automaker can\\'t make a car rigid enough and still offer a 60/40 rear seat, well, that\\'s not my problem.As for not having a clue, every time someone takes a personal shot here rather than having a civil discussion, I just figure they have nothing else of value to say on a subject.  Why do you take an innocent little comment and turn it into an argument with derogatory personal comments?  Actually a one-piece folding seat back is very Civic-like. Those are pretty common on Civics in recent years. Civics have had 60/40 split-folding seat backs for years. I know, because I had a 2000. Accords haven\\'t had it in several years. So, I\\'m still trying to figure out the point you\\'re trying to make here.the utility of a 60/40 folding rear seat is important. If an automaker can\\'t make a car rigid enough and still offer a 60/40 rear seat, well, that\\'s not my problem.May be it is to you. But I\\'m sure BMW and Honda engineers have good reasons for it.So, I read something about taking a \"shot\" here. Are you talking about me posting a picture of \"civic-like\" steering wheel on Veracruz?   Game. Set. Match. Malibu is and will be a loser, there is no way it can compete as I quote from Edmunds\\' own review \"Despite a standard six-speed automatic, the V6 Malibu returns EPA fuel-economy figures of 17 city and 26 highway &#151; a couple of mpg worse than its competitors.\"There is no way people are going to buy an inefficient 6 speed auto mated to an inefficient V6 engine. Gas is way to0 expensive to be buying less for the same amount of money. Also, our environmental future relies on companies that produce more fuel efficient vehicles. Again, why would anyone in their right mind settle for less power and less fuel economy at the same time?  If it wasn\\'t for Ford buying the 33.4% share in Mazda, I doubt Mazda would EXIST (let alone thrive) in 2007. Mazda has set personal sales records with both the 3 and 6 since being \"Fordified\", and there wouldn\\'t be ANY V6 for the NA-market 6 without FordMazda\\'s engine development capabilities WERE adequately demonstrated in the Speed6 - and now all we get is a lousy 200hp and mediocre FE in a definitively non competitive Ford engine - and this is good? Mazda sets \\'sales records\\' only because of some non-Japanlike discounting, whether the divison makes any real money is dubious at best. The company has historically been quite innovative and made some quite good cars. What happened, if not for that 33.4% you mention?  Yes, it seems the Speed6 was a much more competent effort than the 3.0 Ford V6.  Mazda sets \\'sales records\\' only because of some non-Japanlike discounting, whether the divison makes any real money is dubious at bestFor the 2007MY, Mazda\\'s discounting is similar to that of Honda/Toyota/Nissan. Keep in mind, Honda/Toyota/Nissan/Mazda disounting plans are devised by their North American opperations team, not headquarters in Japan. You have to look at how these companies do business in Japan to see what the \"Japan-like\" business tactics really are. Can you show any proof of that?MY2006 Mazda sales figures/profits here...http://www.mazda.com/publicity/release/2007/200704/070427f.html  The current Civic DX and LX have a one-piece folding rear seat, according to Honda:http://corporate.honda.com/press/article.aspx?id=2005083038429So that is something that the new Accord shares with the Civic. Although at least with a Civic, you can get a 60/40 rear seat if you move up to the EX or Si trim levels.The \"shot\" was saying I wouldn\\'t understand why an automaker would put 5 speeds rather than 4 speeds into a transmission. That is another way of calling someone an idiot.  Since Accord hasn\\'t had split folding rear seats, at least for three generations now, but Civic has had it, it is only logical to say Civic is more Accord-like than otherwise. But you won\\'t get it, would you? The \"shot\" was saying I wouldn\\'t understand why an automaker would put 5 speeds rather than 4 speeds into a transmission. That is another way of calling someone an idiot.If that is the only you way you can look at the argument. But as far as I\\'m concerned, most people don\\'t have a clue about transmissions and how they work. That doesn\\'t make them idiots, it makes them less informed (not quite the same thing, is it?).  The \"shot\" was saying I wouldn\\'t understand why an automaker would put 5 speeds rather than 4 speeds into a transmission. That is another way of calling someone an idiot. Glad you agree the domestic companies are \"idiots\" for those who are still using 4 speed automatics in their 4 cylinder vehicles (or even worse with V6 motors).  It seems to be a problem handed down from Aura. Is Malibu getting the 3.6?  Are there really car buyers who think \"I sure wish this car had big intrusive hinges, instead of struts...I just know those struts are going to break\"?  This discussion came around last week when a friend of mine who has arthritis had borrowed my Accord for a day while her Jetta was in the shop. Later in the evening she was telling me that the Accord\\'s trunk was so much easier for her to operate. I told her why it was. And then also told her that struts can fail to boot to which she responded that she had to get one replaced in her Jetta (which is just a 2002 model).If there were more who analyzed things like I do, we won\\'t be having this discussion. And this is the car that helped me learn a few things (Lexus GS)...  Please re-read my post--that\\'s not what I said, or implied, at all.  So with the 6-speed automatic available in the I4 Aura and also, early next year, in the I4 Malibu, does that make automakers like Honda \"idiots\" for only offering 5 speeds?  While driving back to Dallas from Houston over the weekend, I noticed three 1990-1993 generation Accords over a short distance and that got me into thinking about longevity of cars. I can&#146;t recall the last time I saw a Camry from that era, and in fact, 1993-1996 Camry has become a rare thing too despite of being a high volume seller in its day. OTOH, 1990+ Accords are very easy to find on the roads, and mid-90s Taurus is too, as are mid-late 90s Maximas. I don&#146;t expect to see many Sonatas either but they can get the benefit of doubt for being low volume sellers.I would like to see the percentage of cars still on road that have been sold since 1990. Anybody knows a credible source?  Yes. That is one area I have been complaining about from Honda. They have been selling 6AT in European Civic which has the same engine as American version, just haven\\'t considered it yet for American market in any of its cars.But at the same time, I don\\'t want Honda to put a 6AT for namesake (that would be simply to appeal to less than informed buyers). When they do, it needs to be the real thing. The best candidates for it are 190 HP Accord I-4, and to some extent, the Accord V6.Interestingly enough, I feel Honda could stick better 5AT ratios in Accord than they have, and have it even better than some 6ATs being sold in front drivers.With powerful front drivers, it is more difficult to extract the full potential of 6AT.  OTOH, 1990+ Accords are very easy to find on the roads, and mid-90s Taurus is too, as are mid-late 90s Maximas. I think this is very regional. I see a lot of 90-93 Accords on the road but they are starting to lack rear quarter panels. I actually did well selling mine because being from California, it had no rot.The Taurus with the Vulcan V6 will run forever, even the A4OD was somewhat under-stressed by that application. The later 3.8L was a motor that had a lot of longevity as well.  I see lots of Camrys from the \\'92-\\'96 generation, probably more than any other mid-sized car from that era, and lots of Buicks--many even from the \\'80s. Lots of Taurii from \\'95-on. I also see some \\'90-93 Accords, but like you I see a lot of rust on those. Lots of \\'94-97 Accords out there, they don\\'t seem to have been hit by the rust bug as much.  Maybe you guys remember me posting pictures from being clipped on the interstate over the summer. Did a nice sum of damage, and I got my car back not too long ago (maybe 1,000 miles?). Well, I got rear-ended today, once again, in my 1996 Accord. That brings the total number of incidents (none of which I caused or was found at fault for) to FIVE in that car. None in my new one thank-the-lord.I\\'m beginning to think my beloved 12 year old Honda has a curse. Either that, or a magnet, which draws other cars to me! Luckily, I\\'m ok, and the damage is minor, but once again I get to play the \"deal with their insurance company\" game. UGH!  Glad you\\'re fine. It sucks to be in that situation.   Yep, just lucky to have my 2006 while that one is in the shop. I\\'m actually thinking of selling old faithful (she needs some work that will be expensive - timing belt at $650 plus struts which would cost $800+ I\\'ve been told). Maybe when I get \\'er fixed I\\'ll put the sign in the window. I can\\'t promise I won\\'t cry though   I think guys driving domestics are jealous of the \"last and run forever\" Honda\\'s and try to play target practice on them with the \"won\\'t run for long\" domestics they have. :P So you better crash um while you still can! :P They try to run the Honda\\'s into the junkyard due to collisions.My GF got rearended by a Taurus and a Jetta in her Civics.I got rear ended by a Mustang in my Accord.I\\'ve never hit anyone else\\'s vehicle excluding hits under 3 MPH.  My experiences belie yours. I got hit by a Honda Pilot this time. The time before, I was clipped by a man in a 1988 Chevrolet S-10 Pickup - proving they can run for an awful long time too. He was going 75-80MPH, so he wasn\\'t pushing it in the slow-lane.  yeah right - just a few weeks back one Mazda dealer (Houston) was offering all 6s in stock at $6000.00 off MSRP. On a %20k sticker that would only be about $4k UNDER invoice! (including the rebate/financing that naturally went along with it.)The day that Camcords (even on model year changeovers sell for that kind of price - the same day that the sun rises in the west! Toyota and Honda would literally disinfranchise any of their dealers caught doing such thing - perserving the brand\\'s value now and later is THAT important, to both them and to those that invested in one of those particular cars.  My Accord was about 4.5-5k under MSRP. I cannot imagine anyone paying sticker price for that car, ever.  Which Accord was that? When did you buy it? I can see dealers going a few hundred dollars below invoice during year end clearance, but thousands? Well...  FYI - and I would hope that everybody knows this - \\'invoice is about MSRP * .9 on about all cars made. Factory options tend to work on or about a .85 muliplier, dealer options - is \\'Katy bar the door\\' Once saw a new Camry SE on a lot with 19\" tire and wheels - looked horrible and drove even worse. Dealer price for the tires/wheels? How about $8000.00, for maybe 1500 or 2000 \\'worth\\' of stuff. Wonder how much \\'discount\\' I could have gotten on that one? Paying sticker for a car - you only do that when the car you want is in very high demand, you haven\\'t done any research, and you probably can\\'t find any in dealer inventories.  little known to many buyers is that amongst the dealers they can tell you almost precisely what the other guy is likely to do pricewise. A dealer out there cutting prices significantly will likely incur the wrath (and non-cooperation) of those neighboring dealers and also might just receive a \\'nasty\\' letter from the distributor/mfgr.  2007 Honda Accord EX Purchased end of July, 2007 MSRP 23,145 (invoice is right around 21k) Purchase Price 19,000+ mask, \"mud guards,\"and trunk mat. I still think I overpaid, and I think I could\\'ve found a better vehicle for me for 19k, but alas, I can learn about the great resale value in 18-24 months.  What better car could you have found than an 07 EX Accord for 19k? What a great deal!  Thanks, I appreciate that.  Did my parents put you up tio that? :P And I think it is a great car for most people. It gets good mileage, does a great job with an infant seat, and has a good sized usable trunk. It should also hold its value pretty well.I think a Mazda6 Touring with the V6 and a 5 speed manual would have been more my cup of tea and in the same price range more/less. Or a Legacy turbo sedan (but we already have a wagon and don\\'t know if I can\\'t deal with having 2 similar cars).I guess what I really should\\'ve done is looked harder for an \\'06 Mazda6 or Legacy GT in the 10-15k range, or a certified E46 3-series.  Or, perhaps an optioned-out Sonata Limited.Our Sonata SE (V6, like the Limited) 8 months ago was $16,651 plus doc fee, reg & taxes was $18,189. The Limited was about $2K MSRP higher (car price would have been about $18,500 before doc & TTL).Nothing wrong with your choice, just that there are alternatives which could give one more for one\\'s money.

Nah, no manual transmission in the V6, it was never on the list and the dealer only had the very base 4 cylinder with a manual (same with the Fusion).  I think you paid about the same as I got my mazda6 hatchback. The Accord definately has the better manual tranny and I\\'d give it the edge in seat comfort and interior looks. But I do love how my mazda6 can mix practicality, comfort, and fun driving dynamics. Hatchbacks are so handy for tossing in large items... it\\'s proven to be very useful on many occasions. While being very practical, I also find the mazda to be the most fun to drive. It\\'s likely true the 0-60 times are a few tenths slower (the mazda does this in the mid-6 second range), but the steering and braking and handling seem so much more direct and controlled... for a person like me who likes to be entertained when the opportunity arises, it\\'s very nice. On top of all this, though, is that it\\'s still a very comfortable and ergonomic car to drive. All the buttons are where I would expect them and they even have a quality feel when pressing them. I\\'ve taken 4 hour trips in comfort and without pains in my body that I\\'d get from my Subaru (loved the Legacy, hated the seats!). It can be quiet and orderly when driven conservatively (like when I take my Grandmother out for dinner) and has a compliant suspension that dampens the irregularities of the road nicely. The amazing thing to me is how well it corners despite not having a harsh ride. When my uncle and I took the RX-8 for a test drive, he said that was what Mazda is known for... having a great handling chassis that doesn\\'t beat you up. To me, the Mazda6 is like a nicely dressed athlete with good manners and a willingness to help out with heavy lifting. But when asked, the car will respond in ways that make you remember why driving can be so fun. Edmunds\\' editors got it right when they picked the Mazda6 as the most desireable midsize car under 25k because it doesn\\'t make you compromise on things that make a car great. And saving $6k+ off MSRP is nice too :shades:  I\\'ll agree on the Vulcan 3.0 V-6 lasting forever BUT the 3.8 V-6 was/is a piece of crap. It had an immense amount of head gasket problems. Every year from its inception to its demise was affected...Ford never got it right. Head gaskets failed early and often. The dealer where I had our Taurus and Sables serviced had a dedicated tech. who replaced head gaskets and I always asked him how many miles on the current car he was working on. Most were less than 50K and some much less.  I\\'m beginning to think my beloved 12 year old Honda has a curse. Either that, or a magnet, which draws other cars to me! My 1991 Celica was the same way. I was rear ended, hit in the front passenger quarter panel twice, front driver corner and headlight, I hit a deer on the highway. By the time I got rid of it, my hood, front bumper, both quarter panels, trunk, rear bumper were all new! None of them were my fault, either. I traded it in, in 2002.  And saving $6k+ off MSRP is nice too sure is - but did you really \\'save\" anything close to your $6k, when you find out that it is worth about that much less a few years down the road. I know, everybody who will justify overly discounted prices with a claim that they will be hanging on to this one until the wheels fall off...  The \\'93 had 150k and 2 new wheel bearings, because well, I did just about drive the wheels off. :P  I guess he meant the 3.8 would last forever, provided you replace gaskets periodically  . Maybe they should just have just put it on the maintenace schedule, then itWe are the owners of a 3.8 (aka. sieve) in a Windstar. Luckily we were able to get all gaskets (not just the head gaskets) replaced for the cost of parts at a tech college. We were nearly at 100K mi. before they were a problem. What was most irrating is Ford recognized the problem but only if the engine were in certain vehicles...Taurus yes, F150 yes, Windstar no...just riduculous to claim that these same gaskets in the very same engine are or are not a problem based on which vehicle they stick the engine in.  just a few weeks back one Mazda dealer (Houston) was offering all 6s in stock at $6000.00 off MSRP. On a %20k sticker that would only be about $4k UNDER invoice! (including the rebate/financing that naturally went along with it.) So, you pick one Mazda dealer out of the over 800 dealers in the country to generalize how Mazda Motor Corp. runs their business, globally. Are you kidding me? Really....that makes no sense!!Do you know how that Mazda dealer is getting paid by Mazda? Maybe their stair step program gives them so much back end money, that selling high volume makes them more money, even discounting like that.Toyota and Honda would literally disinfranchise any of their dealers caught doing such thing - perserving the brand\\'s value now and later is THAT important, to both them and to those that invested in one of those particular cars.That is such BS. Honda and Toyota have no say in how any dealer franchise sells their vehicles. No say! Any dealer can sell any vehicle at any price they choose. They can ask more then MSRP, even though both companies do not condone it, and can sell below invoice, far below invoice if they want. Honda and Toyota do not tell their dealers \"Do not sell below invoice, or we will pull your dealer franchise\". That is some of the biggest nonsense I have ever heard.I know the owner or one of the biggest Honda dealers in the NY/CT area, and he buys his cars outright from Honda. He sells for invoice, and below on almost every Accord, to push volume. If he can make more, he does. Honda pays him $700/ car sold if he reaches his objective. Then, if his CSI is at a certain percentage, he gets even more money, an addition $500, I think per car. He sells over 200 new Hondas/month. That totals $240K/month. That does not even include his garenteed stair step money, which I do not know what it is, but, it\\'s a lot.  sure is - but did you really \\'save\" anything close to your $6k, when you find out that it is worth about that much less a few years down the roadJust out of pure curiosity, I took a look in the thread \"Prices paid and buying experience\" in the Honda Accord forum, and saw many people buying 2007 Accords for THOUSANDS below invoice. The highest one I saw was 6,800 off MSRP. Now, it\\'s either everyone in that forum is a liar, or Honda dealers are allowed to sell their vehicles at the price they want to, like I said they do.  If they had wanted MSRP (23,145) or invoice (~21k) for that Accord, I would\\'ve walked. I was close enough to walking at 19k.  as I said earlier somebody is looking west for the sun to rise - unless that $6800.00 off Accord had something like those $8000.00 wheels on it that\\'s when you buy a $25k Honda for $18k. And yes, of course, Honda dealers are allowed to sell their cars for whatever they want to (above and below sticker)- that\\'s exactly what Honda hdqtrs in Calif will tell you as well but whether you choose to believe it or not, they don\\'t - without the general knowledge (and agreement) of not only Honda but also \\'competing\\' dealers in the area. People seem to regard price paid for any car with a great deal of ego getting in the way, believe what you will, but I strongly suggest you really try to find that $18k ($25k sticker) Accord yourself first. Invoice on that car, is right at $22.5k - even a demo or a car that hasn\\'t sold for awhile because it has some strange option combos or colors etc. AND is last years model will not drive off a Honda (or Toyota) lot for anything aproaching $18k. Make it a Mazda/Ford or Hyundai lot, maybe - those cars have the resale values that testify to such shenanigans.  Mine has no dealer add ons except for the mask, mud guards and trunk mat. It didn\\'t even require haggling, just the Edmunds.com vehicle quote thing. Of course the Accord was only 4k off not 6k.  Make it a Mazda/Ford or Hyundai lot, maybe - those cars have the resale values that testify to such shenanigans. One cannot generalize an entire vehicle line to resale value. While the Mazda6 may have a lower resale value of an Accord, they are also less to begin with. The Accord does hold a slight resale advantage. A Mazda3 has virtually the same real world resale value of a Honda Civic. The Mazda MX-5 has a wicked high resale value, while say, the S2000 loses value quite quickly. Yes, the S2K is more of a car, but, is heavly discounted, and loses a lot of value in it\\'s first two years. The CR-V holds it\\'s value better then a Tribute, because the Tribute is a rebadged Escape.In my opinion, Toyota\\'s have a high book value, are are over rated. Yes, they are reliable. No question about it. However, interior materials recently seem to be low grade, with a low rent feel to them. Buttons and controls through out the line seem to have not changed since I owned my 1991 Celica. Actually, my Celica had better interior materials then the current Camry. Once again, this is my observation, and my opinion.  That is such BS. Honda and Toyota have no say in how any dealer franchise sells their vehicles.the \\'say\\' that they have is called allotments and also that cooperation between dealers when they trade off inventory to get you, me or anybody else exactly the car we want.That \\'BS\\', my friend, is how the car business really works and it is not like the dealer actually makes any real money selling you that new car in the first place even inclusive of holdbacks, mfgr volume/financing incentives, etc.- it takes a service dept and a used car lot to do that  > no dealer add ons except for the mask, mud guards and trunk matHow much were the mask, mud guards, and trunk mat?  That \\'BS\\', my friend, is how the car business really works and it is not like the dealer actually makes any real money selling you that new car in the first place even inclusive of holdbacks, mfgr volume/financing incentives, etc.- it takes a service dept and a used car lot to do thatUnless you\\'ve owned a dealership I don\\'t think you\\'re qualified to make those statements.  only about my closest friend who happens to own Ford, Nissan and Toyota franchises - all in the same area - (which are very hard to get BTW), and yes he is doing much better since he got the Ford portion of his complex open - loves the \\'fix or repair daily\\' income ggenerated by that service dept.   the \\'say\\' that they have is called allotments and also that cooperation between dealers when they trade off inventory to get you, me or anybody else exactly the car we want. Mfg\\'s have an allocation method based on your location, average sales, whether the dealer is exclusive or not. There are many factors that determine allocation, and every mfg is different. However, it is highly unusual that if a dealer sells a vehicle under invoice, it will affect future allocations.That \\'BS\\', my friend, is how the car business really works and it is not like the dealer actually makes any real money selling you that new car in the first place even inclusive of holdbacks, mfgr volume/financing incentives, etc.- it takes a service dept and a used car lot to do that More so service as the gravy, but there is money to be made in the sales end. Used cars are gravy as well, not to mention the finance department too. Holdback is not profit.BTW, I am a dealer, I know how the business works   loves the \\'fix or repair daily\\' income ggenerated by that service dept. Our Ford franchise is the same. My friends Honda dealer is also butter is the service dept.  actually a transparent\\' attempt (lame?) on my part to get akirby\\'s (our resident FoMoCo shill) dander up.The real reason why the guy wanted so badly to get his Ford dealership up can be spelled F150 and is obviously a function of volume.  C\\'mon, the purpose of this discussion is not to irritate others. Please knock it off.  However, it is highly unusual that if a dealer sells a vehicle under invoice, it will affect future allocations. didn\\'t exactly say that did I? What I did say was that any dealer that continually undersells what any vehicle\\'s market price is doing neither himself, his competing dealers (in effect, his family), existing owners or the mfgr. any kind of service. A company like Honda understands this as well, and values the history of high resale values that Hondas have traditionally enjoyed and the fact that this, as well, is part of the attraction of the product in the first place. What better way to \\'penalize\\' that offending dealer than to limit his selection of cars coming out of the factory and/or for those other Honda dealers to refuse his request for inventory trade outs when the need arises. And I think you would understand all this if you really are a dealer (wink-wink).Things like this is common practice even outside the auto business, talk to somebody you know that sells Sony products, and other mfgrs. that don\\'t even like to see their own products advertised at discounted pricing - for example.  And saving $6k+ off MSRP is nice toosure is - but did you really \\'save\" anything close to your $6k, when you find out that it is worth about that much less a few years down the road. I know, everybody who will justify overly discounted prices with a claim that they will be hanging on to this one until the wheels fall off...That may or may not be true... my early research on Kelly Blue Book indicated that the resale value of my Mazda6 after a bit more than a year was very high. But I didn\\'t buy a car as an investment so much as a means to an end. Of course I need a car for work and getting things done, but I also wanted something fun and expressive. After test driving many cars in this class, I know I bought the elite in handling and braking which are qualities that make the Mazda6 fun and safe to me. And knowing that I am a bit more self sufficient since I can put a 42\" plasma, coffee table, lawn mower or high-backed queen bedframe in the back of my car instead of calling for help is worth quite a bit. Who knows, maybe in the future, people will value the utility of hatchbacks more and make my car worth more. Or maybe it\\'s timeless good looks will attract buyers that will let it\\'s resale value remain very solid as it was when I checked Kelly Blue Book a few months ago... But even if it turns out to be not as good as it\\'s peers on this aspect, my Mazda6 will retain a high level of value to me and that is far more important since whatever car I buy, I\\'ll be taking a bath when I sell it several years down the road.  the Mazda6 resale values figure to plummet as soon as they start being purchased at $6k off. The same would apply to the Accord, if the same thing is happening. Resale is directly related to cost new, obviously, and more so in those first few years of any car\\'s useful life - and anything that loses value every year you own it never figures to be an \\'investment\\'. The 6 seemed to take a rather sudden turn downward in terms of market pricing recently - selling originally at something about invoice and later getting discounted/rebated well below that. Don\\'t know if this was due to FoMoCos influences (they certainly need all the cash they can get) or simply the case of a slow selling model and supply outrunning demand.  PS - truly getting KBB trade in value on anything is a novel concept (unless you allow them to \\'adjust\\' your purchase price), especially on something like a 6. Try it, suggest you won\\'t the numbers even be close, giving you the more reason to hang to the one got.  the Mazda6 resale values figure to plummet as soon as they start being purchased at $6k off.

Resale is directly related to cost new, obviously, and more so in those first few years of any car\\'s useful life - and anything that loses value every year you own it never figures to be an \\'investment\\'.I don\\'t think that is true. The 2002 Civic SIs were dogs from a sales standpoint (my friend bought a new one in Nov of \\'03) and he got very close to what he paid for it when he sold it to get a MazdaSpeed6. Blips in marketing don\\'t seem to affect long term retail pricing. Long term fire-sales of non-competitive vehicles is different, but that is not the case with the Mazda in question, either.  following that logic then one could buy a new Mazda6 that has a MSRP of let\\'s say $26k for $20k, drive it for a few thousand miles and sell it for something more than what you paid for it. Ain\\'t gonna happen simply because somebody out there is gonna know what the new one actually sells for. Whether what has happened to the 6s pricing is \\'a long term fire sale\\' - now that I think is debatable, there have been some steep discounts available on that particular car for some time now, establishing a bad precedent for those buyers of a new redesigned model, who would logically have to pay about $24k for that same car. Such a thing that Hyundai faces with its pretty decent Sonata, and may continue to face until it stops offering the same sort of \\'discount\\' structure\\'. Beware of big discounts as a general rule they are indicative of specific models that nobody wants (for whatever reason), poor resale values AND will also only tend to represent that amount of savings in the unlikely event that the car in question is kept for an abnormally long time.  If your claims on prices you paid is true, you couldn\\'t be luckier for getting a car that holds resale better than any other in its class. Perhaps you should sell it and make a few bucks. That doesn\\'t happen with \"new cars\".   following that logic then one could buy a new Mazda6 that has a MSRP of let\\'s say $26k for $20k, drive it for a few thousand miles and sell it for something more than what you paid for it. Ain\\'t gonna happen simply because somebody out there is gonna know what the new one actually sells for.Actually that seems to be what happened with the MazdaSpeed6, people are asking more for them then some of them sold for originally. Similarly with the \\'02 Honda Civic SI.  If your claims on prices you paid is true, you couldn\\'t be luckier for getting a car that holds resale better than any other in its class. Perhaps you should sell it and make a few bucks. That doesn\\'t happen with \"new cars\".You know, the more people tell me stuff like that, the more I feel better about the purchase, but hopefully what you mention will hold true and I can sell/trade it for something more fun sooner rather than later.  Instead of complaining, do it now! You can\\'t wait, could you?   Instead of complaining, do it now! You can\\'t wait, could you?I figure I have to wait at least a year. Its a perfectly fine car, I just don\\'t care for the driving experience. I am picky, I would consider myself an automotive enthusiast, and I don\\'t represent the general market. I am happy that it sounds like I won\\'t take too much of a financial hit from my mis-step.If my wife didn\\'t like her car as much as she does, I could just give it to her.I think I would like the car a lot with better shocks/springs/tires/wheels, but that comes out to $3-4k that will actually hurt the re-sale value of the car, so I will leave it as is and try again in a year or so.In the meantime, it got 33 mpg on the last tank.   the MazdaSpeed6, people are asking more for them then some of them sold for originally.I\\'m with Robert why should I have to work for a living when really all I have to do is buy and sell used Mazdas! You make life so simple, buy Mazdas, make money and drive a different car every week. Actually, TMBK the only \\'mass produced\\' car that this kind of thing has even come close to happening to in recent history - with was the Prius back when there was a 6 month waiting list to get one.  Honestly not trying to pump up Mazda, but how about the Miata when it first came out? Or the S2000? Or anything that had a \"Dealer Market Adjustment Sticker\" that people actually paid?  PS - truly getting KBB trade in value on anything is a novel concept (unless you allow them to \\'adjust\\' your purchase price), especially on something like a 6. Try it, suggest you won\\'t the numbers even be close, giving you the more reason to hang to the one got.I did try it actually, and got KBB\\'s price when I sold my Subaru. Yeah, ok KBB is only a guide and market conditions will vary from one place to another and from one buyer or seller to another. But it is the best guide we have which is why you\\'ll find a Kelly Blue Book in every bank and car lot. But for me to trust you over KBB is asking a lot since I think KBB would know this part of the business better than most people. But again, if you read what I wrote, I like my car and it has a lot of value to me as is. It drives very well and can transport things that most other cars in this class could not. Plus I think it looks better. No matter what car you buy in this class, if you buy new and sell it several years later, you\\'re gonna lose a ton of money. So, may as well buy something you like and can use to its fullest and I find the Mazda6 fits my needs and wants better than any other car in this class, so that\\'s what\\'s important to me.  I think KBB would know this part of the business better than most people. I would disagree. KBB is not in the car business. They do not buy, or sell cars. KBB is a publisher. They make money offering you free estimates on vehicles by having sponsors on their site. What reputable company do that? KBB is rather a slim guide line to follow. I have never sold a vehicle for what KBB says it\\'s worth. There is also no \"send check\" button to click once you got an appraisal on your vehicle.  while I agree with your comments on the accuracy of their numbersw (in general) in their defense how on earth could KBB or NADA (or anybody) anticipate that the market for 6s would get so bad that $6k discounts would have to be offered and those resale values would necessarily decrease by a similar amount?  Are custom fabric/vinyl roofs coming back? Today I saw a greyhaired lady driving an Azera with one. An Azera. Not a Caddy or a Lincoln. An Azera. Last week I saw a Milan with one.  Are you in Florida? If that\\'s the case then I am not surprised. During my 1-year stay in Melbourne, FL I saw at least one Camry (or Avalon) with vinyl roof every single day.If I am Toyota, I\\'ll hunt down the dealer who does this and burn its franchise agreement on the spot.  how on earth could KBB or NADA (or anybody) anticipate that the market for 6s would get so bad that $6k discounts would have to be offered and those resale values would necessarily decrease by a similar amount? Other then that one Texas dealer you told me about, I have not seen $6K in discounts. I am a Mazda dealer, and I would be losing major money if I sold them at discounts like that. Maybe that dealer has some spectacular payment plan, but, that is definitely not the norm. One dealer out of 800 does not set the value of the Mazda6 line as a whole.If you take a 2007 Mazda6 i Sport Value Edition, it has roughly a $1,300 mark up. Selling one at invoice plus the just introduced rebate of $2000, that is a $3,300 discount. I have yet to go below invoice, but, if I did, we are talking a couple hundred, not $2,700. I recently put in an internet request to a local Honda dealer about a 2007 Honda Accord, and this was the response I got, with NO negotiating. \"2007 Honda Accord SE sdn MSRP $22,370 our special internet price is $19,990. 2007 Honda Accord LX MSRP $21,670 our special internet price is $19,290\" We are talking about discounts at around $2,400. Not too far off from what the Mazda6\\'s are selling for around my area.Are there people out there that are going to get better then $3,300 off MSRP on a Mazda6? Probably. Are there people that are going to get more then $2,400 off MSRP on an Accord? Probably, infact, I believe lilengineerboy got his for way more off then that.I know that real publications that offer real world values to pre-owned vehicle, such as Galves and Black Book, set their values at what one can expect to get for the vehicle if you were to purchase or sell it at an auction. Since Honda has built a great reputation for dependability and reliability, their 4 cyl products tend to hold value longer then most brands. I have noticed their V6 models take bigger hits in value, rightfully so due to the recent problems with them. Also, I do believe mfgr incentives have a say in the auction value in the most recent year, not actually what dealers sell them for. It is well known that the biggest depreciation is applied in the first two years. Anyone who wants to trade out during that time frame will get killed, no matter what you drive. From what I have seen, most people trade out of vehicles when mileage goes over 70K. At that point, many Japanese brands have values so close to one another, and the difference is minimal. There will be a bigger difference in value, for example, a 2002 Mazda/Nissan vs 2002 American equal then between a 2002 Honda/Toyota and 2002 Mazda/Nissan.  My 2003 Accord V6 Coupe sold for 53% of its out the door cost of when I bought it. This was 50 months and 65,000 miles later. It works out to a cost of $235/month. Not too shabby.  I see quite a bit in the North. And, quite a few were Milans - both to my surprises.  KBB is not in the car business. They do not buy, or sell cars. KBB is a publisher. They make money offering you free estimates on vehicles by having sponsors on their site. What reputable company do that?You\\'re in the car business so I\\'m sure you know more about how accurate KBB is... I\\'m sure KBB is just a guide, kind of like the weatherman. Thing is, even though the weatherman is often wrong, I still listen cuz it\\'s better info than what I could usually come up with on my own. How long has KBB been around anyway? I\\'m sure they were around before the internet was big... long enough to have a decent level of credibility anyway. If they were a total joke and just randomly fixed values to cars who would go to their site? Nobody, which would mean zero ad revenue. Now I\\'m not saying KBB is totally accurate... I\\'m sure there are many instances where it\\'s a bit off. But I don\\'t think they randomly choose numbers either. So they are a referrence point that many people use when buying or selling a car... As an individual who is not in the car business, how would I ever know what a car is worth were it not for resources like KBB? Am I to go to the nearest car lot and trust what they tell me? Or should I ask captain2 since he seems to know exactly how much I could sell my car for?  Leave it to Honda to show us how to do more with less\"Make no mistake: the Honda Accord is a terrific automobile no matter how it comes, but it also compels us to consider something we don&#146;t think about too often: at what point does horsepower become truly superfluous? Especially as fuel efficiency and low emissions, both longstanding hallmarks of the Honda brand, become more important than ever before, we are looking for cars that are both fun to drive and easy on the earth.We just found one.\"  In fact, with a starting price of $20,995, the Accord is the least expensive full-size automobile available today. We&#146;re sure that&#146;s no accident, as size matters in America as it does in no other country in the world.I think they left out the $17k Sonata...dummies!  I think they left out the $17k Sonata...dummies!Is the Sonata officially full-size though? The Accord sedan (coupe is shorter) just hit the magic number to be classified as such but IIRC the sonata is a couple of inches shorter which keeps it in mid-sized land. No?If I were shopping for a full-sizer, the Accord would be at the bottom of my list. Have you ever seen the room inside the cabins and trunks of the Accord\\'s competitors, Taurus and Avalon? They rival some living rooms I\\'ve been in. :P  Is the Sonata officially full-size though? From all the sources I\\'ve seen, yes.  I\\'ve been a subscriber to most auto enthusiast magazines for over 30 years, 40 in the case of Road & Track. My profession is magazine publishing, not on the editorial side of the ledger, but the business side (display advertising). Although ideally there is supposed to be a definitive line of demarcation between editorial and advertising in the print media business, the reality is more pragmatic - advertising, and the amount a company places in a magazine, does certainly impact editorial.If Honda, or Hyundai, Toyota, etc., would pull its display advertising from C&D, it would be interesting to see what they would have to say about any, or all, of their vehicles.Given my experience, I would not take anything written in advertising-supported print media as gospel. FWIW, news stand and subscription sales of major monthly consumer magazines pay for the only the fixed cost administrative and production expenses. Without display advertising revenue, the magazine(s) would cease publication.  Bingo. While we sit here discussing models and proclaim one is \"better\" than the other, there are a bunch of numbers known as sales figures that really tell the story.For example, it is said the Sonota is a \"better value\" than the Accord, but when will America wake up and realize this?  Is the Sonata officially full-size though?EPA certified since 2005:http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/2008car1tablef.jsp?column=1&id=24057  Are there people out there that are going to get better then $3,300 off MSRP on a Mazda6? Probably. I am one who did, I got about $5000 off on a sport value automatic (this included a $2000 rebate) back in Jan. If like me, one is able to get a better than average discount on a car this reduces the depreciation. I paid $16,124 (after adding back in document fee) for a car where the average deal is perhaps more like $18,000??? If the average depreciation is 1/3 in the first two years, the car would then be worth $12,000. This would mean my depreciation would be around 25%. Also my loss of value would be \"only\" about $4000 vs. the typical $6000. Not that I plan to sell anytime in the next decade, anyway  .The particular deal one gets can have more impact on one\\'s personal depreciation than whatever the average depreciation figures show. I am pretty sure I will lose less to depreciation on my Mazda6, than I would have had I gotten an average deal on an Accord...of course a lilengineerboy discount on an Accord would be a different matter.  So are we now accepting EPA\\'s decree on the size class of cars? If so, Pontiac G6, Accord coupe, and Subaru Legacy are compact not midsize.  It\\'s always been EPA. We are talking about dimensions - usable space (size class), not market class.  :confuse: EPA size class is compact for the cars I listed.  Better value generally only translates to sales leader for commodity items. Car buyers never buy on price alone. Well, almost never - I did know ONE guy that did many years ago. Even value minded car buyers have subjective preferences for styling, features and performance.  And?The C/D article had the Accord as a full-sizer, according to EPA. thegraduate and I pointed out the Sonata is also classified as full-size per EPA.  And...who cares what EPA \"size class\" is. It is a silly way to classify cars. The only purpose of that is to decide which vehicles are included on the mpg sticker for comparison.Maybe my point about the cars classified as \"compact\" was too subtle or do you argree with EPA that the those vehicles are compacts? Does the Legacy compete with the Accord (sedan) or the Civic...or maybe neither...or maybe only with the Accord Sedan sans sunroof? How about the G6...does it compete with the midsize (and kinda similar  ) malibu or the compact Cobalt?  I\\'ve heard that one before. So, what did you disagree with in that test drive? Other than two errors I noted. One, Accord V6\\'s pre-PZEV rating was 273 HP which they have stuck with, PZEV version is 268 HP). And two, they forgot Sonata is another full size car. But perhaps because, Sonata is a forgettable car? :P J/k. I appreciate its qualities, and I\\'m sure it works well for a lot of folks. But it doesn\\'t appeal to me. And I think C&D is one of the rare automotive source that actually knows a thing or two about cars, or it might be because I too see some of the things that they note in their tests. Must be in the driving style.  Maybe my point about the cars classified as \"compact\" was too subtle or do you argree with EPA that the those vehicles are compacts? Does the Legacy compete with the Accord (sedan) or the Civic...or maybe neither...or maybe only with the Accord Sedan sans sunroof? How about the G6...does it compete with the midsize (and kinda similar ) malibu or the compact Cobalt?Actually, that raises a good point. The new Accord to me seems like the Avalon and Maxima, so I do consider them in another class. The old Accord (03-07) is noticeably bigger than the Legacy of the same time frame, but they might be close enough to be in the same category. How big is the Passat, that car seems huge to me as well. The G6 always seemed snugger than the Malibu, so maybe that difference is big enough to make the G6 compete with the Cobalt or maybe not. That doesn\\'t mean the car doesn\\'t have a place even if its closer to a smaller car. My Contour wasn\\'t much bigger than an Escort but I liked it a lot more.  Car buyers never buy on price alone.I start with an upper limit on price, and get the car that offers me the best combination of everything I care for. So, I don\\'t take price out of the picture, in fact it is the starting point to consider a bunch of options out there. I\\'m not one to compare a Mercedes E55 AMG to a mainstream family sedan. Price alone determines that. Next are the attributes of the car, again, within a price range.  I am in agreement with you. I merely posted the fact both the Sonata are Accord are classified as full-size. It should be noted, however, both still compete with others in the midsize family sedan category.  who cares what EPA \"size class\" is. It is a silly way to classify cars. I agree. EPA\\'s standard depends on standards used by automakers. And while cabin volume is measured based on legroom, headroom and shoulder room (the three are multipled, front and back, with inch converted to ft), trunk volume is something that doesn\\'t seem to follow a standard. Some use SAE method, others use VDA, and this little known fact creates discrepancies. Trunks perceived to be large may not really be larger. It would depend on the standard used by automakers.PS. SAE method uses fine grain substance/sand/water to fill up the space. The volume used is the specified volume. So this includes every nook and cranny (not necessarily usable space).VDA (Verband der Automobilindustrie) method uses standard size wooden block and depending on how many make it, their volume determines the volume of the space. This results in a lower number but is more indicative of \"useful space\".Edmunds has tried quoting both but they seem to have gotten the numbers mixed up. For example, they quoted 2008 Mercedes C350 as having 16.8 cu ft trunk under VDA (should be SAE) and 12.5 cu ft trunk under SAE (should be VDA). MB uses VDA method, as does Honda. Many European automakers will quote both. Others, one or the other.In this case (C350), VDA to SAE discrepancy is a whopping 34% (4.3 cu ft).  I merely posted the fact both the Sonata are Accord are classified as full-size. It should be noted, however, both still compete with others in the midsize family sedan category. All good to know. Well, at least for the crazies like us that post on these forums. That last sentence is why I said I\\'d consider the Accord last if I were shopping for a full-sizer. Even though the Taurus and Avalon are priced a bit higher they offer a lot more space which is why you would want a full-sizer in the first place most likely.  You\\'re in the car business so I\\'m sure you know more about how accurate KBB is... I\\'m sure KBB is just a guide, kind of like the weatherman. Thing is, even though the weatherman is often wrong, I still listen cuz it\\'s better info than what I could usually come up with on my own.I don\\'t fault anyone for listining to KBB, how can I? Even before I was in the biz, I thought they were accutate too! What is hard is convincing potential customers that KBB is inacurate, and they can only be used a slim guide line.  I merely posted the fact both the Sonata are Accord are classified as full-size.Accord is classified as midsize with sunroof and as full size without sunroof.  Accord is classified as midsize with sunroof and as full size without sunroof.and, don\\'t forget, it is classified by EPA as a compact in the coupe. Which I only point out to illustrate the silliness of relying on EPA to decide what class a car is in.Here\\'s more: Midsize per EPA includes Nissan Versa and Sentra...with the Altima that makes three.  The EPA classes can be of help in identifying cars to consider. For example, if someone is looking for the most room for their bucks, they could look at \"mid-sizers\" like the Versa, Sentra, and Elantra and \"full-sizers\" like the Accord LX and Sonata. But don\\'t forget those that are on the periphery. For example, the Optima is 1 whopping cubic foot less in volume than the full-sized Accord LX. The Camry is real close to the magic 120 cubic foot mark also. So the Optima and Camry are mid-sized per the EPA while the Accord LX is full-sized. But in terms of usable space, there\\'s not much difference.  When I was looking, I of course wanted adequate space to be comfortable in the front. Back seat comfort needed to only be basic... enough for leg room and elbow room for two 6 footers. More important to me was how the interior space could be configured for hauling things. Previously, I had a wagon and fell in love with it\\'s versatility. I wasn\\'t crazy about the looks of a wagon though (got sick of being called a soccer-dad), so when I found a Mazda6 hatchback, I was instantly intrigued. It looked as good as the sedan, in fact in some ways, I like it better. The hatch opening was huge which would allow putting in very large cargo very easy. The seats folded down extremely easily...from the rear bumper, there are two switches that when pulled, the spring loaded seats fall forward; from the rear doors, there are buttons by the headrest that also make the back seats fall forward. With the rear seats folded down, the floor was flat which was great for pushing boxes back without getting hung up when loading through the hatch. Mazda did a great job making space comfortable when transporting multiple people and also making the space cavernous and easily useable when needed to haul things around. And even better, they did all this while maintaining the Mazda6\\'s great looking exterior. They even put several tie down points which kept my lawnmower from rolling around when I took it into the shop... very smart. All this talk about EPA rated sizes was of little importance to me because it does not take into account of how space can be used The Mazda6 hatchback is a great example of how different ways of looking at how space can be better utilized can result in a much more handy product.  I agree, the Mazda6 hatch is a great package. I almost bought one back in 2004, but back then the discounts on the then-new hatch were almost nil, so even the 6i hatch cost a LOT more than the car I chose, an Elantra hatch (which isn\\'t a lot smaller in usable space). I hope Mazda offers the 2009 Mazda6 as a hatch in the U.S.  Well said. EPA does use a different classification for wagons (and yet another for light trucks) but then I don&#146;t know if a hatchback is classified under cars or wagons because it is an in-between thing.As far as EPA&#146;s definition is concerned, I&#146;m not sure of the real purpose. But if they must use a standard for whatever purpose, I think it should be based on a standard (as opposed to letting automakers use their own around cargo volume, payload, towing etc).  Actually, the thought of government agencies making random judgment calls that are seemingly based on nothing doesn\\'t bother me as much as the fact that all the ratings on passenger car tires are \"self evaluated\" by tire manufacturers and then used for marketing. Of course those ratings are based on more random government standards, but oh well.  Yea - OK - but you have no trunk. I\\'d rather isolate my stuff in a trunk than give it up for the one time in a hundred a hatch would be more convenient.  Items in Mazda6 Hatch are isolated. They are secure. You can not get into the hatch/trunk are without going thru the parcel shelf. Hatch has to be open in order to move the parcel shelf. Latches to move rear seatsbacks up is in hatch area and not in the passenger cabin.100 times out of 100 I have the option of greater utility than the sedan with \"trunk\".  Items in Mazda6 Hatch are isolated. They are secure.Yeah, OK. And there\\'s this bridge in Brooklyn you might be interested in....Hatchbacks are dead in America. Wonder why?  Hatchbacks are dead in America. Wonder why?\"SUVs\"... the new \"station wagon\".  Hatchbacks are dead in America. Wonder why? Ignorance!You should share your knowledge of hatchbacks being dead with-ToyotaNissanHondaScionSaabVolvoMINIDodgeMazdaPontiacHyundaiMitsubishiAudiSaturnVolkswagenSmart&SuzukiThey did not get the memo.  Hatchbacks are dead in America. Wonder why?Because they\\'re not. Here\\'s a partial listing of hatchbacks available now or that will be introduced soon. Automakers wouldn\\'t make all these hatchback models if there were no demand for them:Honda Fit* Nissan VersaMazda3* Mazda6Toyota YarisToyota Matrix* Toyota Prius* Scion xBScion xD* Hyundai Elantra Touring* Kia Spectra5Kia Rio5Suzuki RenoSuzuki SX4Audi A3MINI CooperChevy CobaltDodge CaliberPontiac VibeSaturn AstraSmart carsSubaru ImprezaVolkswagen RabbitVolvo C30(The ones with * are mid-sized per EPA stats.)  If I really needed a lot of interior storage space, I would have bought a CRV. I would not want something dirty, or smelly (lawn mower for instance) in the interior with me though. For things like this, and for larger objects (washer, dryer, fridge) that will not fit in a hatchback or SUV, I have a truck. No need for a hatchback, in my case.  True, a SUV or crossover would give me superior cargo carrying capacity. But an important characteristic that I was wanting besides a large cargo area was a car with good handling. With a higher center of gravity (which is why SUV\\'s are much more likely to get into a dangerous rollover than a car) handling is compromised too much to the point where I think I would be sacrificing both fun and safety. The unique appeal of the Mazda6 hatchback is that I can have great handling and lots of cargo space while still having a very nice looking exterior. To the people who have said that they don\\'t want to put dirty things in the hatch for fear of getting things dirty or making the inside smelly, I haven\\'t had that problem. Nor have most of my friends and family who have SUV\\'s to haul things around. It\\'s not that hard to wipe off a plastic, waterproof cargo mat. And as long as I\\'m not hauling manure around, it\\'s not going to smell that bad for long. Besides, I\\'ve discovered the wonderful Febreeze does wonders at freshening the inside of the car. Some may say, \"Well just buy another vehicle...\" Thing is, I spent the 4 thousand bucks I saved on my Mazda6 vs a comparibly equipped Accord or Legacy on a plasma HDTV, a DSLR camera, a high backed queen bed frame, a coffee table, car mounted gps, a portable DVD player, a queen mattress, and a years worth of car insurance (all of which fit in my hatchback btw :shades: except the queen mattress which came w/ free delivery anyway). Plus I don\\'t have a good place to park a truck, and I hate having trucks stacked outside my house (I think it looks not too good). And really, I\\'ve yet to need to borrow anyone\\'s truck for my needs since I\\'ve had my Mazda6 hatchback since everything I\\'ve wanted has fit in it which would suggest that I don\\'t need a truck...  So I was discussing my disappointment with some aspects of the Accord with one of my friends and he suggested the Acura TSX A-spec suspension components. He also mentioned the Acura crowd seems to go to a larger rear sway bar as well. I also found a Mugen short throw shifter, but I think its 6speed only. Is there a forum that discusses this type of thing?I think that would allow the car to remain mostly OEM but a lot more fun to drive.  Never-mind I found it and reposted  re 6296They are only \"dead\" to those who have never used them. Anyone who has owned a hatchback will almost always want to keep one. It is a shame that so many manufacturers would rather try to force their \"brilliant\" ideas on the customers, rather than listen to what they (customers) really want.van   I\\'d rather isolate my stuff in a trunk I always wonder what this sort of statement is about. The other one that I hear (and don\\'t really get) is that a trunk is \"more secure\". I have a sedan now as does my wife. But we have had a hatchback, a wagon, and a couple minivans in the past. I never recall wishing for a trunk, when we did not have one. I bought the maxda6 sedan over the hatch, because the price was $1000 lower, there was more headroom in the back seat, it came without a wing, and we expect our old minivan to be around for quite a while. What is it that you carry around that needs \"isolating\"? Honestly, I am curious about this because it seems to be a pretty common preference.  I totally understand what is meant. I had a hatchback and could hold a lot of stuff relative to the size of the car. But it had some downsides as well. I wouldn\\'t get another hatchback.  I totally understand what is meant. I had a hatchback and could hold a lot of stuff relative to the size of the car. But it had some downsides as well. I wouldn\\'t get another hatchback.Again I agree with KD. I wouldn\\'t want a hatchback on a midsize sedan. Maybe on something smaller like a Fit.  Thankfully, most manufactures thought of you (except for Toyota) by allowing you to get a hatchback, sedan, and occasionally a wagon in a midsize package. I think its kind of silly to say \"they shouldn\\'t make hatchbacks because I don\\'t want one.\" One buys a car based on their perceived needs and the perceived value of the vehicle. Sometimes its a matter of utility, sometimes its a matter of practicality, some times its image...it doesn\\'t matter.People don\\'t think midsized cars should be manuals, and thankfully for them, there are a plethora of lifeless slushboxes for them to choose from. For those that don\\'t like hatches, there are a number of other body styles.Until a few years from now when Toyota takes over the world and starts telling us what we want, there are enough options out there to keep most people relatively happy.  Does a CRV Zoom Zoom? Mazda6 handles better than any CRV or other SUV that I\\'ve driven. Why buy a SUV when a midsize car handles better, obtains better mpg, and costs less.I did not buy a midsize hatchback so I could haul lawn mowers or washers. It sure is nice when I was traveling and my wife wanted to buy a cedar chest. No problem hauling it in the 6 with the hatch closed. It would not have fit in a 6 with a trunk.Why buy a sedan Mazda6 over a hatchback Mazda6? I see no reason. Too bad there is not an Accord and Altima 5 door.  Does a CRV Zoom Zoom? The Mazda6 is a FWD midsize sedan, in case you\\'ve forgotten. It doesn\\'t handle like a true sports car will. A hatchback does not have the cargo capacity of an SUV/Crossover either. A pretender on both counts. So you really can\\'t have it all. I prefer to use a car for hauling people, and a truck for hauling large things. Hatchback? No thanks.  Why buy a sedan Mazda6 over a hatchback Mazda6? Because a hatchback doesn\\'t isolate nasty or smelly etc. cargo from the cabin like a trunk does. Dust from bags of concrete comes to mind. Or carry-out/doggy bags left in the car for a while. Or a gas can for the lawnmower. Or anything stinky or dusty or in disarray.Or anything __________________ (fill in the blank).  I prefer to use a car for hauling people, and a truck for hauling large things. Hatchback? No thanks. Is your dislike for hatchback subjective or objective?Using the example of Mazda6, Is there ANYTHING that sedan does better than hatch?Sedan does not secure or isolate cargo any better than hatch.Sedan does not handle better than hatch.Sedan is not quieter than hatch.Sedan does not get better mileage than hatch.  Actually, trunk and hatch isolates in the same way, with the seatbacks and with barrier between top of seatbacks and rear window. There is cover over the top of trunk contents, there is a cover over top of hatch contents.Do a smell test, or dust test, or anything _______________ (fill in the blank) and you will find out your bag of dogs smells the same in trunk or in hatch.  It\\'s not that I have a problem with a hatchback. It\\'s just that I don\\'t need one. I would not buy a particular car, because it has a hatchback version. That would limit your choices in this segment. If I could only have one vehicle, it would have to be a truck. If I buy a fridge or sofa, I want to haul it myself. A hatchback just can\\'t do that.  I\\'ve owned a couple hatchbacks and was always amazed by how much stuff one would haul. If we were all rich, we could just drive sports cars and hire someone with a truck to haul goods or a limousine to haul passengers for us. Many SUVs are just used as glorified station wagons. Hatchbacks are very common and much more popular in Europe (having lived there 5 years) than here because cost/size/efficiency is more critical there. The drawbacks I have noted in a hatchback include slightly more noise/rattle prone and slightly less rigid frame. Neither is a big deal. The Mazda6 hatch is a particularly nice-looking hatchback in my opinion. A hatch may not fit everyones\\' desires but it definitely has its advantages.  If I buy a fridge or sofa, I want to haul it myself. A hatchback just can\\'t do that. No, it can\\'t. But I can rent a truck for those rare times when I need one. The other 363-4 days a year, I prefer the handling and fuel economy of a sedan or hatchback--like the mid-sized sedans we are discussing here.  The pix posted earlier of the Mazda 6 Hatchback looked really good. I\\'ve also seen the previous gen. Elantra hatchback and it looks really good. These are not the hatchbacks of the early 80\\'s GM cars. They offer a nice choice in a mid size car. (My Sonata is, of course, a sedan.)  Do I sense a little hostility?Can I not mention why I personally don\\'t need a hatchback? Or why it just will not suffice, in my case? Most Americans do own trucks, and don\\'t need to haul things in their cars. Can I fit a sheet of plywood in it? Nope.  The Mazda6 is a FWD midsize sedan, in case you\\'ve forgotten. It doesn\\'t handle like a true sports car will. A hatchback does not have the cargo capacity of an SUV/Crossover either. A pretender on both counts. So you really can\\'t have it all.Yes it is a midsize sedan that is targeted at families who want comfort and practicality, so no it was never meant to be a true sports car. But as a midsize sedan, it handles better than the other cars in this class. As automobile.com writes, \"Grip is very, very good, tenacious you might say, right up to the point where the front end pushes, telling you to lighten up. And this doesn\\'t occur until you\\'ve reached competition-level speeds. Other mid-size sedans lose grip far sooner than the Mazda6.\" Even though I\\'ve owned this car close to a couple years now, I am still amazed at how well this car handles considering at how comfortable it is to ride in. I just took my grandmother to do some shopping today and never felt the ride would leave her feeling uncomfortable. In fact she commented that she found the seats very supportive and comfortable to ride in... Having a midsize car to me is about the mix of practicality, value, and still having a vehicle that can be fun to drive. That\\'s why I was not interested in buying a truck; it is neither practical (higher fuel costs, less comfort, harder to get around on congested roadways) nor fun to drive. If having a car that is fun to drive isn\\'t an issue, SUV\\'s, crossovers or even minivans really make more sense for people movers. But when it comes to midsize sedans, hatchbacks add an extra dose of practicality that your average family or individual can take advantage of which only adds to the value of a Mazda6 hatchback.  If you sensed hostility, it was just you... none was intended. There was in my post though a little reminder that this discussion is acout mid-sized cars, not trucks. Many of us need to occasionally haul big stuff like sofas or plywood. My choice was to go with a mid-sized car (hatch) and rent or borrow a truck when I need one--which is once or twice a year. You made a different choice. That\\'s all there is to it... no reason for hostility.  I need to buy a new car. Right now we have a 2006 Accord (4cyl) and an old, dying 1997 Nissan Sentra. The Sentra must go.More than anything, as boring as it may sound, we need reliability and longevity in whatever we buy (which is why we replaced our old, dying 1996 Mazda Protege with the Accord). I have been very pleased with the Accord so far, and I am now very enamored with the new Accord. I\\'m not that impressed with the Camry. Not sure why, I just don\\'t like the looks that much.Here\\'s my quandary: I don\\'t have enough auto perspective to know what we\\'re missing if we get another Accord. My wife doesn\\'t want a new Accord--she wants a Volvo. She doesn\\'t know much about cars, and doesn\\'t know much about Volvo, but she loves the idea of us having one. Trouble is, I don\\'t know why you buy a Volvo over an Accord. Why do you buy an S40 or C30 over an Accord? What does a Volvo give you? What about an Altima, or a Mazda6? Or hell, what about a Subaru? I just don\\'t know what the trade-offs are.  Read a lot of professional reviews and comparison tests first. This will give you a good idea which cars fit your wants and needs. They will usually point out the strong and weak points of each. Then use this information on test drives, to help you evaluate during what will probably only be a short drive around the block. It\\'s hard to get a lot from a test drive, if you have little to no information going in. You could rent the perspective cars for a few days, to get a better feel for them, but that would cost you. Good luck in your quest for the perfect car.   I agree with the above remarks. As you know Volvos have a much higher price range than these mid-size and more luxury and power, in the top end than these cars. However, in the price range of these vehicles $16K to $30K there is a lot of variation. You would have to drive the S40 to see how it stacks up with the Accord.So the best advice is to test drive and see what you like and don\\'t like. You can\\'t really go wrong with any car in this class, it\\'s all about what you like most and dislike least.  Why do you buy an S40 or C30 over an Accord? What does a Volvo give you?Buying a Volvo simply because it is a Volvo is a bad reason for purchase.I think you should first find out what particular type of car you want. Do you want a mid-size family sedan? Do you want a compact? Do you want something that impractical but fun? How much do you want to spend?The Volvo C30 is designed for people who want performance with some practicality. It has a great drive, but it\\'s not spectacular. It\\'s an overall great car. I loved its unique looks the minute I saw it. But I\\'d honestly rather have a Volkswagen GTI over it. It\\'s just as practical but it\\'s more fun to drive. (This is all my personal opinion of course).I think before you jump to other automakers. Find the type of car you want. Don\\'t badge shop. But a good suggestion before you make the big purchase is test drive all its competitors. If you\\'re looking for an Accord-sized car. Test drive the Sonata, Mazda6, Aura, Camry, Altima etc.  Beyond what other people have written (and I think ctalk nailed it best...) you have to know what characteristics your wife wants in a car before you can start to narrow down your choices. Volvo has a reputation for safety as well as being a brand that that sits solidly in the near luxury segment. Since she\\'s not too enamored with the Accord or Altima, I\\'d geuss she is somewhat conservative (likes to make safe choices), but likes nice things without being pompous or elitist like maybe a BMW or Mercedes could be interpreted. You haven\\'t mentioned if she is interested in a wagon or sedan, but if you have a need/want for extra cargo area, a Volvo may be a good choice. Although the Accord has become a bit more Camry like in it\\'s ride, it is a very nice car. I\\'m always a little wary of buying a brand new model though since all the wrinkles may not have been ironed out yet so if you can wait at least a few months, that would be best (you\\'ll also be able to get a much better deal on an Accord as I\\'ve heard the dealers aren\\'t willing to negotiate too much on them right now). If you can get over the kind of strange looking exterior, the Accord would make a great choice if you\\'re looking for something that is less fun but refined and don\\'t mind how common they are. One thing\\'s for sure though, if you try to impose your choice on her and something goes wrong... you\\'ll never hear the end of it. So try to make this a learning experience for both of you and let knowledge guide your decisions.  \"Since she\\'s not too enamored with the Accord or Altima\"That\\'s not what the post read. The sentence was: \"My wife doesn\\'t want an Accord, she wants a Volvo\". The clearly doesn\\'t suggest she\\'s not enamored with an Accord but more enamored with the Volvo.\"One thing\\'s for sure though, if you try to impose your choice on her and something goes wrong... you\\'ll never hear the end of it.\"What is even worse is to let a decision be made without thorough follow up. If the wife makes the decision and it turns out to be wrong, it\\'s a costly mistake. IMO, the best way to do it, is to make a joint decision, which probably what it will turn out to be anyway.Although, the flip side is, there probably is no wrong decision, Accord, Altima, Volvo...etc. They all have their strenghts as well as their weaknesses.A Volvo is not a bad car, heck they sell enough of them. I wouldn\\'t get one...it\\'s not quite my style, but there are a lot of them on the road and they have reputation the Duracell bunny would envy in terms of longevity.  One thing you didn\\'t tell us is, who will be the primary driver of your new car? If it\\'s your wife, then she should have the main input into the decision. But encourage her to take a look at other options than just the Volvo. It\\'s a big decision and one you will both need to live with for several years. The S40 and C30 are relatively small cars, compacts vs. the mid-sized or even full-sized (in interior room) cars we\\'re discussing here. The mid-sized Volvo is the S60, which is pretty expensive compared to cars like the Accord, Mazda6, and Altima.Has your wife seen and driven the new Accord, to know why she doesn\\'t like it? If not, encourage her to do so, with an open mind. It\\'s an excellent car and probably just as safe as a Volvo--if that is why she likes Volvos. And it\\'s likely to be more reliable. It also has more of a European look to it than the 2007 Accord--if that is what she is basing her opinion on.If she is not familiar with the other cars you mentioned, e.g. Altima, Mazda6, and Subaru (Legacy?), maybe you could ask her to take a Saturday with you and drive some cars. It\\'s fun, and will open her eyes to other alternatives. The Mazda6 for example could be considered a big cousin of the S40, since the S40 is based on the Mazda3 platform. The Mazda6 is available in a sleek hatch, if she likes hatches ala C30. She might really like the new Altima coupe--very sporty looking, yet economical with the I4. The Accord coupe is pretty sporty looking, also. And if she\\'s into safety, she might like the Subaru with its AWD.There\\'s several other good choices in this class. You might sound her out as to how she would feel being seen driving a Korean car. If she is against that idea, don\\'t waste your time looking at the Optima and Sonata, but if she\\'s open to it take those for a drive; they represent excellent value in this class. Some people really like the styling of the Fusion; it\\'s based on the Mazda6 platform. If she\\'s open to driving a domestic car like the Fusion, you could check out its twin the Milan and also the Aura, which is getting many positive reviews. The Passat is also well-regarded, if pricey, but will probably not be as reliable as others in the class such as the Accord. But it too offers excellent safety, ala Volvo.In the end, get something your wife really wants to drive. I made the mistake once of getting a car that was a very practical and logical decision, but after a couple of years it was clear my wife really missed having a minivan. So now she has one, albeit a smaller one than she had before, and she loves it.  Thanks all for the feedback. Very helpful, and there\\'s no doubt we need to go drive some cars. To answer a few questions and clarify some things that have been asked:- We haven\\'t actually decided who would drive this car. She\\'s had the Accord now while I\\'ve driven the little Sentra (I have the shorter and easier commute), so I sort of want the new car, but we\\'ll see. It will ultimately be a joint decision.- She doesn\\'t dislike the new Accord, it\\'s just that it\\'s an Accord and she wants something \"different\". I\\'ve told her how different the new one is, but it still says \"Accord\" so she still feels the same.- She\\'s not set on Volvos, she just really wants a \"luxury nameplate. Given our other financial obligations right now, and the very high quality of non-luxury cars like Hondas and Toyotas, I don\\'t see the point. - Actually, that distinction was part of what was driving my original question--what does a low-end luxury car give you that wouldn\\'t be trumped by a loaded high-end non-luxury car? Why buy a low-end Acura TSX when they could get a somewhat loaded Accord for the same money? I\\'m sure there\\'s a reason, I just don\\'t know what it is.-We already test drove the Camry and the Sonata. We liked the Accord much more than either. I\\'m not a big fan of domestics so don\\'t see us going toward an Aura or a Fusion. My wife doesn\\'t like coupes or hatchbacks. It\\'s strictly a sedan for her, unless we do a crossover.-The crossover is definitely an idea and a possibility, I just wrestle with the extra cost. We don\\'t have kids yet, and all we really need is a car. But we might consider one of the less expensive crossovers. Anyway, thanks again for the input. We\\'ve just got some research and test driving to do. I think it will be fun.  While you\\'ve driven the Sonata, you might try the Azera. It\\'s not much bigger on the outside than the Sonata but a totally different car for well under $30,000.  Sounds like your wife is looking for something semi-unique but also something that will pamper her. Since you haven\\'t mentioned wanting a car that is fun to drive, I\\'d guess that is why the Mazda or Altima would not fit in the mix for you guys. Not considering domestics narrows it down a lot too, but keep in mind some cars like the aura and fusion are based on other cars whose parent company are from other countries. It also sounds like keeping this purchase below 30k is where you\\'d like to be. Really, sounds like the Azera would be the perfect fit as long as your view of Hyundai isn\\'t too negative, or if you can wait for the new Mazda6 when it comes out first quarter of 2008 to see if that has the image and ride quality that you may be looking for. Good luck in your search...there\\'s no shortage of good cars to choose from!Aaargh bhmr59 beat me to the Azera recommendation lol  If a luxury nameplate is important, why not get a \"previously owned\" Volvo, Acura, Lexus, Infiniti, Mercedes, or BMW with an extended warranty? Lots of folks do that.  Actually, that distinction was part of what was driving my original question--what does a low-end luxury car give you that wouldn\\'t be trumped by a loaded high-end non-luxury car?Well it really depends on what you want. If you\\'re looking at a BMW 3 series for an example, it offers a segment leading driving experience. It\\'s an blast to drive! However, if you prefer to be more pampered there\\'s Lexus and even Audi.You really have to experience these cars in order to see the difference. Sometimes the difference is little, sometimes it\\'s big. Like Backy stated, there are certified pre-owned alternatives you can consider. However do consider that a lot of these luxury cars hold their value well. A Hyundai Azera is a great car. It\\'s very luxurious, and feels almost Lexus-like. But if its a luxury nameplate you want I\\'m not sure it fits into your criteria. But I strongly suggest Hyundai. I bought the 07 Santa Fe not long ago (it\\'s going to replace my Accord eventually as the family car). It has been flawless so far. I think we\\'re getting a little off topic here. I haven\\'t been on this forum in forever. I remember the mods don\\'t like us getting too off topic :P  \"Anyway, thanks again for the input. We\\'ve just got some research and test driving to do. I think it will be fun.\"Do yourself and favor and drive lower end cars from Lexus (250), BMW (328), Cadillac, TL and the like. What you get is standard equipment and options that go beyond these cars. In addition, the drivetrains of the luxury cars are usually superior in one way or another. As far as crossovers drive the X3/FX35/RX350.Good luck buying a car is fun...until you pay for it. :suprise  The drivetrains of mid-sized cars like the Accord, Camry, and Altima are pretty sophisticated. What you get with the cars you listed, beyond more luxury features standard or available, is RWD or even AWD (although AWD is available in some mid-sized family cars such as the Legacy and Fulan).  I think she simply wants to have a more niche vehicle (hence opting out of mainstream names). This reminds me of a friend who almost bought a new Accord but decided to go with a used Mercedes C-class for about the same price.I don\\'t know what your requirements would be, but she could wait for the new TSX (likely out in Spring 2008), look at RDX (although, I\\'m not a fan of crossovers/SUVs for myself), try Volvo S40/S60, or something along those lines.Do you folks need two largish sedans in the family? I have two sedans myself, one (1998 Accord/182K miles) because it was paid off almost eight years ago and an 06 TL. If I were to replace the Accord within next six months, I might seriously consider Fit. It would be just a better long term solution for me (I drive a lot and prefer to keep the cars for a long time). But I have a feeling, if you go for that, you might end up driving it. :P  Hey guys... looking into getting a leftover 07 Accord and was wondering if it would be big enough for me. Any big guys in here have one? I\\'m about 260 pounds, and 6\\'4\".I know people will have different shapes, but a general idea would help. I\\'ve sat in a 2003 once, but can\\'t remember really what it was like.Appreciate it...Ethan  A reporter with a large newspaper is hoping to talk to consumers who are looking to purchase a new midsize vehicle. Please reply to [email\\xa0protected] no later than Thursday, October 18, 2007 with your daytime contact info. along with what car (or cars) you are considering purchasing.  I forgot about the RDX/MDX. Buy an oil well along with the RDX to supply the gas.  RDX is no better or worse than the rest of them out there though. It gets what rest of the powerful/AWD CUVs are.  Hey bud... I\\'m 6\\'4\" (not your size at only 190lbs) but I have plenty of room in the Accord. I\\'m afraid you may find it sort of narrow though, I\\'m not real sure. I have a friend who is 6\\'3\" and 250 or so who fills up the passenger side when he rides with me. You sound like an even bigger guy. I\\'d suggest try it and see!  \"RDX is no better or worse than the rest of them out there though.\"Actually it\\'s worse.  How so? Observed gas mileage (in mag tests) for most of these CUVs tends to be in 15-19 mpg. For example, the new Saturn Vue got 15 mpg, Toyota RAV4/V6 got 16 mpg, RDX usually gets 16-18 mpg. I have had RDX twice as a free loaner from Acura, and both times I averaged 19-20 mpg which is lower than my experience with my sedans but that is to be expected.Not to hijack this thread with a crossover but this does relate to the topic in a way that midsize sedans do make more sense than CUVs when it comes to fuel economy.  - Actually, that distinction was part of what was driving my original question--what does a low-end luxury car give you that wouldn\\'t be trumped by a loaded high-end non-luxury car? Why buy a low-end Acura TSX when they could get a somewhat loaded Accord for the same money? I\\'m sure there\\'s a reason, I just don\\'t know what it is. I\\'ve actually spent some serious time trying to decipher the differences between say a Honda, and an Acura TSX for example. Here\\'s what you pay extra for in the Acura vs. the Accord:Acura has the luxury nameplate and brand image.Acura has the longer warranties (which are useless and never needed by Honda anyway).Acura has nicer interior materials and luxuriously nice interiors. Honda\\'s are nice, Acura\\'s are luxury.Honda gives you more HP and MPG per dollar than Acura; advantage V6 Accord. Honda gives you more torque in the V6 vs. the TSX 4 cylinder. Honda is slightly roomier (07 and older versions). As you can see, the main difference is interior quality and exterior style. The TSX was definitely a step up finish wise, and they are built and assembled in Japan (a definite plus in my mind, but not to many others).Also, I didn\\'t drive the TSX, but from what I hear and read, it has a sportier ride than your typical Accord.  Real world mileage of the RDX can be the worse of the bunch in the right conditions.  \"Honda gives you more HP and MPG per dollar than Acura; advantage V6 Accord. Honda gives you more torque in the V6 vs. the TSX 4 cylinder. Honda is slightly roomier (07 and older versions).\"Okay, what about the TL-S or the RL? Whether the TL-S is worth the difference over a Honda is an individual decision. No doubt pay more, get more.  What does a low-end luxury car give you that wouldn\\'t be trumped by a loaded high-end non-luxury car? Why buy a low-end Acura TSX when they could get a somewhat loaded Accord for the same money? I\\'m sure there\\'s a reason, I just don\\'t know what it is.In case of Acura versus Honda, you could get the more powerful Accord V6 for about the same as Acura TSX. However, there are a few differences. I considered the same a little over a year ago. TSX was #1 on my list, followed by TL and finally Accord. But with Accord, I would have gone EX-L. So, TL was the only car considered with V6. The combination of dealers not budging at all on TSX, and excellent deal on TL prompted me to get that car. I liked quite a few things about the TL over TSX, but TSX chassis tuning was more to my preferences. That said, the Honda to Acura difference can be seen in smaller details (outside of Acura TLC and additional features). There is greater attention to detail in trimmings and the material used (although, TSX wasn&#146;t quite a runaway, compared to Accord). And many of these are hard to put against a dollar amount. If you see it, they are worth it, otherwise one would be fine with the Accord. And of course, one can also see TSX/TL as lifestyle choices, with fewer produced and seen on the road serving a niche as opposed to more sensible choices like the Accord.At this point, and since both TSX and TL are due for redesign (I&#146;m expecting both to be out in about six months), you might be able to find fantastic deals on them, if your wife is fine with older designs.  That can be said of any vehicle. Which CUV comparable to RDX do you think is more fuel efficient? In real world, expect 19-20 mpg out of RDX in mixed driving. Based on trip computers off loaner RDXs, I see other people get just that, as do I. You\\'re going to be hard pressed to find one that does better, unless it happens to be 2WD, or something like a CR-V. One of your recommendations was FX35. It actually does worse.  Which CUV comparable to RDX do you think is more fuel efficient? In real world, expect 19-20 mpg out of RDX in mixed drivingThe CX-7 compares, and for 2008, will run on regular. While it may not save you on MPG\\'s, it saves in overall dollars in you pocket.  If RDX gets 18 mpg, and CX-7 gets 17 mpg (potentially worse with regular, along with degraded performance), you aren\\'t really saving bucks. I can\\'t recall a single comparison test where CX-7 has even matched RDX in observed fuel economy much less beat it.Besides, the point of RDX here is a look into entry level luxury brands. CX-7 is a Mazda. If that weren\\'t the case, CR-V would make a lot more sense, as it seems to be as economical as mainstream midsize sedans.  than Honda\\'s EX-L leather..... noticeably richer.Sort of like the way the Mazda leather seems like vinyl compared to the robustness of Audi\\'s leather to me.  The Birmingham News - Hyundai Article  You mentioned the Toyota RAV and Saturn VUE in your previous post, and comparing their respective fuel economy to the RDX. So, I suggested the CX-7. Surely, you cannot think the RAV or VUE are luxury vehicles. Observed fuel economy in the RDX has consistently been around 16mpg\\'s right there with the CX-7, in numerous tests.After the ECU reflash in the CX-7\\'s, fuel economy improved, and the 2008\\'s have a new map, and adjusted the timing to achieve the same fuel economy using regular. Plus, the added savings over the purchase price make the CX-7 more economical. Now if you are looking for the \"A\" on your grill, then I guess it\\'s the wrong choice for you. So I would look toward a 3-Series BMW w/ X-Drive before I looked at an RDX. Better fuel economy, more luxurious, better driving dynamics.  Sort of like the way the Mazda leather seems like vinyl compared to the robustness of Audi\\'s leather to me. See, to me Audi looks like pleather, especialy in black. Actually, doesn\\'t Audi use fake leather?? It also does not wear well. VW has the same problem. Take a look at the new Mazda6 leather, it\\'s much nicer, they changed it in 2006.  Although obviously not a midsize, when the discussion turns to quality of leather, attention to detail and build-quality, and the new price of an 2008 Accord EX-L V6, or another new car such as a Camry XLE V6, I would rather have a two to three year old Lexus LS430. A certified LS430 with low mileage can be had for about the same price, perhaps a few thousand more.One of my business colleagues just purchased a 2005 LS430 with 36,000 miles, and it\\'s feels and looks new - price paid: $32,700. As Accords, and others, march up the price ladder, an excellent or certified vehicle like the Lexus LS becomes an affordable alternative without much compromise on anything - other than corresponding fuel economy of course.  I can see why you suggested CX-7, but my point was to bring home a point on poor press coverage with fuel economy on RDX, while the same aspect is getting overlooked in mainstreamers (where it actually should matter more).And some people do care for badges, hence the recommendation. One reason the poster\\'s wife didn\\'t want another Accord was not because she was unhappy with the car, but because she seems to want something \"un-mainstream\".  Accords and Camrys have held their price (proportionately) over used Acuras and Lexuses for a long time. So, they aren\\'t the only ones marching up the price ladder. They are also doing so due to added features, refinements and added features. And then there is the point of ownership costs, especially if you hold on to the car for a long time.That is why there is a market for new cars, and certified old (if certified old were fine, why not get loaded Accord/Camry for $15-16K?).  I don\\'t know of Audi ever using any kind of fake leather. You either get leather or cloth as far as I know. Now they have started only using the nice leather on the \"seating surfaces\" whereas they use a high quality \"pleather\" on the high-wear areas, like the sides of the seats and the bolsters I believe. I believe almost all Audi\\'s use some kind of Nappa genuine leather though. Not sure about the black, but if you touch it, it does feel a bit softer and has more traction and grip than the vinyl sections.If Mazda has improved their leather quality in 2006, that is indeed a good thing. Did that carry over to the Mazda3 as well?  cnnmoney.com - CR reliabilty rankingsIt had to happen sooner or later...  \"That is why there is a market for new cars, and certified old (if certified old were fine, why not get loaded Accord/Camry for $15-16K?).\"Perhaps, but the LS430 is substantially more car, both literally as well as figuratively, than either the Accord or Camry. Whether a certified version is worth twice that cost is certainly arguable however.  Oh my gosh... CR not recommending a Camry based on reliability, or lack thereof. Isn\\'t that one of the signs of the Apocalypse? :sick:  Wow! And to relate that article to this topic, it says:Consumer Reports said it no longer recommends V6 versions of Toyota\\'s Camry...andOf the 39 cars rated \"Most Reliable\" in Consumer Reports new list, four are by domestic manufacturers. They are the Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan,...  I was surprised with Lexus GS making that list, not so much with Tundra. With Camry V6, I\\'m left wondering if the trouble spot happens to be the engine (since they specifically mention V6 models) as this could tie back to Toyota suspending sales of Aurion (Camry based \"sport sedan\") in Australia due to engine failure issue.  If people thought along those lines, there would be no need for mainstream midsize or even economy cars. I could buy a 3-year old certified TL or even RL for the same price as a Civic.A lot of car to some may not be a lot of car to another. When I think LS430, I think a big boat with higher upkeep costs.A brand new fully loaded Accord V6 can be driven home for about $28.5K. If an old LS430 (assuming, complete with all the features, including NAV) costs $32K, there is a $4K premium for an older (but more prestigious) car. And considering only fuel costs over next four years/60K miles and assuming gas prices to stay unchanged, Accord V6 would be another $3K cheaper. So, in the name of driving a luxury car, and the true price difference might hover around $7K already.Next, consider the fact that Accord V6 will still qualify for sale as a CPO with only 4 years/60K miles which helps raise the resale value. The Lexus would be out of warranty as a used car, and that will make it less appealing. So, you would lose more money trading/selling it.These are just a few of the things that are easy to overlook, as most of us tend to focus purely on initial costs (worse, MSRP).  Actually Hitler and Saddam just called. Hell just froze over.  will have to dream up a new argument to explain why the supposedly Toyota biased CR has now slammed Toyota\\'s main breadwinner.Shame on Toyota for cheapifying the Camry.  supposedly Toyota biased CRSupposedly? Until now, they were. The proof is in the article.\"In the past, because Toyota products have so consistently proved reliable, the magazine would assume at least average reliability for Toyota\\'s brand new cars, without waiting for survey data from owners.\"Sounds like bias to me.\"But from now on, the magazine will wait for a full year of reliability survey data to come in before it recommends a Toyota product - as it does with most other manufacturers.\"If they\\'re an \"independent\" agency like they say they are, then shouldn\\'t they be doing this for ALL manufacturers in the first place?This article only proves to me what I\\'ve suspected all along.  The article speaks a little differently to me, but I\\'m just another opinion, not the final word. It sounds to me that because of a model\\'s reputation for being reliable in the past, it gets the assumption that it will continue to be. I would think that would carry on with any model. How about the Fusion, would it not get the same assumption?Just my take on it.  Sounds like bias to me. Well, if having Bias is the same as betting on Mike Tyson the first 35 or so fights of his career, then I guess you could put Mike Tyson and Toyota on the same pedestal.You could of bet the farm on Mike Tyson winning every fight every time. And you\\'d of been right and won every bet until you lose your 34th farm on that 35th bet. :P I think CR bet on Toyota the same way. It\\'s not a bad bet.... until of course... it all falls apart. Of course, even Tyson showed signs of life after his first loss.  How about the Fusion, would it not get the same assumption? No, because the Fusion was basically an all-new model when introduced, from a company that hasn\\'t consistently ranked well in the past.The Camry, OTOH, is a new design as well, but CR gave it preferential treatment due to the previous-gen Camry that HAS scored well in the past, and that\\'s where I get the bias from.I\\'d think that if I were running CR, when a new model gets evaluated that\\'s been significantly re-designed or re-engineered, they should NOT \"recommend\" it based on the past, but to actually wait a year until the results come rolling in. They do this for other automakers, so they should do this for ALL automakers, including Honda/Acura and Toyota/Lexus/Scion.  I disagree, if The Fusion maintains great rankings throughout its 1st generation life cycle, and Ford doesn\\'t completely fall apart with every other model, I\\'d whole heartedly expect CR to recommend the 2nd generation Fusion in its first year with only one slight reservation:1) Toyota has a history of redesigning models generation after generation and never having a problem, whereas Ford really hasn\\'t EVER proven they can do the same.  Amen. Good observation about special treatment in the past. But it\\'s still not a scientific survey. It may be a convenience survey and they admit in the article they include visitors to their website; imagine the potential there for slanting against or in favor of a particular vehicle.But JD POwers:Lexus Ties Buick for Reliability!!!!JD Powers uses true survey techniques up through year three.  I saw nothing about admittance of any old visitor to the website slanting their reviews. I saw some implications towards allowing \"subscribers\" to go online and send in their reviews.  OK, I would guess that if the Fusion scored well for 20 years, it would get the benefit of the doubt too.  If Mazda has improved their leather quality in 2006, that is indeed a good thing. Did that carry over to the Mazda3 as well? No, they still use the same leather they used since it\\'s inception. But, it\\'s a cheap($$) car. No need to go all out using extra fine leather in an economy car, especialy when most of it\\'s competition does not even offer leather.  OK, I would guess that if the Fusion scored well for 20 years, it would get the benefit of the doubt too.But to me, there should NOT be any \"benefit of the doubt\", whether they\\'ve scored well for 2 years or 20 years past.It shouldn\\'t matter whether it\\'s from Ford, Toyota, Chevy, etc. A new model SHOULD be fairly evaluated for a year BEFORE getting \"recommended\" or \"avoided\".  Be that as it may, the allegation was one that they do this for Toyota and not for others. What they fail to realize is that the \"others\" haven\\'t ranked consistently well for decades. Right or wrong (I agree with you that its wrong), it isn\\'t just a bias to Toyota.  No, because the Fusion was basically an all-new model when introduced, from a company that hasn\\'t consistently ranked well in the past. The Camry, OTOH, is a new design as well, but CR gave it preferential treatment due to the previous-gen Camry that HAS scored well in the past, and that\\'s where I get the bias from. It is not Toyota\\'s fault that Ford can\\'t keep its model names rolling and feel the need to change them ever so frequently. CR sticks with a formula that is consistent across the board. They are not giving any advantage to Camry by using its past reputation, because it has one. Any other car would get the same treatment. Do you not think Fusion would get that preferential treatment when the next generation rolls around?  Right or wrong (I agree with you that its wrong), it isn\\'t just a bias to Toyota.I agree that it isn\\'t just Toyota that\\'s getting the bias (and I apologize if anyone thinks I inferred that it was only Toyota), I just don\\'t give credit to CR for supposedly NOT giving bias.  It is not Toyota\\'s fault that Ford can\\'t keep its model names rolling and feel the need to change them ever so frequently.And it\\'s not Ford\\'s fault that CR \"recommends\" a redesigned model based on name alone, and NOT any hard data.They are not giving any advantage to Camry by using its past reputation, because it has one.I disagree. It sure seems that the Camry is getting an advantage based on the past. A \"neutral\" company such as CR shouldn\\'t give ANY advantage, at all.Do you not think Fusion would get that preferential treatment when the next generation rolls around?It shouldn\\'t.Once again, it shouldn\\'t be about the name on the car, it SHOULD be about the products themselves, and that they ALL should be evaluated fairly before getting \"recommended\". In other words, no \"recommended\" titles on ANY re-designed or re-engineered models, new name or not, until the data has piled in.  ....will no longer automatically recommend redesigned Toyotas, citing below-average quality in new models.\"Consumer Reports magazine reported today that the quality of cars made by Toyota, long the benchmark for reliability among automotive brands, had slipped so much that the organization no longer will automatically recommend them. The 2007 Camry V6 and Tundra pickup scored below average. Consumer Reports won\\'t recommend any model scoring below average to it\\'s readers. \" By MSN Money\"Ford Scores Big\"For Ford, the news was positive. The magazine said 93% of Ford Lincoln, and Mercury models scored average or better, allowing a \"Recommended\" designation. This includes the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan.I know this was discussed, but, I thought I would just say it myself!  There\\'s a reason to building a heritage, a name. CR goes by a standard (formula), instead of nothing at all. This is not a question of being neutral or unfair.Let us get a perspective on this. You seem to be a Mazda fan. Now, you know what the current Mazda6 is like, in terms of driving experience and potentially, ownership. Would you call yourself utterly clueless about the next Mazda6 because you haven\\'t really driven/owned one yet?  Would you call yourself utterly clueless about the next Mazda6 because you haven\\'t really driven/owned one yet?In essence, yes. I \"expect\" the next 6 to be just as fun to drive as the current model, this would make me biased toward the 6. However, for all I know, it could handle like a yacht and I\\'d hate every second of it. That\\'s why I\\'ll test-drive it as well as the competition to see what I\\'d prefer, previous experience be damned.I wouldn\\'t make ANY decision about any NEW car until I have a chance to test it out for myself, just as CR shouldn\\'t make the decision to \"recommend\" a vehicle until the evidence has piled in.  In essence, yes. I \"expect\" the next 6 to be just as fun to drive as the current model, this would make me biased toward the 6.Are you saying that because you\\'re biased, or because you know how the car is oriented and expect it to carry on the tradition? Because, I\\'m far from being biased when it comes to Mazda6, but I can predict its personality. So, to me, bias doesn\\'t play a role.If Fusion does well in the first generation, would it be unfair/ridiculous for CR to assume that the same can be predicted for the next generation? Perhaps, you could avoid getting into \"predicted reliability\" thing, and just wait for observed results to come out.  I\\'m a huge supporter of Consumer Reports, but always wondered why they seem to recommend new models by Honda and Toyota WITHOUT a year under their belt. Now we know. Frankly, I agree with everyone who says they NEVER should recommend a model in its first year or first year after its redesign, no matter who makes it.  As I understand, predicted reliability is based on history. And I don\\'t think they twist history for Honda and Toyota. For example, Honda Ridgeline (a brand new model) may have been recommended if Pilot already was. In fact, Ridgeline is Pilot with a bed (and a few chassis tweaks). I think the problem is more of perception that CR and like blindly favor Honda and Toyota. The issue really is that these two rarely launch a brand new vehicle. And when they do, like everybody else, the recommendation is based on the automaker\\'s history. If they don\\'t bode well with the prediction over time, the recommendation is no longer valid, as is the case with Camry V6.Name a vehicle that isn\\'t a Honda/Toyota, but is recommended by CR. Then let me know if you think CR would not recommend its replacement when that happens. If you have an example, even better. That would help make your case.  Look what happened to the Mazda CX-7. A CEL problem that lingered a bit too long, and CR hit \\'em hard. Ouch.I have seen a lot of people in this thread, and the Accord thread talking about staying away from the new Accord V6 until the jury comes back with a verdict.  But to me, there should NOT be any \"benefit of the doubt\", whether they\\'ve scored well for 2 years or 20 years past.So 20 years of reliability means nothing more than 0 years of reliability? I think as long as CR puts the word \"PREDICTED\" in front of reliability, the company who has consistantly produced reliable cars can get that assumption. Again, as long as they use the word \"PREDICTED\".I think Toyota has fallen into the same trap that other car makers have (GM to name one). They are trying to build a different car for each customer. They are putting too much emphasis on expanding the model line, and not on the quality of each model. Honda, on the other hand seems to take time to develop each new model, and is less concerned with world domination. Will Toyota right the ship quickly, or will they have to learn the hard way, like GM is now?  This information does not make a difference for me. Not that I personally would get a Toyota tomorrow, but CRs new recommendation means nothing, and I suspect it will be that way to a lot of people. Only a few people out of the hundreds of thousands that are sold would this matter to, imo.A person unhappy with a car that got a gold star is just as unhappy as a person with a car that didn\\'t get the star. Toyota has a good reputation and is likely to keep that reputation.  Many people buy Toyotas--specifically the Camry, here--because of their reputation for reliability. If you take away the Camry\\'s repuation for reliability, what big advantage does it have over the competition? What justifies its price premium over alternatives like Fusion, Milan, Aura, Optima, and Sonata? When that reputation is challenged by a widely-reported and read source, whether it\\'s CR or some other source, it can\\'t help Camry sales. What will be interesting to see in the next few months is if there\\'s any drop in Camry sales, which have been strong up until now.  This information does not make a difference for me. Not that I personally would get a Toyota tomorrow, but CRs new recommendation means nothing, and I suspect it will be that way to a lot of people. Only a few people out of the hundreds of thousands that are sold would this matter to, imo. I don\\'t think this one thing (CR;s non-recommended) will doom Toyota. They still have the know-how to build some great cars. This will only be a blip on the screen, unless the trend of un-reliability continues.  I think Toyota has fallen into the same trap that other car makers have (GM to name one). They are trying to build a different car for each customer. I totally disagree. I think Honda and Toyota make the least common denominator vehicles, ones that are acceptable for 70-80% of the market and not worrying about those that want something other than vanilla.Toyota only has the Corolla, Camry, Avalon and Prius for cars, 2 trucks, one SUV, and 2 crossovers...eh your right, that is lot of cars...and yet still completely unexciting...  \"Many people buy Toyotas--specifically the Camry, here--because of their reputation for reliability\"The people who have not had a problem, imo, won\\'t care. They will get another Camry or Accord.  It reminds me of the \"dark\" Bangle days of BMW. Look at them now. Naysayers doomed them into oblivion and now their style is much copied and they have taken the performance lead back from the competitors. But I digress.  FJ cruiser, Rav4, Sequoia, 4Runner, Land Cruiser, and Hylander. That\\'s six, for Honda\\'s 3, Element, Pilot, and CRV.  Probably so. Unless... they keep seeing reports about the uptick in recalls of Toyotas... and the decline of Toyota\\'s legendary fit and finish (cf. Camry)... and the decline in reliability of the Camry... and they think to themselves, \"Hmmm, that new Malibu (or fill in the blank) looks pretty sweet, and the price is nice, maybe I should go check it out.\"  Remember, at this point the only challenge to the reputation is with the V6. Even though Camry floods the streets, I can\\'t recall seeing a V6 in recent memory. Most that sell are four bangers.That said, reliability is not the only reason these cars sell.  There\\'s so many contradictions. Many say Camry and Accord sell because of their \"reliability.\" If \"realibility\" is failing Camry, why would one spend thousands of dollars more than they would for similar vehicles, some of which offer more standard equipment and better warranties?  You mean the Camry four-bangers that can\\'t win a comparo even against the likes of a five-year-old Accord, a stripped Altima, and... an Optima? The four-bangers that have worse interior quality than a Kia? The four-bangers that have less power than almost anything else in the class? The four-bangers that don\\'t offer safety features like ESC standard, such as competitors like Accord and Sonata? Those four-bangers? Sounds like something I\\'d pay thousands of dollars more for than the competition. NOT.Without the V6, or the HSD powertrain, the Camry is Just Another Family Car. And an expensive one at that.  I\\'m a Honda fan, but would have considered a Toyota in the past. What I\\'m noticing now is that Toyota cars seem to be getting noticibly cheaper looking, and Toyota seems to be doing a less than stellar job of restyling their bread and butter. The new Camrys paint and exteriors look cheaper than previous years, and apparently the design isn\\'t up to snuff. The Corolla hasn\\'t been redesigned in years (yes, I know there is a new one coming) and hasn\\'t even had basic technology added to it to keep it competitive with other cars in the segment. I\\'m not knocking Toyota, but they need to realize that becoming the number one car maker is harder than losing that distinction.  For example, Honda Ridgeline (a brand new model) may have been recommended if Pilot already was. In fact, Ridgeline is Pilot with a bed (and a few chassis tweaks).What?! Look at the interior. Look at the bed. Look at the towing ratings. They may share some components, but they are not the same vehicle. Why did the Ridgeline have some windshield problems where faulty seals were causing whisteling sounds and the Pilot was not? Or for that matter, since the Fusion is based on the Mazda6, using your logic, they should both have the same ratings... well they don\\'t.  In essence, yes. I \"expect\" the next 6 to be just as fun to drive as the current model, this would make me biased toward the 6.Are you saying that because you\\'re biased, or because you know how the car is oriented and expect it to carry on the tradition? Because, I\\'m far from being biased when it comes to Mazda6, but I can predict its personality. So, to me, bias doesn\\'t play a role.Nice selective quote robersmx... Here is what was written in full: \"In essence, yes. I \"expect\" the next 6 to be just as fun to drive as the current model, this would make me biased toward the 6. However, for all I know, it could handle like a yacht and I\\'d hate every second of it. That\\'s why I\\'ll test-drive it as well as the competition to see what I\\'d prefer, previous experience be damned.I wouldn\\'t make ANY decision about any NEW car until I have a chance to test it out for myself, just as CR shouldn\\'t make the decision to \"recommend\" a vehicle until the evidence has piled in.\"That is nothing like how you portray it in your post. If you\\'re going to quote someone at least try to keep it similar to what they write in the complete post.Or else I\\'ll start quoting you as saying...(see only words in bold)Are you saying that because you\\'re biased, or because you know how the car is oriented and expect it to carry on the tradition? Because, I\\'m far from being biased when it comes to Mazda6, but I can predict its personality. So, to me, bias doesn\\'t play a role.If Fusion does well in the first generation, would it be unfair/ridiculous for CR to assume that the same can be predicted for the next generation? Perhaps, you could avoid getting into \"predicted reliability\" thing, and just wait for observed results to come out.  I had a quick business trip with the 07 Accord EX this week. It was the first time I drove it for more than 50 miles in a sitting. I logged ~550 miles in 18 hrs. 1. 332 miles required 9.87 gallons a dead dinosaurs for 33.6 mpg. Given the types of roads I was on (rural highway w/curves and hills and occasional super-slab), and the extra-legal speeds I was traveling, I was very satisfied.2. The car has plenty of power w/manual trans. Passing on that rural 2 lane highway was pretty easy with just a drop into 3rd. I wish it gave a little more feedback.3. The tires are a weak link. The body rolling around doesn\\'t help. That said, the car handles reasonably well, it just feels really unsteady while its doing it. It might be the lack of feedback.4. Not so much on the 4 hr drive there, but on the 4 hr drive back I got very figity and couldn\\'t get comfortable in the seat. I played with the position and the lumbar and just kept figiting.5. If I ever need more trunk space than that car for a one person trip, just shoot me. 6. Features all worked well, FM radio reception was good even in the boonies (although its ridiculous that there is no aux in or MP3 capability, I glad that got correct in the \\'08), the cruise control worked great, and tilting the sunroof and dropping the rear windows 2\" got this great eddy effect in the back seat.7. Wind/road/tire noise was an issue depending on conditions. 8. Headlight pattern was good, with good high beams. It doesn\\'t have as sharp a cut off as the Legacy, which sometimes gives me a headache in certain conditions. I am sure I was overdriving the headlights even with the high beams on, but the light provided was about as good as one could ask for.All in all, it was a reasonably comfortable place to spend 8hrs. I think having suspension that felt a little more planted, a seat that was a little more supportive, and an iPod connection would make things about as good as one could want.  What I\\'m noticing now is that Toyota cars seem to be getting noticibly cheaper looking, and Toyota seems to be doing a less than stellar job of restyling their bread and butter.I agree with you. Maybe that is why I don\\'t have a Camry in my garage. However, there are a lot of buyers who for their own reasons look deeper than the sheet metal and decide the car is the one for them.  So 20 years of reliability means nothing more than 0 years of reliability? I think as long as CR puts the word \"PREDICTED\" in front of reliability, the company who has consistantly produced reliable cars can get that assumption. Again, as long as they use the word \"PREDICTED\".The problem is, the lemmings out there don\\'t catch the word \"predicted\". All they catch is \"Consumer Reports\" and \"recommended\". And of course, the ad agencies will emphasize this \"fact\" to no avail, while the fine print gets ignored.Sorry, but I\\'ll take the words of JD Power and TrueDelta over CR terms of vehicle reliability.  The people who have not had a problem, imo, won\\'t care. They will get another Camry or Accord.Maybe. But reports like this may convince others to look around besides the Camry and Accord, and they may find something else they like, with the lower price and better warranty being the icing on the cake.  \"But reports like this may convince others to look around besides the Camry and Accord, and they may find something else they like, with the lower price and better warranty being the icing on the cake.\"I don\\'t think so, and most people don\\'t give a hoot about JD Powers either. (As an aside ask if people alter their buying decisions based on CR or JD Powers, I have found the answer to be no in general) But this is a point we can argue until to the cows come home. I can see why people buy the Camry. For $21K asnd probably less, I can get a basic no frills, no headache Camry, why wouldn\\'t I want it? While *you* may not want it, I would pick this over the competition including the Accord. At the higher end though, I would pick the Accord.In my mind, what they offer at this price point is the reason there are so many on the road.  As an aside ask if people alter their buying decisions based on CR or JD Powers, I have found the answer to be no in generalInstead of phrasing it the way you do, try asking if their buying decision was influenced by (their perception of) the vehicle\\'s reliability. For example ask...do you think your Camry will be reliable? (assuming answer is yes) Did this have any influence on your decision to buy it?  \"For example ask...do you think your Camry will be reliable? (assuming answer is yes) Did this have any influence on your decision to buy it?\"This has been my point for years. It\\'s not about the statistics, it\\'s about \"my\" vehicle. Do I think \"my\" vehicle will be reliable? My answer always is: \"I hope so.\"There actually isn\\'t any modern vehicle I\\'m overly concerned about. Years ago it was a different story.  I agree. I rarely see a V6 Camry on the streets. Also, those that have been buying Camry\\'s for years are not going to stop because CR said their quality has slipped, especially if they have yet to have an issue with them.The only real affect in sales would be felt by potential new Camry buyers looking at the V6.  What about the people that were affected by the recent problems? They might be more inclined to stick with Toyota if their vehicle was still recommended by CR.  For $21K asnd probably less, I can get a basic no frills, no headache Camry, why wouldn\\'t I want it? Well, here\\'s a few reasons why I would pass. As you said, it\\'s basic and no frills, compared to a loaded competitor. At this price, the Camry will be a basic LE with plastic wheel covers, I4 engine, perhaps no VSC or traction control, basic stereo system, cloth interior, probably a manual driver\\'s seat. OTOH, at the same price one could get a competitor with V6, or an I4 with 17\" alloys, ESC with traction, uplevel sound system, leather interior, power driver\\'s seat, and other niceties such as a longer warranty. Plus a better handling car, and (subjective) a better looking car with a higher-quality interior.As for no headaches... other competitors are reliable also--Accord, Fusion, Milan, Mazda6i, Sonata etc. \"No headaches\" is not worth much when it\\'s not a differentiator.  \"Well, here\\'s a few reasons why I would pass. As you said, it\\'s basic and no frills, compared to a loaded competitor\"I understand you are pickier than the average Joe and you might pass. But to many customers this car fits the bill. Producing mass market appliances is one of Toyotas strengths.  Yes, I agree Toyota is a master appliance maker. But tell me... if the average buyer could buy a basic but reliable white refrigerator, or a reliable stainless steel fridge with icemaker, in-door water and ice, spillproof glass shelves, meat and veggie containers with separate climate controls, and a few other doo-dads including a longer warranty, for the same price--which would they tend to buy? I bought (literally) the stainless steel model.   I bought (literally) the stainless steel model. You bought a DeLorean?   No, the refrigerator. I said \"literally\"--I meant it.  Both of my Accords do something similar when coasting down a hill. If I\\'m coasting at 50MPH in my 1996, the RPMs stay at 2,000RPM or so, but if I barely touch the gas a moment, the revs drop to about 1,500 or so and stay there even after I let off the gas, making it feel like it\\'s freewheeling. I have a video of that I intend to put on youtube to show you if you want to know what I mean. Any ideas what causes this?You can see what I mean by the video link below. It happens after about 00:25.http://youtube.com/watch?v=uUJwOYR_lqY  There actually isn\\'t any modern vehicle I\\'m overly concerned about. Years ago it was a different story.We had some significant concerns, in this regard, about the jaguar X-type, when my wife was considering one in 2005. Aside from that, similarly to you, we hoped and expected that whatever we bought then would be reasonably \"reliable\" and so far the VW Jetta she ended up choosing has been. Now, our standard is not perfection, there have been a couple things that needed fixing under warranty.  Your bump on the throttle at that speed may be enough to kick in the torque converter lock-up.  The thing is, on the interstate at 60, with it locked up, it runs 2350RPMs. 1500 is a LOT lower at 50MPH. At 50, it is already locked up at about 1950RPM I think.  If I was buying a car I would go with what my intuition says to me. Which means I might go for less warranty in exchange for a perception of better ownership experience.the difference between a refrigerator and car is about $19,200. enough to give me pause.  OK. I tend to buy based more on logic, research, financials and other boring stuff like that vs. intuition. To each his own.If you are buying a Camry, the difference to a refrigerator is $19,200. If it\\'s something like a Fusion, Mazda6i, Optima, or Sonata, it\\'s more like $14,000-15,000   I\\'m willing to spend the extra money to get a car I\\'m comfortable with in the long haul. Check my carspace pictures.  How can you not consider the mountain of evidence, which is track record for 20 years, as not being evidence that has piled in????I just don\\'t get it.Again... if you we\\'re forced to bet on sports, wouldn\\'t you pick a team with a good track record lately (New England Patriots) than one who has been spotty lately (Chicago Bears)?  Since the vast majority of Camry\\'s sold aren\\'t the V6 model, this reduction in sales (should it occur) will have little effect on the bottom line.  There is a difference between making a judgement that...\"this new camry is likely to be reliable\" and an organization such as CR putting a \"recommended\" label on a car using different criteria for different manufacturers. What need was there for this, anyway? It\\'s not like the readers are unlikely to come to the reasonable conclusion on their own that \"this new camry is likely to be reliable\". It was a dumb move on CRs part when they decided to do this a few years ago and it sure did not take long for them to get burned by it.  if you we\\'re forced to bet on sports, wouldn\\'t you pick a team with a good track record lately (New England Patriots) than one who has been spotty lately (Chicago Bears)? Following that logic you should be picking the Bears every week for they did go to the SB last year. How can you not consider the mountain of evidence, which is track record for 20 years, as not being evidence that has piled in???? Because it is circumstantial evidence at best. Meaning nothing has been proven and CR should face that fact and not recommend a vehicle until they know more about it. Even when Honda was having tranny problems CR never flinched when making recommendations as far as I know.  Well, since the model with all those doo-dads has no proven long term track record, I\\'d anticipate lots of headaches from lots of problems and having to deal with LOTS of warranty issues and trying to get them to honor the warranty.NO THANK YOU! I\\'ll take the problem-free longer lasting model! So in 5 years when your onto your next super stainless steel Fridge, I\\'ll be just breaking mine in for the next 10 years.  The Camry with 4 banger doesn\\'t need a warranty as far as I know. More standard equipment with longer warranties means more warranty usage and headaches to me. Also, and most importantly, in the 90\\'s and early 2000\\'s even, the Camry did sell, for the most part, on being bulletproof basic transportation. Now with the new redesign, they have a state of the art drive train (V6) and one of the fastest midsize cars ever made.The thing can smoke the majority of 3 series BMW\\'s in the dust!  I think they\\'ve been doing it for eons, and they\\'ve rarely been burned. In fact, they are almost always right, Ridgeline, Prius as examples.  Following that logic you should be picking the Bears every week for they did go to the SB last year. Ha... well.. The Bears were great last year, but what did they do the year before? what are they doing this year? Still spotty if you ask me. Inconsistant would be another term I\\'d use.However, with NE, you could pick pretty much any game any year this decade and come out with a winner. Very consistent. Honda and Toyota-like.  \"The thing can smoke the majority of 3 series BMW\\'s in the dust!\" Then turn left.........  Yes, the Camry is a straight line racer car.... drag race car.  Well, since the model with all those doo-dads has no proven long term track record, I\\'d anticipate lots of headaches from lots of problems and having to deal with LOTS of warranty issues and trying to get them to honor the warranty.NO THANK YOU! I\\'ll take the problem-free longer lasting model! So in 5 years when your onto your next super stainless steel Fridge, I\\'ll be just breaking mine in for the next 10 years.IIRC you have an Audi A3, right? So that perceived Toyota reliability didn\\'t even entice you to get one. I think that might adversely affect your argument.  Well, I\\'ll tell you what, CR had a lot to do with influencing me to take the plunge with a German-make, particularly Audi.Audi has shown consistent and significant continual improvment over the last 5 to 7 years in dependability and reliablity according to CR\\'s charts and information. Audi has continually distanced itself from VW as an independent division that has taken CHARGE of Quality Control and the results show a marked gain for their efforts. Audi has widened the gap between them and VW in CR. If it wasn\\'t for that committment to quality demonstrated by both their promises and words, but also their numbers and results, I may have not purchase a virtually problem-free 26,000 miles later A3. The A3 has been \"great\" and I have not had to make unscheduled dealer visits nor tow truck pickups. I haven\\'t experienced any electrical gremlins or hiccups. Also, my parents and my own (and as I was a kid in it) experience with a \\'87 VW JETTA led me to believe that German cars were built much better than American ones. The Jetta while far from perfect, was no lemon, and it reached 100,000 miles before becoming way too expensive to keep running. My friends experience with a used BMW that he kept for quite a while problem-free also solidified my jump from Toytota/Honda. But you should know, my second runner-up choice to the A3 was the RAV 4 V6, and it was a close contest. Had Toyota ramped up availability quicker, and more widely, and not overpriced it a tad, I\\'d probably be driving a RAV 4.Honda didn\\'t make anything with a hatch/wagon sporty design that was bigger than a subcompact, so they didn\\'t meet my needs. Toyota doesn\\'t have anything truly sporty right now. Out of all the vehicles I considered, the RAV 4 was the biggest, roomiest, and probably least agile (except if you get the Sport trim maybe) of the group, while the A3 was certainly the quickest, fastest, best handling of the group (and the smallest), but it\\'s cornering ability is spectacular with the sport option.Also, Audi, by far and away, stuffed some seriously modern technology such as the DSG true manual-amatic tranny, and direct injection turbo motor. Most automatics are just autos you can shift manually, whereas DSG is more of a manual you can shift automatically. The proof is in the pudding with better 0-60 times and better gas mileage than the 6 speed manual offers.  There is a difference between making a judgement that...\"this new camry is likely to be reliable\" and an organization such as CR putting a \"recommended\" label on a car using different criteria for different manufacturers. That is where you are wrong, IMO. CR does not use different criteria for different manufacturers. If any other car had a 15-20 year history of reliability, it would also be recommended because of \"predicted\" reliability. Case in point the Accord.  That may be Honda&#146;s grade logic at work. The transmission selects a lower gear on an incline. In my 1998 Accord (and TL), the only way to tell that it did is to keep an eye on the tachometer. On level streets, the transition seems to happen around 40 mph, Hondas don&#146;t seem to use the top gear until past 35-40 mph (I find that interesting, and was going to discuss it in EPA fuel economy rating related threads).Going uphill, touching throttle will not do anything (unless you demand more power then it will go down another gear or two but never the taller gear). Going downhill, however, I&#146;ve heard, grade logic (and the engine braking that comes from it) gets cancelled if you use the throttle. This will select the taller gear and the rpm will drop (by about 30%, or whatever the difference in ratio is).Something I do find interesting is that the tachometer is reading lower than I would expect it to, at 45-50 mph (in either third or fourth gear), unless 1996 was geared taller than 1998. In my 1998, 50 mph would correspond to about 1900 rpm in fourth.  That\\'s just it buddy, the car IS geared shorter than the 1998-2002. The drop in RPMs to 1500 or so at 50MPH is well below its normal operating RPM in 4th gear (its usually right at 2000 RPM at 50). It is in 4th gear the whole time in that video I posted. Third gear would have it well over 3,000 RPM at those speeds. The torque converter is also already locked up. It isn\\'t grade-logic because it never leaves 4th gear.Let me be really clear. Under normal conditions (flat road, not accelerating) at 50MPH, the car is in 4th, torque converter locked-up, car running 2,000 RPM. Go down a hill with no throttle, the RPMs are still around 2,000 RPM. Tap the throttle lightly (less than 10%) and let back off, and the revs will drop siginificantly and hold until you push the gas again.  Go down a hill with no throttle, the RPMs are still around 2,000 RPM. Tap the throttle lightly (less than 10%) and let back off, and the revs will drop siginificantly and hold until you push the gas againThat is grade logic at work. The car already selected third gear, and when you tap the throttle, it cancels the logic and transmission shifts into fourth.I can\\'t feel fourth to third gear shift in my Accord when grade logic engages. The only way to tell is to keep an eye on the tach while the condition is right for grade logic to show up. Like I said, this will happen on an incline at speeds above 40 mph. On level ground, you might see something like you do on an incline as your car either speeds up past (about) 40 mph or is slowing down to below 40 mph (this seems to be the magic speed in my TL, below which, I cannot select fifth gear, and the car will only use the 1-4 gears). See if you notice this in your car too.While drop (or gain) in rpm can be explained by above which is embedded in transmission logic, the lower rpm can\\'t be. Do you have gear ratios (and tire size) handy? But ~1500 rpm in fourth seems low (which, coincidentally, is something you would see in fifth gear in the new Civic between 45-50 mph since it is geared very tall).  I can\\'t feel fourth to third gear shift in my Accord when grade logic engages. Heh, I CAN! The trannies in the pre-1998 Accords are pretty \"firm\" in their shifting. Not very smooth at all. Trust me, I\\'ve been driving this car for five years, I can recognize the grade logic working in a downshift (not trying to sound patronizing). The car never shifts gears. Its as if something disengages, like when you engage a clutch when in gear.  You are comparing Honda and Toyota to the Patriots. Does that also mean that they are dishonest like Bill Belicheat?  I think it is disengagement of torque converter that you\\'re noticing. If you step on the throttle, it goes back up to the expected rpm, right? (In my Accord, it happens at lower speeds, but then, I haven\\'t paid close attention going downhill at speed).  I think it\\'s just the way Honda transmissions work. The engine will go all the way down to almost idle speed while in gear. Most automatic transmissions will downshift before the rpms get that low. It feels like the transmission goes into neutral, if the rpms are at the certain level.  No, it\\'s not the level of shift bud. The RPMs drop LOWER THAN TYPICAL when coasting downhill after tapping the throttle. I STILL don\\'t think y\\'all are getting it...It\\'s not that the tranny is holding a high gear longer, it\\'s that the engine is running lower RPMs than the gear ratios specify when under those conditions i mentioned previously. 60MPH at 1,500 RPM in my 4-cyl Accord which is 500 lower than it runs when running normally. I took a video tonight of it in my 2006 EX 4-cyl Auto. You can see it runs 1,200 RPM at over 50 MPH. This is not a typical gear ratio (it should be at 1700 RPM).http://youtube.com/watch?v=5dsg7h3-kMY  The engine will go all the way down to almost idle speed while in gear.I meant to add, that my Accord will drop from fifth to fourth gear by 35MPH at the very slowest, sometimes sooner. At that point, in 4th gear, its still only running 1,500RPM  Because you are going downhill, the car can be traveling faster than the engine is pushing it. In this instance the rpm will be lower than the speed would normally indicate on flat ground. Most automatic transmissions will not do this, from my experience. Most automatics will effectively engine brake, even in top gear. The torque converter is probably not locked, when this happens, since the wheels are allowed to travel faster than the engine rpms suggest. Does that sound even close Grad?  It ALMOST goes over my head, and it almost makes sense, but the fact that there is a noticeable drop in RPM (300-500 within a second sometimes) instead of just a big increase in speed. The speed may never change, but the RPMs do. It happens on off-ramps all the time; trying to slow down, I can barely carress the throttle once and send the RPMs down by 500 or so. They hover at 1,000 from 50-35MPH until it finally downshifts to 4th, sending revs back to normal range.I think I\\'ve come off as rude; I\\'m not trying to be, just trying to come up with an answer to this phoenomenon. If I\\'ve been short with anyone, I do apologize. Y\\'all have done nothing but try and help!  Have you guys tried doing this in your cars?  Have you guys tried doing this in your cars?The next time I\\'m on a long bridge, I\\'ll try it. Hills do not exist around here.   Sometimes, a hill isn\\'t necessary. Decelerating from 60+ MPH coasting, then tapping the gas quickly only to coast again, can cause this sometimes as well.  I am glad you found a vehicle that meets your needs. I do find it intriguing though that after being such a fan of Toyota or Honda, you bought a German make. It was very interesting to see the vehicles you were considering. I think the vehicle attributes I hold dear are very different from the ones that you were seeking and I have a better understanding of where you were coming from.In looking for a small/midsize wagon, did you look at the Legacy at all?   Have you guys tried doing this in your cars? I\\'ve been trying, but the proper conditions have not occured for me yet. Did you see the discussion on fuel use (or lack thereof) when coasting in gear vs. in neutral on the \"future of the manual transmission\" discussion? I don\\'t know if that has any connection to what you are seeing, but a minimum rpm figure of about 1500 came up in that unresolved discussion...so I wonder if there is any connection.  Probably not. 1,500 RPM occurs at 50 MPH. At different speeds, the RPM drops differently. Today, on my way to school, I managed to make the (1996) car do this at 65MPH (it dropped to about 2,000RPM, when at that speed it should be right at 2,500-2,600).  I don\\'t know if anyone\\'s posted this link to an AutoWeek overview of the new Accord. If it\\'s already been posted, I apologize.http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071017/FREE/310170003/1532/- FREE  Have you guys tried doing this in your cars? Yes. It seems to disengage torque converter when coasting below certain speed. As I slowed down from 60 to about 35 mph, the engine rpm and wheel speed matched (about 1800 rpm). Beyond that point, it felt more like shifting into neutral. A very light tap and the rpm would again match the speed.  Somebody told me that the Mazdaspeed6 requires 93 octane and that even 91 hurts performance a lot. Well you can\\'t get 93 in CA, only 91!. If this former is true, why would Mazda do this? Is that why the Mazdaspeed 6 is in the showroom forever? Something is wriong because the all wheel drive is a really good thing, and this car should be selling.  the fact that it is choosy about its gas is really a function of the turbocharging that allows the 270HP in the first place. It is very common and almost universally true that turbo/supercharged engines require premium gas, the higher the octane the better. The VW 200hp 2.0 is also an engine that \\'suffers\\' from an appetite for octane. IMO, the illogical difficulty Mazda seems to have selling the Speed6 (it is being discontinued for 08 apparently) has less to do with the fuel issue (as I expect most buyers could handle the 20 cents/gal in exchange for the 60 extra (over the V6) ponies and better overall FE - but more to do with price, it is still relatively pricey, even despite some rather deep discounting. That all said, however, it is a fun car to drive with that stick, and genuinely does offer something different in this class.  That was a most unflattering review of the 2008 Accord. It makes me even happier than my wife and I bought a new 2007 V6 SEL AWD Fusion on Dec. 4 last year. Except for poor in-city gas mileage (14.8 mpg), it has been a most satisfactory car for 10-plus months and 4,900 miles.  IMO, the illogical difficulty Mazda seems to have selling the Speed6 (it is being discontinued for 08 apparently) has less to do with the fuel issue (as I expect most buyers could handle the 20 cents/gal in exchange for the 60 extra (over the V6) ponies and better overall FE - but more to do with price, it is still relatively pricey, even despite some rather deep discountingThe price was not the reason the Mazdaspeed6 had issues selling, it was marketing. First, they built a performance vehicle, with an adult feel, appealing to the mature (non EVO/Sti buyer) buyer that was looking at the BMW 3 series, Audi A4, and Legacy GT. Not only did Mazda build a car that was a great performer, it had better driving dynamics then all too. However, they made this vehicle in only a 6-speed manual. Great for the enthusiast, bad for the rest of the potential customers. How many BMW 3 series and Audi A4\\'s do you see in a stick? Not many. So, since this vehicle was out performed by the EVO and STi, the enthusiast crowd opted for the later, not the MS6.The MS6 was only going into production for 2 year\\'s, with a total production number of 10-12K unts in NA. Mazda planned this, it was not due to lack of sales that they abandoned the vehicle.My brother and best friend both own one, and it is one heck of a vehicle. It\\'s fast, handles great, and has a great feel inside with great build quality.Overall, it was a great vehicle, but was marketed toward the wrong people. The Mazdaspeed3 has been marketed to the young buyer, and has been selling like hot cakes.  OK I\\'ll bite on most of this - except I don\\'t think that it is conceiveable that those young buyers out there are ever going to view a Mazda6 in the same way they do a Evo/Sti/GTI. Those cars (the Evo etc) much more competitive instead to the Speed3, the Speed6 simply too large and the Mazda6 is generally perceived as a Camcord alternate - in any case a different and probably more mature buyer. And sure all mfgrs. will end up justifying their \\'mistakes\\' with a \\'planned\\' 2 year production run - wonder what would have happened if the car had sold well.  And sure all mfgrs. will end up justifying their \\'mistakes\\' with a \\'planned\\' 2 year production run - wonder what would have happened if the car had sold well. I went to the Mazdaspeed6 drive event 2 months before the vehicle went on sale in the U.S., and it was then that Mazda told us of their plans. There has never been any Mazdaspeed vehicle to run longer then 2 years. Never did they ever plan from the start to build more then 12K units. Never. Maybe if it was a huge hit, they might have considered it, but, that\\'s doubtful.  except I don\\'t think that it is concieveable that those young buyers out there are ever going to view a Mazda6 in the same way they do a Evo/Sti/GTI.I never said anyone would. The vehicle was marketed toward the BMW 325Xi, Audi A4 Quattro, and Legacy GT. Mazda never intended to compete with the EVO/STi crowd. Here is an quote from the Mazdaspeed6 Drive Event work book: \"In comparison, the Mazdaspeed6 is targeted at a true performance enthusiasts who see their cars as an exciting form of self expression. These buyers tend to be married men in their late thirties and early forties. They are financially comfortable college graduates in successful professions at work and with young families at home.\" Does that sound like an EVO/STi buyer to you? Nope. At the end of the book is a comparison with the Mazdaspeed6 to the Audi A4 Quattro 2.0T/3.0T, BMW 325xi/330xi, and Subaru Legacy GT  \" it had better driving dynamics then all too.\"I am going to challenge you on the assertion the MS6 has better driving dynamics than the 3 series. The STi is a no nonsense car that devours all comers. Adjustable differential, water cooler intercooler, upgradeable ECU etc. The MS6 has more luxury than the STI but less performance. I\\'d prefer the STI and I\\'m not a boy racer.  and the MS6 is not larger than any A4 or 3 series ever was and is not hampered by the \\'family sedan\\' image? Of course it is, and maybe Mazda\\'s mistake. Sans the MS6, Mazda plays very poorly in the HP wars these days almost making \\'zoom-zoom\\' a joke. Maybe if Ford will let them have enough 3.5s they can get back in the right neighborhood, but if this will be the case, won\\'t Ford recognize that there would be no reason for us to buy a Fusion.  Sans the MS6, Mazda plays very poorly in the HP wars these days almost making \\'zoom-zoom\\' a joke.There is more to zoom zoom than horsepower. Those that drive a 270hp lounge chair might not get the difference.  According to CR\\'s latest survey data, here\\'s the most and least reliable mid-sized cars, i.e. predicted reliability as a new car:Most Reliable-listed in ratings order, starting with the best scoreToyota Prius Honda Accord (2007) Hyundai Sonata (4-cyl.) Toyota Camry Hybrid* Ford Fusion Mercury Milan Least Reliable-listed in ratings order, starting with the worst scoreChevrolet Impala (V8) Volkswagen Passat Pontiac G6Volvo S40/V50 (turbo, FWD) * means the assessment was based on only one model yearhttp://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/2007-10-16-toyota-cr_N.htm  I am going to challenge you on the assertion the MS6 has better driving dynamics than the 3 series After driving both on the same course, the MS6 equaled the BMW in handling, however, it out performed it in acceleration, and braking. This was the 2006 BMW 325xi sedan.  Mazda plays very poorly in the HP wars these days almost making \\'zoom-zoom\\' a joke. Maybe if Ford will let them have enough 3.5s they can get back in the right neighborhood, but if this will be the case, won\\'t Ford recognize that there would be no reason for us to buy a Fusion. What are you talking about?? The Mazda6 is up for a redesign, and in 2003 it was just as competitive as the rest of the mid sized sedans. The Mazda3 is STILL a top performer in the compact market. The MX-5 is revered at the #1 roadster of all time. The CX-7 is quicker/ drives better then a Murano/CR-V and others. The CX-9 has been absoultley great, and just won the MT SUV of the year, kudos to its driving dynamics. The MS3 smashes it;s competitions, beating the Si and GTI. How has Mazda making \"zoom-zoom\" a joke? You gotta be kidding me, it seems as if you know nothing about Mazda. They are more \"zoom-zoom\" now then ever.  Yes, it might outperform the 325xi, but wouldn\\'t have a chance next to the 335xi. It might win the stop light race from the 328(xi) but not win on driving dynamics. The 325xi is about the worse performer from BMW, but I cannot comment on the veracity of the comparison. Someone else might have a different take.  From the AutoWeek review of the Accord:Thumbs way up on the way the car drives, which is what matters, of course. It\\'s a Honda: stable, solid and quiet on the road. It is not, however, much fun to drive, even with a manual transmission. The engine is adequate, but you need to really wring out the shifter to keep it in the power band; it feels like a slug at low revs. And to think there\\'s an even less-powerful four-banger available.Ouch... I figured Honda would soften up the Accord a little, but to make the v-6 get this kind of review, that is very surprising from a magazine which has generally been very nice to Honda. I\\'ve heard the coupe is a bit more fun though, so I still have hope. But it sounds like \"fun to drive\" and stylish is becoming the domain of the more expensive Acura.  The car was an I-4, not a V6  I found the Accord pleasant to drive, very solid and with a smoother ride than the previous generation. A great family car. But fun? No.I wonder if Honda has considered an Accord Si version, ala the Civic Si.  oh yeah, I forgot there are two different I-4\\'s.  I hate to hear they\\'ve gone more mainstream and given up some crispness... that was a part of the Accord\\'s appeal over its competitors!  I think it\\'s because Honda wanted to go for a bigger piece of the pie and aim at Camry buyers. Camry owners like their pillow soft ride so Honda had to compromise. That\\'s too bad.  The Camry ride is not \"pillow soft,\" but is is pretty smooth compared to an Accord. Maybe an Avalon or Buick Lucerne is pillow soft. The Accord ride is pretty rough and bumpy if the road isn\\'t glass smooth.  And sure all mfgrs. will end up justifying their \\'mistakes\\' with a \\'planned\\' 2 year production run - wonder what would have happened if the car had sold well.Has ANY MazdaSpeed model lasted more than 2 years? Let\\'s see... The MS Miata? Nope... The MS Protege? Don\\'t think so (and that was a good seller for Mazda.) The current MS3 (as of right now) is planned on lasting until \\'09, since a new 3 is expected in \\'09-\\'10.Mazda has NEVER planned on a MazdaSpeed lasting more than 2 years, it\\'s simply a way to entice the model before an expected redesign. Always has, always will.What would happen if the car sold well? Nothing more than a bigger profit for Mazda.  Sans the MS6, Mazda plays very poorly in the HP wars these days almost making \\'zoom-zoom\\' a joke.That\\'s funny, since the 3, CX-7 and CX-9 are plenty powerful compared to the competition, and 263 HP in a compact such as the MS3? Hardly a \"joke\"...Maybe if Ford will let them have enough 3.5s they can get back in the right neighborhood, but if this will be the case, won\\'t Ford recognize that there would be no reason for us to buy a Fusion.This won\\'t be an issue, since the next 6 is expected to get the 3.7L Mazda-sourced V6 that the current CX-9 has.  \"Hardly a \"joke\"YOu\\'re right it\\'s not a joke. VW has it\\'s GTI and BMW will be putting 300+ hp in the 1 series. The whole zoom zoom thing to me is a joke. Part of the turnoff of the brand, not to mention better offerings from competitors.  It is not so much about drag racing, it\\'s more about this:Ignoring the 25 mph recommended speed, of course  .  re 6447 and othersGrad, I have found on my 2006 Sonata LX that when I have been going at a normal speed, then slow by taking my foot off the gas, the car seems to have a \"slight drag\" that by tapping the gas releases that drag. This may be the same type thing you are addressing. I don\\'t know/understand it either, but think it is the transmission holding the gear while decelerating,and the \"tap\" releases the gear. It is consistent and obvious when it happens. Obviously it is detectable by looking at the tachometer. I haven\\'t noted the actual amounts however. van  This won\\'t be an issue, since the next 6 is expected to get the (whatever) another lesson in Fordspeak? Wonder if anything or anybody has ever delivered on a promise that also happens to be associated with that company. This kind of thing really gets old.You didn\\'t (apparently) notice - the context in which I was pointing out the absence of the \\'zoom-zoom\\' was as it is related to the Mazda6 and its place specifically in this category. The Speed3 is a solid entrant in the \\'rice rocket\\' category, and the CXs may be reasonable choices in the SUV/Car category but we are talking about the 6 here and lamenting the loss of the one model that delivers some of that \\'zoom\\'. And even if Ford/Mazda can deliver 260-270hp in a 3.7 liter V6 someday, it is still a bored/stroked Ford Duratech (much like Ford\\'s 3.5) regardless of who actually manufactures it - hardly solid ancestory. I still contend Mazda would be far better off and likely offer a more competitive product if Toyo Koyjo (splg?) was not influenced by goings on in Dearborn.  and jeffyscott - while many understand what you\\'re saying, no FWD (OR FWD BIASED awd) will ever do the 25mph curvies in the same way that things like a 3 series ( or 1 series) can and do. 60%+ forward weight distribution along with the driven wheels also doing the steering has that effect. Simply tightening up a suspension, and making a car ride (and feel) like a go cart, does not change the laws of physics and the ultimate terminal understeer that all cars of this genre must suffer from. In summary, if Mazda really wanted to compete on these 25 mph curvies you reference they also need to get out of the FWD car business (as do many other mfgrs.).  another lesson in Fordspeak? Wonder if anything or anybody has ever delivered on a promise that also happens to be associated with that company. This kind of thing really gets old.Frankly, so does your (unnecessary) Ford-bashing.but we are talking about the 6 here and lamenting the loss of the one model that delivers some of that \\'zoom\\'.That\\'s because it was introduced IN 2003, while everyone since then has had a major redesign.And even if Ford/Mazda can deliver 260-270hp in a 3.7 liter V6 someday, it is still a bored/stroked Ford Duratech (much like Ford\\'s 3.5) regardless of who actually manufactures it - hardly solid ancestory....In your opinion. Ask the thousands of Probe and Contour owners (among other vehicles), they\\'ll probably give you a different answer.I still contend Mazda would be far better off and likely offer a more competitive product if Toyo Koyjo (splg?) was not influenced by goings on in Dearborn.Wow. Your ignorance knows no bounds, doesn\\'t it?Ford bought their controlling share when Mazda was doing nothing but hemorrhaging $$$ on these shores. The bleeding was due in large part of Mazda\\'s plan in the mid-\\'90\\'s to abandon their sporty niche, and offer more \"competitive\" products to the Honda/Toyota crowd. Their loyal fan base bolted, and sales plummeted. Since then, and due in part to Fords capital, they\\'ve not only stopped the bleeding, but have introduced new product (such as the 3, 6, CX-7, CX-9, etc.), returning to a niche that Honda and Toyota long since abandoned, has built a loyal fan base, and are one of Ford\\'s \"divisions\" that\\'s actually MAKING PROFITS.Just because they don\\'t sell 500K 6s per year doesn\\'t mean that they\\'re not \"competitive\", especially when they\\'re still making $$$ as a company.  Correct. \"zoom-zoom\" is a philosophy of a total driving experience. The Mazda6 is the LAST vehicle in it\\'s segment to get overhauled. It it\\'s debut, it received numerous awards for it\\'s driving dynamics, and driving spirit of which the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima lacked. Currently, all have gone complete overhauls, and the Mazda6 still remains the same. When the new 6 debuts, I\\'m sure it will go right back to the top of the best overall performing vehicle in it\\'s class. That is \"zoom-zoom\"Capitan-Will Mazda ever be BMW? No They don\\'t need to be, no do they want to be. right now, they have a growing image, and the brand is appealing to record setting customers world wide. If Mazda knew nothing about making true performance vehicles, then why are there \"more Mazda, or Mazda powered vehicles raced on the roads of America then any other brand\"*?*sourced directly from the SCCA.  I think the problem is more of perception than reality. Take Acura TL for example. 2004-2006 Acura TL were firm riding cars, so imagine the ride quality in a performance tuned version when Acura did launch the Type-S.They did in 2007. However, something worth noting is the first thing I read about the 2007 TL and TL-S. The new TL (now base) received chassis tweaks to have a smoother ride. Based on a few reviews, interestingly enough, the new TL Type-S rode more like the 2004-2006 TL with much improved handling performance. In fact, from a R&T comparison test: &#147;What&#146;s impressive about the TL Type-S is that it also has a smooth ride quality. We all agreed that for a cross-country trip, the TL would be our choice&#148;The base TL now rode smoother, but it handles as well as the 2004-2006. In other words, ride quality doesn&#146;t tell the whole story. I&#146;m willing to bet that the new Accord has received similar chassis tweaks that TL did, improving the ride quality while retaining or improving handling qualities. Since I haven&#146;t driven the new Accord, I can&#146;t really claim that the handling is better or not, but virtually all reviews have suggested that it is the flattest and best handling Accord. If it comes with improved ride quality, why not?Besides, my idea of a good handling car isn\\'t in how much g\\'s a car pulls, or steering responses at slow-mid range speeds (no matter how isolated or connected). It is how confidently and nicely a car tracks, and goes in the direction it is pointed at, with confidence, over bumps. And that is actually where Accord\\'s chassis shows up.  no FWD (OR FWD BIASED awd) will ever do the 25mph curvies in the same way that things like a 3 series ( or 1 series) can and do. 60%+ forward weight distribution along with the driven wheels also doing the steering has that effect.Usually yes, but things aren&#146;t as straight forward. Chassis tuning has a lot to do with it. I have a favorite circular ramp on my way to work, where the speed drops from 60 mph to 20 mph. I let my front driver slow down to about 40-45 mph at the entry (if not following another vehicle that is braking, virtually everybody does). I enter tangentially, and then accelerate while turning the steering inwards. The rear suspension shows up, and provides passive steering, allowing the car to rotate under throttle. The car easily handles 50 mph on the ramp on &#147;grand touring&#148; all-season rubber.The feedback from the steering wheel about things happening in the powered wheels takes away the complete reliance on stability control (which my &#147;that&#148; car doesn&#146;t have). The 5-link rear suspension takes over and responds to throttle input. It is more fun because of the stealth factor. Tackling curves like that isn&#146;t expected in a family sedan not tuned at all for race track.  the Probe used the Vulcan V6 I believe and was not the engine of choice in that car (originally intended to be the new Mustang), the Contour OTH did have an OHC V6, (2.5 liter?) and I believe the first \\'Duratech\\'. And yes I owned a 89 Probe 4 banger, and thought it was a reasonable effort by Ford only in that in really was a Mazda. But at the same time a beginning of the demise of Mazda (Mx6) as a viable alternative to the Japan 3. And why on earth, is simply pointing out Ford\\'s histories of broken promises and/or late deliveries \\'bashing\\'? To this day I\\'m not sure anybody knows what Ford is really going to do about replacing that wheezy 3.0DT in the Fusion, or even if they\\'ll be around long enough to do it.PS - other Mazdas I owned over the years include an 808, RX2, GLC and 626, and yes my recent defections (2002) to Nissan and Toyota products has a lot to do with Ford\\'s influence on Mazda. Mazda used to be truly innovative (things like the multiple renditions of the Wankel - the Cosmo, RX7 comes to mind, and of course the Millenia which might just be the most underrated sedan of its day). I believe Mazda could do this again (without Dearborn calling the shots).  Simply tightening up a suspension, and making a car ride (and feel) like a go cart, does not change the laws of physics and the ultimate terminal understeer that all cars of this genre must suffer from. In summary, if Mazda really wanted to compete on these 25 mph curvies you reference they also need to get out of the FWD car business (as do many other mfgrs.).I would love to see a rear wheel drive mazda6, but I know pricing would be an issue. I\\'m sure there are more things about a BMW that is better than the Mazda, but since they are way out of my price range, I don\\'t need to know. Of the choices of cars that offered fun and safe driving dynamics that could haul lots of cargo with a comfortable ride and cost less than 25k, the Mazda6 was the perfect mix for me. In the 2 years I\\'ve owned it, it has been a pleasure to drive. Although not the fastest in a straight line, it is still plenty fast especially in cornering where this car is a real standout in this class. Recently, consumer\\'s digest listed the mazda6 among the most sporty cars for 2007, and the editors of Edmunds chose the Mazda6 the most desireable for 2007. In fact, the Mazda6 is still highly praised for it\\'s combination of zoom-zoom, comfort, and practicality. Here are some of the reviews of the Mazda6:From Edmonds:On an open road, the 6 shines with its communicative steering and poised chassis. It\\'s while unraveling a twisty road that the 6 distances itself from its less involving and less athletic peers. Yet it\\'s no less affable on the highway, where it delivers as smooth and quiet a ride as anything in its class.Like most other Mazdas, the 6 is a thrill behind the wheel. Neither engine is exceptionally powerful, especially off the line, though the V6\\'s smooth, quiet power delivery offsets this\\x85.Communicative steering goes a long way toward making the 6 fun to drive, whether it\\'s on the highway or from corner to corner on back roads. The well-sorted suspension achieves a superb balance between comfortable ride quality and athletic handling.From automotive.com:The Mazda6 is sportier than other mid-size sedans, both in its appearance and in its handling and driving dynamics. It\\'s more agile and holds the road better than the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, or Nissan Altima. It\\'s lighter on its feet and stops quicker, too. In short, it\\'s a better driver\\'s car. It\\'s also the best sedan for the money that Mazda has ever built.When it comes to sporty handling, the Mazda6 is among the best in the class. It offers better road holding than the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and Nissan Altima, and it offers better transient response in quick lane-change maneuvers. The Camry feels genuinely lethargic by comparison and the Altima feels like a bigger car. The Mazda\\'s handling is even sharper than the Honda\\'s.  Besides, my idea of a good handling car isn\\'t in how much g\\'s a car pulls, or steering responses at slow-mid range speeds (no matter how isolated or connected). It is how confidently and nicely a car tracks, and goes in the direction it is pointed at, with confidence, over bumps. And that is actually where Accord\\'s chassis shows up.This is why there are so many different vehicles available. Steering response AND feel are 2 metrics that are very important to me. Straight line tracking should not be affected. Turn in (a function of the tires and front suspension geometry) is very important to me as well. My Accord\\'s turn in is pretty sorry (more a function of the tires) and it never really takes a set in a turn, and it definitely doesn\\'t do anything to inspire confidence. In contrast, the \\'93 Accord had great turn-in response (especially on the Kumhos) and was very communicative about what the tires were doing. Even dips in mid-turn didn\\'t upset the balance that much, as opposed to the oscillation the \\'07 goes into.I think if straight line tracking and bump absorption was what I was after, I would probably look at the GM offerings.  Sans the MS6, Mazda plays very poorly in the HP wars these days almost making \\'zoom-zoom\\' a joke. The HP wars are a joke. I would be extremely pleased if Mazda would offer only 4 cylinders in the new Mazda6. North America is the only market where V6 is required for market acceptance.Shame on us.Of course, if Mazda wanted to win the power wars, they could offer a turbine option for the Mazda6.Turbine BeetleZoom Zoom to me is fun to drive. Fun to drive is great handling without being harsh. Lighter is better. Mazda is making it\\'s new models lighter than previous models. Kudos to Mazda for making the new 6 and 2 lighter than the old ones. Adequate power is mandatory. Mazda6 i fulfills this mission and is fun to drive. I concede it would be no fun at all to drag race.Mazda describes Zoom Zoom as-Mazda&#146;s creativity, passion, and innovation are dedicated to delivering fun and exhilarating driving experiences to customers who remember the &#147;emotion of motion&#148; first felt as a child. It&#146;s the &#147;wind-in-your-hair&#148; feeling you get from horseback riding on a crisp fall day, the sense of freedom from cruising down a wooded country lane in a sleek convertible, or the exhilaration that comes from a roller coaster ride. Zoom-Zoom starts with a visual promise. Mazda vehicles are designed to not only catch the eye; they convey an immediate image of youthful exuberance, style and driving fun. Spirited performance is an essential element of Zoom-Zoom. With that goal always in mind, every Mazda vehicle is designed to offer features that continually surprise and delight our customers. -endThe only competition for Mazda Zoom Zoom in Mazda\\'s price range IMHO is Subaru. And I suspect Subaru may be losing or changing it\\'s path.  yes, there are certainly ways to minimize the negative impacts of FWD and the correspondent weight imbalances, something that a number of mfgrs. have been attempting for years and to varying degrees of success. Just don\\'t confuse one of these \\'attempts\\' with what are truly \\'sports sedans\\' and probably made over in Germany someplace.  Yes, the Mazda6 is designed to compete in the FWD moderately priced family sedan category, while having \"sportier\" ride and handling than others do. I don\\'t think BMW has an entry in this category, so it is not really a competitor.I think the idea is Mazda is trying to be the zoomiest in each category in which it competes, not in an absolute sense.It is not really a sedan or midsize, but if one wants a RWD car, that handles even better than the 6, there is the Mazda RX-8. It would not appeal to me, but perhaps someday they will do a RWD sports sedan. They are a pretty small player in the US though, so can not really expect them to be everything to everyone. For myself, I can go faster than I want to around any corner and curve, without any of this supposed understeer, even in my (according to some) under-powered automatic mazda6...which I believe is zoomier than the other FWD 4cyl automatic familiy sedans  .  Subaru? like Mazda and not in the HP wars? 250hp Legacys and 300hp Wrxs don\\'t count? Heck, it was Subaru (and Mitsu)that invented the \\'factory\\' rice rocket did they not? Yes, the WRX/Evo are all about \\'zoom-zoom\\', because they do have the power to match some handling abilities.  Subaru? like Mazda and not in the HP wars? :confuse: :sick: You STILL don\\'t understand that Zoom Zoom is NOT about HP only, do you?  I\\'m wondering if you would take that turn in that German car at above 50 mph. I would like to see that.   read #6492 - this is why your \\'zoom-zoom\\' is a joke - IMO you need HP as well as athleticism - otherwise it is very very difficult to take seriously, especially when you discontinue the model that largely delivered on that promise.  How much HP?  re 6447 and others Grad, I have found on my 2006 Sonata LX that when I have been going at a normal speed, then slow by taking my foot off the gas, the car seems to have a \"slight drag\" that by tapping the gas releases that drag. This may be the same type thing you are addressing. I don\\'t know/understand it either, but think it is the transmission holding the gear while decelerating,and the \"tap\" releases the gear. It is consistent and obvious when it happens. Obviously it is detectable by looking at the tachometer. I haven\\'t noted the actual amounts however. Lightfoot, what you are describing is exactly right. What little engine braking had existed is released by tapping the gas just-so. Thanks for your input, and letting me know I\\'m not a complete nut for looking at that!  the Probe used the Vulcan V6 I believe and was not the engine of choice in that car The \\'89-92(?) used the 3.0l Vulcan when the V6 was available, the 93-96 used Mazda\\'s 2.5l V6.Contour OTH did have an OHC V6, (2.5 liter?) and I believe the first \\'Duratech\\'Man was that car fun. 2.5l 170hp V6. It sounded good, and the breathing was aided by the secondary intake runners.Just wanted to keep things up to date.  competitive in this class would put that number at something around 13-14lbs vehicle weight per hp.  competitive in this class would put that number at something around 13-14lbs vehicle weight per hp. Wait, it\\'s not in the same class, but weren\\'t you just holding up BMW as the gold standard :confuse: .Lets see, BMW 328i 3340 pounds and 230 HP...that comes to 14.5 pounds per HP...non-competive, I guess :surprise: .  Lets see, BMW 328i 3340 pounds and 230 HP...that comes to 14.5 pounds per HP...non-competive, I guess :surprise:Or the 335 which is 10 lbs per hp, which comes online at 1400 rpm. Non-competitive :surprise  Can we stop all this mess? HP wars and comparing 55k BMWs to family sedans driven primarily by fat [non-permissible content removed] parents of 2.5 kids and the dog somewhere in the picture. Why is all this about a race? I say all that to say...OK for speed but not overkill (Hear me Camry/Accord/Altima?)Well, I\\'m lying. OK for overkill but be able to handle it around a curve. Oh yeah, no more BMWs.  Are you sure you won\\'t complain if the class moves on to 12-13 lb/HP, and that it won\\'t lose the zoom-zoom factor, again? Interesting thing about this is that the Miata symbolizes zoom-zoom better than any other Mazda. It lead the slogan.  Or the 335 which is 10 lbs per hp, which comes online at 1400 rpm. Non-competitive :surpriseActually, 335i has 45 lb to carry for each HP at 1400 rpm. :shades:  We\\'re losing sight of the topic.  I think the 2008 Accord is much improved over how it absorbs small bumps. As was noted by someone else, with the previous generation Accord, you really could feel every little bump. But those are smoothed out in the 2008 model. Maybe not as isolated as, say, a Buick or Sonata, but to the extent where it\\'s no longer an issue for me. The new Accord also corners flat around curves, no problem there. Seemed to track straight also. The only problem I found with the chassis, and this was with the 16\" tires, was some side-stepping when going around a sharp curve over small bumps (e.g. a cloverleaf). This isn\\'t a major problem, especially for a family sedan, but it just shows the Accord is a fine family sedan but not a sport sedan.  haha, I think past posts have shown some people to have blinders and cherry-pick certain parts of other\\'s posts. Apparently reacting to a complete idea is too difficult so creating a \"strawman\" argument is all that they have left...The idea that HP is all there is to Zoom-Zoom just misses the point. I\\'ve had bicycles that had more zoom-zoom than many of these midsize cars! For people who like to drive but want enough room for business, family or friends, the Mazda6 is a great option that is priced thousands less than competitors in this class.  I think the 2008 Accord is much improved over how it absorbs small bumps. As was noted by someone else, with the previous generation Accord, you really could feel every little bump. But those are smoothed out in the 2008 model.I would definitely expect that of a car with the size and girth of the \\'08.The only problem I found with the chassis, and this was with the 16\" tires, was some side-stepping when going around a sharp curve over small bumps (e.g. a cloverleaf). This isn\\'t a major problem, especially for a family sedan, but it just shows the Accord is a fine family sedan but not a sport sedan.It should be fine at meeting the needs of most people hauling children and going to the grocery store.  I\\'ve had bicycles that had more zoom-zoom than many of these midsize cars! My Cannondale is definitely more zoom-zoomy than the Accord :P  Do we really need flat cornering, and ability to do 0-60 in 7.0 or less to haul children and grocery shopping? \"Family\" sedans have come a long way indeed!  You haven\\'t been at the school drop-off or the grocery store parking lot lately, have you?   Heh. Well, they ALL go my speed, thankyouverymuch...Of course, I have an old 4Runner that looks like and probably COULD drive over their yuppie toys.(lifted a bit, big knobby tires, bars, sliders, etc)  In looking for a small/midsize wagon, did you look at the Legacy at all? I didn\\'t really give Subaru a fair shake, or fair consideration, and I probably should have. I didn\\'t like the styling of any of their vehicles at the time (until maybe this year with some redesigns), and that had a lot to do with it. The other main reason I avoided Subaru was that in back in the 80\\'s my parents got a Subaru wagon, and I guess Subaru tended to under power their cars back then. It was probably one of the most underpowered vehicles I\\'ve ever been in. So I definitely had some outdated bias and perception against Subaru.However, on the plus side, I did notice Subaru was always coming in at #3 reliability wise for the Magnificent Japanese 3. Nissan, Mitsubishi, Izuzu, Suzuki, and Mazda have always been Japanese pretenders. Also, I tend to value high-quality interiors, which is probably why I\\'ve gone the Honda-Audi route.One of my most demanding criteria is that any car I buy must have an exceptional HP & Torgue to miles per gallon ratio. I want great performance w/o sacrificing fuel economy, and that\\'s probably my #1 criteria. I do have to like the style and looks, both inside and out, so that weighs heavily too. And finally, reliability and dependability have come to be my first and foremost criteria due to the ownership experience Chrysler provided to me with my first vehicle being a Dodge. Before my first Dodge, I thought reliability meant little, and as such, dependability was low on my totem pole of consideration. Well, after my domestic experience, I felt the Camry, Civic, Corolla, & Accord models were the furthest away, most different, and totally opposite and polar to the Dodge Experience. So I had to get one no matter how much I hated the styling. Thank god I loved the 2003 Honda Accord redesign and it came JUST IN TIME for my purchase in November of 2002! I had no taste for the looks of the 2002 Accord\\'s from Honda. When purchasing the A3 over the RAV4, I also had test driven with strong cosideration the V50 from Volvo, the 9-3 SportCombi from Saab, Mazda 3 5-door (another tough competitor).Without taking test-drives, I still took serious looks at the Acura TSX, and 325/330 from BMW. The V50 and 9-3 fell apart upon inspection with CR reliability scores and rankings, and while the V50\\'s interior was nice and acceptable (though not my cup of tea), the Saab had a \"poor\" interior to put it mildly. Also, turbo lag was much more noticeable in those 2, whereas in the A3 I wouldn\\'t have known it was a turbo without \"knowing\" it beforehand.The Mazda 3 is basically 75% the car the A3 is, for 70% the cost! So I\\'d concede that technically Mazda provides ever so slightly better value (when the warranties used to be equivalent). I chose to go with the real deal 100% car vs. saving money.The TSX was VERY NICE inside and out, but I just didn\\'t care for the small sedan design with little cargo capability. Also, I felt the specs on the drivetrain screamed for the 3.0 V6 from Honda instead of the fast 4 banger. Acura didn\\'t offer a test drive right off the bat.The BMW dealership seemed snotty and snobish, and didn\\'t seem all that excited at letting me test drive a 3 series vehicle, so I didn\\'t... (though they said I should \"come back to test drive theirs last; after driving all the others.\") Well, I never went back, and they were a bit too overpriced for my taste, and the 328 and super fast 335 do seem like a significant improvements since then, over the slow poke 325 and pricy 330. Also, I don\\'t like to be told to \"come back\" to do a test drive. If the cars are really that good; have me drive it right then and there. After all, it\\'s the drive/acceleration, handling, gas mileage, & build quality that sold the Audi A3.  What do I know. I live in a city my colleagues call \"Family Mound\", and am surrounded by eleven grocery stores within 2 miles, and two schools (and a large day care center) are within quarter mile. It is hard to spot a family sedan among the mammoth-mobiles.  I\\'d seriously consider buying a lower priced MazdaSpeed6 with an AUDI DSG transmission so I can live with Southern CA traffic. I\\'d like to see the interior spruced up too.That would make one helluva car. :P  What are you talking about?? The Mazda6 is up for a redesign, and in 2003 it was just as competitive as the rest of the mid sized sedans. The Mazda3 is STILL a top performer in the compact market. The MX-5 is revered at the #1 roadster of all time. The CX-7 is quicker/ drives better then a Murano/CR-V and others. Most of what you said in your post is true, but what is misleading in the above statements is the following:1) In 2003 there was (since fall of 2002) a 240 HP Accord available, which was not even in the same ballpark as Mazda\\'s offering for midsize cars.2) The CX-7 while quick, cannot match or compete with the ferocity of the RAV4\\'s pure speed down a drag strip.  I agree that the fun in zoom zoom from great handling is far greater than the zoom zoom fun of super fast straight line acceleration. However, a car should not be \"slow\" in either department (speaking to Ford\\'s 3.0 here).  Do we really need flat cornering, and ability to do 0-60 in 7.0 or less to haul children and grocery shopping? \"Family\" sedans have come a long way indeed!No, we need something that can safely transport a typical load (how ever that is defined by each individual) while incurring the minimum cost to the operator and to the environment.We want something that we find a pleasurable and enjoyable place to spend 2-4hrs/day. That is defined differently for different people. Some people like to feel isolated from the outside like their car is a cocoon. Others like to feel connected with the outside world, like their car is an extension of themselves.   1) In 2003 there was (since fall of 2002) a 240 HP Accord available, which was not even in the same ballpark as Mazda\\'s offering for midsize cars.The Mazda has a 10% horsepower deficit to the Honda. I would hardly consider that not in the same ballpark.  So, what was the point?  Powerwise they were. Performance, refinement and fuel economy, however, weren\\'t.  yes, I would suggest you rent a V6 powered Honda from 2003-07 models and take it around redlining it everywhere you go (traffic allowing) of course :P I think you\\'d have some serious fun that isn\\'t in the same ballpark you\\'d have with Ford Duratech 3.0 engined mid-size cars.  yes, I would suggest you rent a V6 powered Honda from 2003-07 models and take it around redlining it everywhere you go (traffic allowing) of courseI think you\\'d have some serious fun that isn\\'t in the same ballpark you\\'d have with Ford Duratech 3.0 engined mid-size cars. I didn\\'t find that to be the case. It reminded me a lot of the Grand Prix rental car I had last time I was in CA. I did test drive the 6spd Accord coupe just to get a frame of reference before I scowered the earth for a sedan, but it just didn\\'t seem worth it. For the price of the Accord V6 sedan, I could\\'ve gotten the MazdaSpeed6.  So, what was the point?Driving a bland sedan that isolates me from everything doesn\\'t do it for me, although admittedly I am in the minority.  I agree that the fun in zoom zoom from great handling is far greater than the zoom zoom fun of super fast straight line acceleration.However, a car should not be \"slow\" in either department (speaking to Ford\\'s 3.0 here).Yeah, I hope to see the next mazda6 get the 0-60 times in the mid to low 5 second range... the mid 6 second range that the current 3.0 liter engine gets is pretty good, but going from stoplight to stoplight is taking way too long... just think of all the extra seconds I could be waiting at a stoplight to turn green!  At some points, things need to be balanced. That is my opinion, of course. If I needed pure connection, I would walk.   At some points, things need to be balanced. That is my opinion, of course.If I needed pure connection, I would walk. Barefoot?okay okay just teasing :PI do realize I am in the minority, I service vehicles myself, I do amateur driving events like autocross and time trial, and I like vehicles to feel/drive a certain way. I was actually pretty surprised at how much I liked the Legacy\\'s handling. The Mazda feels sharper to me too. I posted a quick review of my road trip in the Accord this week, and i realized it does everything moderately well, it just makes it a totally unrewarding experience, in my opinion.  ... it does everything moderately well ...The key to Accord\\'s (and Camry\\'s) success over the years.  However, a car should not be \"slow\" in either department (speaking to Ford\\'s 3.0 here). Well, since I am satisfied with the 2.3 I4 even withan automatic, I\\'m guessing I\\'d find the 3.0 to be more than adequate...but that\\'s just me (oh, and I guess the rest of the world outside the US, too).  1) In 2003 there was (since fall of 2002) a 240 HP Accord available, which was not even in the same ballpark as Mazda\\'s offering for midsize cars.Yes, very true. The Accord did have a higher HP V6. However, that Accord could not handle like a Mazda6, and the 4 cyl\\'s were pretty close in HP. The Mazda6 was also out in 2002, as a 2003 model.The CX-7 while quick, cannot match or compete with the ferocity of the RAV4\\'s pure speed down a drag strip. I hope I see a RAV4 at the drag strip, so I can embarrass him with my 5.0 and make him wish he never got near a strip. A 1/4 mile straight line in an SUV is not a big deal. Now, throwing a 4,000+ SUV into coreners, and having the power to accelerate out of one, totally in control is a different story, something the CX does better   Well, since I am satisfied with the 2.3 I4 even with an automaticI have the MZR 2.3 w/ a 5-speed, and I smile every time I I pass a Accord/Camry on the highway, and see a senior citizen behind the wheel  No offence to the younger Accord/Camry buyers!(grad) :shades:  And Honda and Toyota smile every time a senior citizen purchases one of their cars.   There\\'s something about experience and maturity, I guess. It might take a few a bit longer to learn. Some are born that way.   There\\'s something about experience and maturity, I guess. It might take a few a bit longer to learn. Some are born that wayMaturity is different then dull and lifeless; its a balance some understand, some just miss out   Riding a bullock wagons may be exciting to some, dull to others. Does it not have a place? I think it does. Some just \"learn\" to find a better balance than others. Dull to you, may be. Don\\'t complain.  a little sensitive eh? I don\\'t think anyone is being very serious about the dullness of some of these midsizers, just having a bit of fun... but I do have to ask... what rationale is there to buy a sedan instead of a crossover except for a lower center of gravity and thus better performance? some crossovers have similar gas mileage but benefit from a much larger cargo carrying capacity and often have more comfortable creature comforts for the extra passengers because of a higher roofline. perhaps there is a slight price advantage to a midsize sedan, but not always and it seems the differences are shrinking. for some, sedans are more attractive than crossovers, but the success of the previous gen accord and camry suggests that looks aren\\'t that important. in my view, the main reason to get a midsize sedan is because it handles better than a crossover.  May I ask you to show me a 2WD crossover with mileage as good as a sedan counterpart (with the sedan\\'s best engine)? Here\\'s what I\\'m coming up with...Saturn Outlook v. Saturn Aura 3.6LHonda Pilot v. Honda AccordFord Edge v. Ford Fusion or 2008 TaurusHyundai Veracruz v. Hyundai Sonata or AzeraToyota Highlander v. Toyota Avalon or CamryTo the best of my ability to tell, these Sedans all get better mileage and are quicker than their larger counterparts.If you need seating for 5+ and don\\'t mind ignoring the obvious practicality of a minivan (vans these days come with swiveling seats, dual DVD players, laser cruise control, etc... what more creature comforts does a $35k-$40k shopper need?), a Crossover is fine; even practical if you need AWD. If you are like most people I know with an SUV or Crossover though, a midsize or full size sedan would be more logical (yes, I realize not many people buy things based on logic anymore).  Malibu Maxx, hrmph, hrmph....I\\'m still in mourning that my beloved Maxx is no more with the new platform. There\\'s nothing like a midsize hatch. I get well over 32 mpg on the highway. If I had to replace, I guess it would be a Mazda or the new Hyundai Elantra hatch (09)...  What is the rationale for the \"crossover\" to even exist? All it is a wagon on stilts...why not just go with the wagon?Why did I not get a wagon, then? For me it was price, looks, gas mileage, and the fact that I don\\'t really need one. We have an old minvan and have only used it\\'s hauling capabilities about 2 times per year recently. I figure if the minvan dies it\\'d be cheaper to rent something, pay for delivery, or pick up a little trailer for those rare occasions. I\\'m not one of those handyman, do-it-yourselfer types, though.  Jeffy...you sound like me.I have a 97 Chrysler mini-van and it only takes my wife to work,or to Wal-Mart.Less than 200 miles per month.I bought it new,and maintain it well.Should the engine die or something comparable,it will go to the big junkyard in the sky.BTW..have you checked out the new Chrysler Minis..pretty cool interiors,a much more modern dash than in the previous models.  No, we are out of the minivan stage. We have 2 sedans now. Our\\'s is a \\'97 also, a Windstar though. The current user is my 23 year old daughter, who recently graduated. We told her she can use it for as long as she wants for $25 per month (to cover the difference in insurance). If we have a need for it, we will just \"borrow\" it from her.  I would\\'ve mentioned it had it not been near-death, with the hatch on the chopping block.  Exactly. I have never warmed up to crossover SUVs. I know lots of people like them, but if I\\'m going to buy a big, boxy, lower-fuel-economy, based-on-a-car-chassis vehicle, I figure I may as well get maximum cargo space and passenger comfort and go with a minivan. I don\\'t have a problem being seen in a minivan, although I know some folks won\\'t be caught dead in one. My MPV has the underpinnings of the 626, so it handles great (for a minivan anyway), but is no longer than a mid-sized sedan yet seats up to seven in reasonable comfort, with tons of cargo space available even with four adults inside.I think a 5-door hatch is a great compromise: the styling, handling, fuel economy, and price of a sedan, with almost as much versatility as the small-to-medium crossover SUVs. And if you really need AWD, there\\'s the Outback.  May I ask you to show me a 2WD crossover with mileage as good as a sedan counterpart (with the sedan\\'s best engine)?My thinking is that if you don\\'t care about performance, why would you go with the most powerful engine? And some of the crossovers on your list seat 7, so I think those are the wrong crossovers to be comparing. Here\\'s a quick list of crossovers I would compare (all are i4\\'s except the hyundai where the sante fe only has a v-6 - perhaps I should\\'ve compared their smaller suv...).accord 21-31 vs crv 20-27mazda6 21-28 vs mazda5 21-26camry 21-31 vs rav4 21-27fusion 20-29 vs escape 22-28sonata v6 19-28 vs sante fe v6 19-24At the most, it seems the sedans have maybe a 10% fuel mileage advantage. For some, this 10% may be important, but the extra $150 a year in gas for some crossovers (based on 24mpg avg and $3 gallon gas on 12k miles annually), the extra utility may be worth it. Some have said, just get a wagon... for 08 in this segment, there will be the legacy and vw which isn\\'t a whole lot of choice. All I\\'m saying is IF a buyer doesn\\'t care about performance, I would think the extra utility of a crossover would make sense. But for me (and other buyers of cars like the Mazda6), I DO care about performance and this sedan would torch most crossovers on the fun roads. Of course I have the hatchback, so I have many advantages of a crossover with the handling of a sedan... I don\\'t think I could ask for more than what the Mazda6 offers.  You misspelled. Its not about sensitivity, it is about sensibility. Cross overs may have fairly close EPA ratings, and besides the fact that I\\'m a down to earth guy and prefer to stay farther from the heavens (which does translate to better dynamics of the vehicle), I don\\'t have giants for friends or family. A sedan works just fine. So, I see no reason to compromise dynamics and fuel economy adding to extra ownership costs. And I don\\'t rely on EPA ratings.You quoted 20/27 mpg for CRV and 21/31 mpg for Accord. Doesn\\'t sound like much difference, right? (unless you look at highway mileage) The CR-V\\'s rating is identical to re-rated fuel economy for my 1998 Accord (which was 23/30 under old standard). But, here is the reality. I average 26 mpg in mixed driving in the Accord. It also gets me 32 mpg with average speed around 75 mph. If CRV could do that, I will be VERY pleasantly surprised, much less be close to the new Accord.Even 10% can be a big number for some like me. I drive about 2000 miles/month. So, while $30/month may not sound like much, over five years it may add up to an additional $2K. But, comparison to CRV is fictitious since I haven\\'t spent enough time to really know what it delivers. A recent road trip on a rental RAV4 just confirmed why they don\\'t make much sense to me. I averaged 23.8 mpg with 90-95% freeway driving, at about 70 mph. It was AWD/I-4, but it is over 8 mpg worse than my observed mileage in my TL and Accord on the same road trip (but going faster).Fuel economy is important to me. A reason, I\\'m seriously contemplating next Fit, even over the Accord. It offers the utility of those cross overs, with an anticipated 40-50% improvement in real world fuel economy as that can be big in the future.  The thing is all your comparisons are off by one size class. For example the CRV is a compact not midsize, it is sized about like a Civic (wagon). It is not Accord size, it is 13 inches shorter and wheelbase is 5 inches less (and I am comparing the 2007 Accord, not the new larger one).I just had a Mazda 5 as a loaner it is like a Mazda 3 minivan...or more of a microvan. I did not look up the Rav4, but I am guessing it is Corolla sized. I also am not sure on the Santa Fe.The Edge is the fusion sized vehicle, not the escape.Try comparing price and mileage of midsize crossover to midsize sedans.  I have wondered if there were drawbacks to keyless entry. From reading this article, there are times when it can be a real problem. http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4025056  That is actually about keyless ignition, not keyless entry. \"Keyless entry\" means you press button on remote to enter the car, but still stick key in to start it. Valet Parking :confuse: what\\'s that? At most, I think I\\'ve turned my car over to someone to park once in my 30 years of driving.  Keyless ignition for a number of makes is a problem in that it can be hacked in 30 seconds with a laptop and your car gone in 60.  you know if you take lets say 4 cars, a Mazda6 DT V6, a Camry SE V6, an Accord SE V6, and lastly an Altima SE 3.5 and put all three on a road course (Lime Rock comes to mind) you will have a very hard time finding a course confining enough that the Mazda would\\'nt lose easily to the other three. Why - simply because it can not pick up enough in the corners to make up for what it loses coming out of them. I guess this is what \\'zoom-zoom\\' is all about, or should I be allowing the Mazda extra points because it \\'feels\\' the best being the slowest (in terms of lap times). Of course, \\'any zoom-zoom\\' quotient is going to have a lot to do with what is under the hood, the reason to lament the loss of the Speed6. Mazda may indeed have some vehicles that they \\'zoom-zoom\\' about - just not the 6, anymore.  Mazda62007 Edmunds Editors Most Wanted Sedan under $25000quote-The 2007 Mazda 6 and Mazdaspeed 6 stand as symbols of what a midrange sedan should be, compromising nothing and surpassing expectations on almost every level.-endHmmmm....  Still wouldn\\'t buy it.  Edmunds may want it, nobody else seems to care.  Just because YOU don\\'t care doesn\\'t mean others don\\'t care. I see many Mazda6\\'s driving around my area. I guess those people cared enough to buy one. If I were going to buy a car right now, the Mazda6i Value Edition would be on my short list. For around $16k, it\\'s a fine car and a great value, IMO. Oh, I forgot... I\\'m \"nobody.\" :P  Forget ME, if others cared, wouldn\\'t a \"most wanted\" mainstream car actually sell better than Mazda6 does? Thru September 2006, Mazda had sold 52.5K units, and this year, the number is at 44K. What makes for a \"most wanted\" car? Is its \"want\" being limited by production? Or is it limited by demand? I would love for you to explain that, instead of trying to jump on my throat. Unless, most wanted is from fleet sales perspective (with 42.7% fleet sales based in 2007 mid-year registrations, Mazda6 happens to be one of the leaders).It doesn\\'t speak for the car itself but that is the reality, not an opinion (for that, see Edmunds, and a bunch of posts here, including yours). So, there is no need to be overly defensive.  yup, you\\'re sensitive (and no, I didn\\'t mis-spell thankyouverymuch). I don\\'t think backy was being defensive... he was just saying that since you can buy a Mazda6 in some markets for 6k off msrp, it is a really good value especially if the buyer likes a good handling midsize car. And because it is a very good value right now because of soft demand, more people than nobody, as you put it, would be willing to consider the car. It\\'s not his fault you exaggerated a bit in your first post and he called you on it; that\\'s not being defensive. Getting upset because you had to retract your statement is...Personally, I think the problem of low sales #\\'s of the mazda6 has to do with bad marketing and not because the car is bad. The average buyer of a midsize sedan is probably older than where mazda\\'s marketing is directed. I understand that mazda wants to target a young demographic (it currently has the second youngest buyer of it\\'s cars compared to other brands - scion is the youngest) but I think a midsize sedan needs to be marketed as much more than zoom-zoom or a company with a successful racing heritage since I think most middle-aged buyers could care less about these things. Yes it\\'s true many car enthusiasts would consider the mazda6 the zoomiest in this segment, but it\\'s also very comfortable, very safe, and extremely practical which is rarely mentioned in mazda6 commercials. I think if Mazda wants it\\'s sales of the 6 to reach it\\'s potential, they really need to reconsider it\\'s emphasis on zoom-zoom at the expense of the Mazda6\\'s other desireable traits.  you know if you take lets say 4 cars, a Mazda6 DT V6, a Camry SE V6, an Accord SE V6, and lastly an Altima SE 3.5 and put all three on a road course (Lime Rock comes to mind) you will have a very hard time finding a course confining enough that the Mazda would\\'nt lose easily to the other three. Why - simply because it can not pick up enough in the corners to make up for what it loses coming out of them. I guess this is what \\'zoom-zoom\\' is all about, or should I be allowing the Mazda extra points because it \\'feels\\' the best being the slowest (in terms of lap times).That may be true, I don\\'t know really since I don\\'t race cars for a living. But I do know that when I test drove these cars on streets, the Mazda6 surpassed the Accord and Altima in cornering grip, stopping power, and steering feel which are all important for maintaining control of your car. It\\'s not the fastest in a straight line (the mazda6 v6 will do mid 6 second 0-60 where the cars you mention will do this in the low 6\\'s) but it feels more connected when driving on the street. I\\'ll leave race car driving to the pro\\'s and when you find out who wins, let me know. You may also want to tell the SCCA Touring Car points leaders (both individual points leaders and manufacturer\\'s points leaders) about your opinions too so that they quit refuting your \"racing theories\" by winning in their Mazda6\\'s over cars that have more power than them :surprise:  How much power do your really need to drive on the streets (which is where these cars will actually be driven), anyway? In other markets the mazda6 does not even offer the V6. I just read a review that said of the european base 120bhp, 1.8 L I4... \"it\\'s fine for what it has to do\". The full quote being:The petrol engines are revvy and eager, and if the 1.8 feels as if it\\'s been ballasted with concrete after the other two, which feel closer for performance, it\\'s fine for what it has to do. The \"revy and eager\" engines referred to are a 147bhp 2.0 and the new four-cylinder 2.5 with 170bhp, replacing the 164bhp 2.3. It\\'s funny that these same engines would be called underpowered, slow, etc. here in the US.http://www.whatcar.com/news-article.aspx?NA=228559BTW, anyone know what specific elements make the new styling Japanese rather than European?  understand that in Europe the car buyers expectations and values are different - by necessity. Displacement taxes and petrol prices make the 250hp+ V6 cars we enjoy here in this country impractical (and expensive) to drive. So therefore Mazda not offering a V6 overseas or the predominance of little more fuel efficient 4 bangers in not strange at all, as neither are those standards in relation to Hp which certainly means less and handling/braking which tends to mean more. The Toyota Avalon is a US market car only made in the US, and is reasonably economical and would handle 130-140 mph autobahns just fine. It is also too large for the roads over there, definitely emphasizes ride over handling (not the European preference) and has a V6 engine that by European definitions is simply too large.  This is not about sensitivity and defensiveness...very good questions are being asked.If mazda(and Nissan) wants to reach a broader buying community, the advertising compaign should be rethought. They are targeting 18 year olds.  they really need to reconsider it\\'s emphasis on zoom-zoom at the expense of the Mazda6\\'s other desireable traits. see we now agree - for those younger demographic folk (the average age of an Accord buyer is supposedly now 50!) that \\'zoom-zoom\\' might appeal to, should be turned off a bit by the 6s lack of straight line capabilities when considering them in relation to all the other cars in this group. Sell price if they must, or sell safety (braking-handling) if true, but not something (zoom) that would have many expecting a car with competitive power to go along with that better handling.  When I was a kid,every car I owned had to be tested in a street drag race.It was a part of being a guy growing up in the \\'50s.Now that I\\'m all growed(sic) up,I care about comfort,dependability,economy and efficiency.Frankly,I dont even worry about handling as I dont do any racing of any kind.I feel perfectly safe even driving my lumbering 97 Chrysler mini-van.My new KIA Optima seems nimble,but I dont notice that it \"handles\" any better than any other car of any size or type.  I think another reason that Mazda6 sales are not higher is that the car is at the end of its run. Some people, like robertsmx, might see the car as \"ho hum, the same old 6 I\\'ve seen for five years.\" There are many newer models that might be garnering buyer\\'s attention. For example, the Fusion may be taking sales from the Mazda6--it\\'s based on the same platform, but has more interior room, some may prefer the styling, and it\\'s an \"American car\" (made in Mexico, vs. the Mazda6 that is made in Michigan, but it\\'s perception). And the Fusion starts at around $15k (stripped, but it draws people into the dealerships). That the \\'ol Mazda6 cxn still draw critical acclaim attests to its fundamental goodness. Just like the previous-gen Accord, which was still garnering praise at the end of its life, although its sales had to be propped up with huge incentives--just like what is happening now with the Mazda6. Let\\'s see whether sales pick up when the all-new Mazda6 debuts next year.  anyone know what specific elements make the new styling Japanese rather than European? Interesting question, but I will use one of my friends&#146; take on it (he wouldn&#146;t drive anything but a BMW 3-series, until now).Japanese designs tend to have more curves and lines, sometimes letting the feel of bigger vehicles than they actually are. European designs (specifically German) tend to be tighter, cleaner, generally designed to reduce perception of size. The sheet metal is generally flat for most part, complemented by just a few lines.For that reason, my friend thinks the new Accord looks more German than the new 3-series which he says looks more Japanese.   Let\\'s see whether sales pick up when the all-new Mazda6 debuts next year. I agree. Let\\'s see how the up comming Mazda6 does in performance and sales figures compared to the out going Mazda6, and others in it\\'s class. It is no secret that the current Mazda6 is outdated. If performance and sales increase, then it is a success. But, right now, comparing a 5 year old, almost 6 year old design to the new Accord/Camry/Altima is just worthless.  my friend thinks the new Accord looks more German than the new 3-series which he says looks more Japanese. I would disagree with the Accord statement, especialy with the giant face of the Accord, and huge head lamps. However, from a side profile, I can see it, except for the little wheels.I think the new 3 series does look like a Japanese car. Front end looks a lot like a Mazda3. The 3 coupe looks very German, though.  Not necessarily. The 5-year-old Accord was still winning comparisons against new-for-2006 or 2007 competitors from Chrysler, Saturn, Kia, Nissan, and Toyota. Age wasn\\'t a handicap in that case apparently. We HAVE to compare the 6 to these new designs because at the moment, it is all Mazda has to offer. They really don\\'t have a choice.  However, from a side profile, I can see it, except for the little wheels. I never thought I\\'d see the day when 17\" wheels were \"little.\" :P  I think another reason that Mazda6 sales are not higher is that the car is at the end of its run.perhaps, but may also be because Mazda doesn\\'t enjoy that same \"Japanese car\" image that some others do? Camcordimas sell at a rate of 1 million vehicles per year. The buyer of \\'family sedans\\' is older than who Mazda seems to want to sell to - as kdshapiro points out - there are only a limited number of 18 year olds that can buy any car, never mind a new one.  Mazda probably will never come close to the Accord/Camry territory, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not a good car, even as the current generation comes to a close. Different strokes for different folks, but to say no ones cares is a bit ignorant.  It might sell better initially, but better designs are expected to hold well over time. Mazda6 hasn\\'t sold well, at least not over last 2-3 years, and this despite of being a high volume fleet sales car.As an observer (thats about as far as I will go, given the choices around), Mazda6 is probably underappreciated in the market, but its orientation is more as an alternative to other lifestyle vehicles like Passat than truly be seen as a competitor to established midsizers like Accord, Altima and Camry.  but to say no ones cares is a bit ignorant. Stop taking words literally. I posted sales numbers, didn\\'t I? If people were rushing to buy Mazda6, wouldn\\'t it actually do better?  Tiny wheels? And in another board, I\\'ve been complaining about Honda\\'s new found tendency to go overboard with wheel size. If P225/50/R17 (25.86\") is \"tiny\", then P235/45/R18 (26.3\") wheels on Accord coupe must be about average. :surprise: Perhaps some will want to upgrade to 19\"20\" rims. Thats the way to go, right?Even Civic now has BMW 328i sized rims (and I\\'m not talking Civic Si). And we wonder why cars keep gaining weight... 40-50 lb right there.As for headlamps, Accord has always had the shape, and it seems proportionate to the size of the car (compared to the past). Don\\'t think it is any bigger than my 1998 (perhaps more perception because of the way it tapers). Honda could have done away with the bulge though (and has in the coupe). Right there is some Japanese influence.  No one said people were rushing to buy the 6, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not a good car. If everyone went by sales figures for their purchase criterion, then we might well just have one car only for everyone. Like I said, different strokes for different people. FWIW, the demographic of the segement generally has a perference for ride over handling. Also, a lot of people doesn\\'t even know the Mazda brand if you had asked them, depsite the popularity of the MX-5 and 3.  No one said people were rushing to buy the 6, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not a good car.Did I say that it wasn\\'t? Just that it wasn\\'t \"most wanted\", because if it were, it would sell. Why is it that a \"most wanted\" car, which is well within price range and not limited by production, struggles to sell?  Editors\\' Most Wanted Vehicles for 2007 Every year, the Edmunds.com editors gather to ponder that eternal question, \"What cars or trucks would we most want to park in our garage?\" For the 2007 model year our editors have once again scoured the entire automotive spectrum looking for their favorite vehicles. What they\\'ve came up with are the Edmunds.com Editors\\' Most Wanted cars and trucks for 2007.Reading comprehension > you  Can\\'t speak for the editors at Edmunds, but reading comprehension would be an issue if I actually read the article (and I tend to skip virtually all that Edmunds\\' has to say). I went by the title of the thread in discussion \"most wanted\".   You are forgetting that the Mazda6 is the \"most wanted car\" by the editors of Edmunds.com--not the general public. The editors probably have different criteria than that of the general public, e.g. maybe the editors appreciate crisp handling, while the average family-car buyer would rather buy an \"appliance\" car like the Camry, the #1 seller in this class, which is more boring to drive but has (or used to have?) rock-solid dependability.To someone\\'s comment that the 6 is targeted at 18-year-olds... or maybe at 50-year-olds who think young?   as kdshapiro noted Nissan\\'s marketing and product bias is somewhat similar to Mazda\\'s but it works for them (perhaps being a little more mainstream) to the tune of 200-300,000 Altimas a year - imagine a Mazda6 with a 270hp Nissan VQ engine - now that truly would be \\'zoom-zoom\\' - or maybe they already tried that with the MS6 and it didn\\'t work?  maybe at 50-year-olds who think young?They are buying BMW 3-series.  Count number of V6 powered Altima on the road. You will be surprised. They aren\\'t as rare as V6 powered Camrys but I don\\'t see many of them on the road.Focus should not be placed on low volume offering. Refining the seller would be the key, and that means, four cylinder engine.  down here in Texas the Altima actually outsells the Accord (but not the Camry) and according to my dealer (and judging by his inventory) 3 out of every 4 are 4 bangers - a ratio I suggest you\\'ll generally find in Camcords. In things like Fulans/6s/Sonatas would guess that a far greater percentage are V6s (50-50+?)if for no other reason than price. The Altima has generally been offered with the most powerful engines in this class since 2002 - 4 and 6 cylinder. Part of the reason for the younger buyer, I guess.  Part of the reason for the younger buyer, I guess. Not to mention the boy-racer Altezza-style lamps. I\\'m 20, and these don\\'t appeal to me.  you therefore must not really care for the looks of the Fulan or 6 either?  Not particularly. I really don\\'t care for the cheap taillamps of the Fusion. In a $20k car, there should be a seperate blinking bulb from the brake/taillamp (the Explorer, Expedition, F150, etc.. all suffer from this, as do many American cars. If the foreign guys could seperate the blinker in the 70s or 80s, the Americans should do this on all its cars by now.   So, if you are correct about the very different ratios of V6 to I4 engines, maybe in the actual on-the-road fleet of cars, the Mazda6, Fusion, and Milan have greater average HP than the Altima, Camry, or Accord.  I prefer better sources on numbers than what a dealer has to provide. And, I\\'m in Texas actually. Altima 3.5SE/SL is a rare sight, Camry V6 is rarer. V6 is most common with Accord among the Japanese trio. And even with Accord, Honda forecasts half of sales will be of EX/EX-L trims (probably based on the past). It used to be LX trim back in late 90s.Nissan has made HP a selling point for a long time. When Accord I-4 topped out at 145 HP, Altima had 150 HP. When Honda upped the output (1998 Accord) to 150 HP, Nissan added 5 HP to Altima. At this time, Accord V6 had 200 HP (Maxima had 190 HP). A year or two later, Maxima went up to 222 HP. At this point, Acura TL had 225 HP, and Infiniti had to one-up it with 227 HP.When 2003 Accord V6 arrived with 240 HP, Nissan bumped Altima to 245 HP (a similar trend can be seen between Infiniti and Acura). It may have helped Nissan grab headlines, however (nobody remember Pontiac Grand Prix\\'s 240 HP motor). Clearly, Nissan has marketed it well.To be honest, I am a little disappointed with Honda trying to stay on top in power game. Personally, I would rather have lower but more usable top end. As it is now, Accord\\'s 268 HP can be used only in second gear, and above 65-70 mph, useful only in highway passing situations. While doing spec sheet/mag racing, it is easy to lose sight of this fundamental reality.  really doubt that this is s function of cost - how much can an extra light bulb cost - not to mention the now more commonplace LED assemblies which can certainly take the costs of repair to new heights.  It\\'s not the bulb that would add cost, but I\\'m guessing extra engineering cost. Something Ford doesn\\'t have much of I\\'m thinking. I know it\\'s nit-picky, but hey, I\\'m allowed to be when it is my car, right?   That has been a long time pet peeve of mine. It is clearly an effect of cost cutting, because when it comes to going slightly upscale, these automakers do adjust. Take Saturn Aura and its identical twin Pontiac G6. Inside that shiny plastic stuff in the Aura, Saturn did incorporate multi-function arrangement that the Pontiac doesn&#146;t have. I think Ford does it on Milan but not on Fusion (could be wrong, but haven&#146;t seen that car from rear up close much).And then there is that back up light. I have noticed in some GM vehicles that the back up light stays on if the lights are left on with doors locked. This provides an impression that the vehicle is in reverse gear when in reality, it is actually parked. But this is a whole another story.  And then there is that back up light. I have noticed in some GM vehicles that the back up light stays on if the lights are left on with doors locked. This provides an impression that the vehicle is in reverse gear when in reality, it is actually parked. But this is a whole another story. This is to provide perimeter lighting when entering or exiting the car in the dark (when lights are on). Quite handy in a dark lot/parking deck.  I continue to be amused by the Zoom-Zoom mentality of today\\'s automotive testers/reviewers and the horsepower race among manufacturers.I believe the Zoom-Zoom ads work because: A) They appeal to younger drivers;  They appeal to older drivers who want to be younger drivers.The horsepower races are another story. Just how much git up and go does a mid-size sedan really need anyway? Are 0-60 times really relevant in a meaningful way?Our 2007 3.0-liter Duratec V6 SEL AWD Ford Fusion does the 0-60 run in about 7.5 to 8.0 seconds, making it one of the slowest V6s in the segment, yet it\\'s a much better time than some of the so-called muscle cars of yesteryear.Our car is plenty fast for our needs and the engine is tried and true. (Read dependable.) I don\\'t believe that people who participate in these automotive forums are \"typical\" owners, instead falling into the category of \"enthusiasts.\"But it stands to reason that there should be more Accord and Camry participants simply because there are more Camcord owners, by far, to begin with. Fusion and Mazda owners are greatly outnumbered.The good thing about the mid-size segment is that most all of the cars are now competitive when it comes to features, performance, price. While the Camcords far outsell the rest, the qualities of the others are now apparent, too.Comparisons of these mid-sizers amount to splitting hairs and subjective matters, like styling. To be sure, the Fusions have the most distinctive styling: They don\\'t resemble anything else. That is a huge plus in my book but might be a minus in someone else\\'s. (There\\'s no mistaking the first Edsel for anything else either.  )Will Ford, GM or Chrysler ever produce a mid-size that outsells the Camry or Accord? I seriously doubt it, unless Toyota or Honda stumbles terribly. That is not likely.Still, FoMoCo would be well-advised to renew its old slogan, \"Have you driven a Ford lately?\" because of all the advances it has made in the last five years or so. The Fusion is a prime example of this.  I suppose if someone wants to drop $35k+ on a compact car, they will buy a 3 Series. Other people who \"think young\" might get something like a Mazda6, or even a Mazda3 or something like a Fit. Lots of choices for young-thinking drivers that cost less than a 3 Series.   and I\\'ll agree that 7 or 8 second 0-60, or 16-18 sec quarter miles is \\'plenty quick\\' by yesterday\\'s definitions and for that matter any real practical definition. I guess the point really is - what if you can have 6 sec 0-60 and still be able to expect 30mpg highway - there are some cars in this group that\\'ll do that. If you told me that I could get 35 or 40 mpg by sacrificing that 50 hp (or so) then you would have a point, but that doesn\\'t seem to be the way this works - with that\\'unnecessary\\' 270 hp comes the efficiency needed for the the FE. Have your cake and eat it too anybody?   If you told me that I could get 35 or 40 mpg by sacrificing that 50 hp (or so) then you would have a point, but that doesn\\'t seem to be the way this works - with that\\'unnecessary\\' 270 hp comes the efficiency needed for the the FE. Have your cake and eat it too anybody? I get 35MPG+ (usually 37-39) regularly on the highway in my 4-cyl Accord when running 75MPH. I guess I\\'m having some particularly efficient cake. Carrot cake maybe?   To someone\\'s comment that the 6 is targeted at 18-year-oldsWho ever posted that is pretty ignorant. Many 18yr olds are not capable of purchasing a vehicle.This according to Mazda: \" Mazda6 buyers tend to be in their mid to late 30\\'s and lead busy lives while exhibiting a \\'bring it on\\' attitude. Financially comfortable, they own their own home and live in an urban or suburban area.The Mazda6 Sports Sedan is targeted at vehicle enthusiasts who believe midsized cars can be fun and youthful in addition to sophisticated, comfortable and practical. The Mazda5 5-door caters to those who want sport-coupe styling with the functionality of 5 doors. The Mazda6 Sport Wagon directs itself at those who desire a combination of utility and performance.\"This was written 5 years ago, people.  Its a nuisance. And those lights do nothing to light up the surrounding area (which is only the rear).  I beg to differ. They light up the area you are backing up into, so you can see at night. Trust me, I back into a space every night. The reverse lights light up the path for me. They may not be REALLY bright, but work instead like puddle lamps. They provide enough light in my deep dark yard to park between the house and the other Accord.  BMWs sell on lease for most part, and they are very impressive deals. Besides, there is the used car market. If it is about looking cool and young, one could do better than see oneself in an economical mainstream car. Most folks around 50 are expected to be in a better financial position as well.And then, there is the Accord, and Altima, and Camry, if not those two-seat sports cars (interestingly enough, most Solstice/Sky drivers that I have noticed are older).  When you have locked the vehicle, you\\'re not really backing up into something (that is the purpose of the lamp). It isn\\'t supposed to provide illumination.When someone at a parking lot has parked the vehicle and left (assumiung the lights go off in 30 seconds or so), a person entering the lot may stop as a courtesy (or caution) to let the car back up (again, the purpose of the mandated reverse lamp). Not backing up can create a dangerous situation because it leaves other people guessing.If there is a need for puddle light, it should be done in the rear, like it is done up front. Reverse lamp should be left for what it is supposed to be. But, we\\'re digressing from the topic. I don\\'t remember having seen midsize sedans with it (except those with reverse lights gone wrong). :shades:  actual on-the-road fleet of cars, the Mazda6, Fusion, and Milan have greater average HP than the Altima, Camry, or Accord. So- your V6 Fulans etc. would also be consuming a whole lot more fuel as well - what exactly is your point, that only those mfgrs. of Camcordimas can seem to make 4 cylinder engines that you can live with or that Fulans/6s/Sonatas are cheaper? I think we already knew both those things.  think that the upcoming diesel Accord may redefine these parameters, providing probably 30mpg overall and hwy approaching 50 mpg. The biggest thing since the Prius if FE means a lot to you.  30 mpg overall won\\'t be a huge incentive, given that I already get 26 mpg in my Accord in mixed driving. And thats an Accord from ten years ago and 182K miles. Then I figure in $2.65/gallon for regular grade gasoline versus $3.10/gallon for diesel that I saw couple of days ago in my neighborhood.Diesels may be promising, but I will believe it, when I see it. The way most folks drive, it is rather hard to get good mileage. And I\\'m not talking high speed, quite the opposite actually. :P  was really talking new EPS \\'City\\' 30 mpg - and I understand your 26 mpg, that\\'s what my wife gets on her Altima 3.5 and FTM what I get on my Avalon albeit with a high percentage of hwy in the mix. Had the opputunity to drive the E320CDI a few months back, it is car that \\'feels\\' quick because of all its torque, a rather constant reminder of what engine braking is all about, posts similar power numbers to MBs 3.5 liter high tech (premium gas) V6, but also will run about 10-15 miles further on gallon of fuel. There is a recent article about it in CR.May be the immediate future these clean diesels.  Mazda6 buyers tend to be in their mid to late 30\\'s and lead busy lives while exhibiting a \\'bring it on\\' attitude. Financially comfortable, they own their own home and live in an urban or suburban area. Mazda can say anything it wants, and maybe that explains why the are not head and heels above Honda.  FMVSS says a vehicle should have separate bulbs for tail-lamp and stop-turn. The most common bulb is the 1157NA dual filament and one of the filaments does the tail lamp while the other is the combined stop-turn. There is a allowance in there for vehicles with amber signals in the rear.Many people like the look of the solid color vs the 3 color tail lamp lenses. You will also notice trailers are almost always a single dual filament red bulb.The outgoing Accord was also all red.  In most vehicles, removing the key from the ignition or simply turning the ignition to off disables the reverse lights. This is pretty important since most manual transmission vehicles are left in reverse when parked.In slushbox vehicles, the key won\\'t come out with the car in gear, so that layer of confusion is mostly eliminated, while the path is illuminated.  The issue isn\\'t about color of the lens, but having functions separated. My TL has all red lens but LED clusters in two rows serve as night/brake lamps, and there is an additional bulb for side indicator, plus one (each side) for reverse which has to be white. There are four bulbs in each cluster in the tail lamp of my Accord. One for side indicator, one for reverse and two for night lamp/brakes.The problem starts when there is just one bulb for side, night and brake lamp duties.  The outgoing Accord was also all red. Yes, I\\'m aware (I\\'ve got a 2006, my dad\\'s 2005 was all red as well). That\\'s not what I take issue with. It may be all red, but the \"brake\" lamp is seperate from the blinker. See what I mean?On cars like the Fusion, say you are turning left. Hit the brakes with your signal on, and you get the CHMSL, and the right brakelight. There is no seperate left brakelight. I was behind a Taurus (2000-2004) whose CHMSL was burned out, and there was a sunlight glare on the opposing brakelight when they were turning left. I couldn\\'t tell they were slowing down to turn as opposed to just changing lanes.  Mazda can say anything it wants, and maybe that explains why the are not head and heels above Honda. That is the target audience, aka demographic. What does that have to do with being \"not head and heels above Honda\"? I don\\'t understand. Some here do not realize that Mazda does not have the manufacturing capacity of Honda. Mazda will never outsell Honda, because they cannot produce more cars then them. Plus, Honda goes for the masses, while Mazda goes for the enthusiast, and starting to expand upon that.  I don\\'t think the question is of outselling, but of selling well. In another thread a discussion is around Honda Fit. It isn\\'t a car that is selling in big numbers. The reasons are there, but one of them doesn\\'t include \"no demand\".  If it is about looking cool and young, one could do better than see oneself in an economical mainstream car. It\\'s not. It\\'s about feeling young. I really don\\'t give a rodent\\'s rear end what other people think of me as they see me drive by.Most folks around 50 are expected to be in a better financial position as well. Meaning, if someone makes good money, they will naturally want to spend it on a $35k+ compact car rather than on something else that interests them--like maybe retiring early? What is wrong with driving a car that is less expensive than you can afford to buy?If I did buy a 3 Series someday, it would be a used one.  Some here do not realize that Mazda does not have the manufacturing capacity of Honda. Mazda will never outsell Honda,Mazda never being able to outsell Honda is a function of demand not plant capacities - rest assured if enough people really wanted the 6, Mazda would be more than happy to build new plants (or convert closing Ford plants) to accommodate it. Then they could have problems like Chrysler has to this day - too much inventory from using some of that capacity and no buyers despite \\'lifetime\\' warranties that should be more properly termed \\'company lifetime - subject to the fine print contained hereon\\'.Besides which, the day that they can sell all the 6s they can make, at whatever level that is, is probably the same day that they can stop offering 20-30% discounts on it.  ...if enough people really wanted the 6, Mazda would be more than happy...to accommodate it. Then they could have problems like Chrysler has to this day...Sounds like that would be a great plan...be like Chrysler :sick:  If its about feeling young again, I think a family sedan won\\'t cut it. Younger folks don\\'t buy or lean towards 4-door family sedans. Their coupe versions, may be. Which may explain why, at least in case of Hondas, the average age of coupe buyers, be it Civic or Accord, is about five years less than sedan buyers.Older folks who \"feel\" old, buy Avalon, the Buicks, Cadillacs, Lincolns etc, obviously depending on their budget. I just don\\'t see older folks who want to \"feel\" younger (I wonder why that would be the case), would skip Accord, Camry or Altima. I somehow can\\'t envision them competing with their kids (and their friends) in making their own choices.What is wrong with driving a car that is less expensive than you can afford to buy? There is nothing wrong. But in America, things don\\'t work that way. If you can\\'t afford to buy, you lease (especially true with BMW folks, I know quite a few). There\\'s a $0 down/$299/month campaign running on 3-series right now. Thats not bad. OTOH, a typical buyer, putting $5K down, might pay $450/month on \"buying\" an Accord.  I somehow can\\'t envision them competing with their kids (and their friends) in making their own choices. agreed, The older I get the less I would care about what others might think, whereas my 25 year old son does care what his peers think about his fancy dan SUV and probably similarily little about what his father thinks of it.  Not in all cases.My parents own a car that, if you take sticker price, is 1/9th of their combined total income. They only have the one car. They always buy brand new.They have other investments, such as a condo at the beach. They have said why spend that much money on something that\\'ll depreciate, when I\\'m perfectly happy with this?  JD Powers has demographic information on their website. Here are some numbers for percent of buyers in the 16-35 age range for various midsize sedans:Malibu 13%Sebring 19%Accord 20%Aura 22%Camry 27%G6 30%Fusion 31%Altima 37%Mazda6 39%Legacy 46%  I just don\\'t see older folks who want to \"feel\" younger (I wonder why that would be the case), would skip Accord, Camry or Altima.You\\'re wondering why \"older folks\" who want to feel younger would skip a Camry? I think that\\'s pretty clear, isn\\'t it? Have you driven a Camry vs. a Mazda6 lately?Tell me the generally-available real-world price of an Accord, Camry, or Altima with the following equipment, and I\\'ll give you a few reasons--actually a few thousand reasons--why people might go for the Mazda6, handling and looks aside:17\" alloysSport seats with power driver\\'s seatGround effects and rear spoilerI4 with 5-speed manumaticCD changer  I would like to know where JD Powers found 16 year olds buying these cars.  \"Older folks who \"feel\" old, buy Avalon, the Buicks, Cadillacs, Lincolns etc, obviously depending on their budget.\"I guess that there is always an exception to the rule, but I certainly don\\'t feel any \"older\" driving my Avalon at 29.  Yes there are. I, for one, was about 20 years younger than an average Accord sedan buyer. But with middle ground cars like the Accord, there is a potential to attract people from both ends of the spectrum, and in the middle.I guess, some things never change. Found this related article from ten years ago (on MY1998 Accord):\"Honda marketers see coupe and sedan buyers sharing many demographics, with an average age in the 30\\'s to 50\\'s and household income of $60,000.\" (link)That would be the age to target, with a family sedan/coupe.  When you\\'re 65, you can drive a Civic Si 6-speed with a coffee can muffler. I\\'m with you man. I\\'m 6\\'4\" and appreciate a roomy sedan (Accord driver here).  Besides which, the day that they can sell all the 6s they can make, at whatever level that is, is probably the same day that they can stop offering 20-30% discounts on it. Mazda is not offering those discounts, privately owned dealers are. Mazda North American Operations is offering less then 10% off from MSRP.  Older folks that might go for Avalon, might go with Camry (the younger version). They are not going to jump into something that hurts their bottom (these folks like those kind of cars for a reason). As a result, they will have better alternatives. Again, if style was truly important, why go with four door sedan? Accord Coupe (if one can find one sitting at the lot) or Altima Coupe would do a far better job.And really, are their 50 year olds who wouldn\\'t feel younger without ground effects, rear spoiler and 17\" alloys? BTW, I\\'ve seen you mention 17\" rims more than once. Other than base Accord sedan, wider 17\" rims are standard in most trims (and all trims of coupe, except 6MT which gets 18\").why people might go for the Mazda6I will keep my eyes open for a 50-year old trying to feel younger in his/her Mazda6.  I don\\'t think the question is of outselling, but of selling wellThere is no question that the sales have sunk. I am not debating that. However, when the 6 came out, it was a big success for Mazda. The Mazda6 is now 5 years old, and in dire need of an overhaul. Lets see how the new 6 does, and bring the topic up again then.  Instead of sales talk, we can talk of the cars themselves.  Again, if style was truly important, why go with four door sedan? Who said style was truly important? You did, not I. Just because someone likes driving something sportier than a Camry doesn\\'t mean he/she doesn\\'t have kids (maybe BIG kids) to haul around, or other adults. Coupes are great if you don\\'t need to use the rear seat often. That\\'s not my situation.What is that real-world selling price then for the Accord with the 17\" alloys? The lowest-priced model like that is the EX I4, isn\\'t it? What does that go for? Anywhere near $16k? Even with 16\" alloys and power seat, we\\'re looking at a LX-P. What do those go for with the 5-speed AT? Anywhere close to $16k?  Instead of sales talk, we can talk of the cars themselves.Thumbs up!!  Imagine....1. I\\'m standing on the corner.

I don\\'t get to decide that, but it seems like the sales horse is dead and bloody (we all know sales for the 6 are down). I still think it is worthy of discussion (the car, anyway) since it is on sale, and the only competitor Mazda has in this race at the moment.  If you weren\\'t talking style, may be I missed you point around getting underbody kit, spoilers and 17\" rims. What was it?What is that real-world selling price then for the Accord with the 17\" alloys?What is the point of 17\" alloys? I thought you didn\\'t care for style. In your words: \"Who said style was truly important? You did, not I\" Accord LX-P probably can be had for about $20K (which would be close to its invoice), no less. But Accord LX-S (the base coupe) likely won\\'t be available to even touch for a while much less haggle on it. But that speaks about demand and supply more than anything.If Mazda could find 50 year olds who want to feel young, I doubt you would be seeing $5K off MSRP (which I see you\\'re).  but it seems like the sales horse is dead and bloody You are not going to hear me disagree with that...  What is the point of 17\" rims and tires? I thought you would know this, since you seem pretty knowledgeable on cars, but larger rims and narrower profile tires help improve handling. For example, someone (you?) noted when I mentioned a handling issue on the Accord LX with 16\" wheels and tires, that it would probably not be an issue with the 17\" wheels and tires. So they are not just for \"style.\" But the 17\" rims on the Mazda6 do look quite nice.Frankly, I could do w/o the underbody kit and rear spoiler on the Mazda6i VE, but they\\'re there, so I\\'d take them.  A BMW 328i handles better in stock form with its P205/55/R16 rims than any of the midsize cars being mentioned here. In fact, that also happens to be the stock tire size for Civic (LX/EX), and lower profile than Mazda6i Sport which wears P205/60/R16.Handling is largely a function of tires and chassis set up, and you can see this today between Acura TL and Acura TL Type-S. They both wear identically sized P235/45/R17 rubber. OTOH, Accord Coupe now gets P235/45/R18, but I will be surprised if it can out-handle TL-S.A down side to larger rims is added weight (assuming similar manufacturing process). In fact, going from P215/50/R17 (17x7) wheels in 2007 Accord to P225/50/R17 (17x7.5) wheels, about 30 lb of unsprung weight got added to 2008 Accord (some of that compromise may be to increase the profile a bit to improve ride quality with a little more rubber, about 0.2\" worth).In fact, it might also explain relatively large weight difference between Accord LX-P and Accord EX, which is 119 lb. I would guess about half it is due to larger 17\" alloys on the EX compared to 16\" alloys on LX-P because it is hard for me to fathom more than 60 lb or so added from additional features.IMO, power and handling benefits show exponential improvement (or degradation). At some point, any additional \"improvement\" becomes meaningless. Unfortunately, that point doesn\\'t garner much attention. People, and magazines are always thrilled to have/print bigger numbers. Whether they can put it to use, or not, is a whole another issue.Interestingly enough, when NSX first arrived, it had P205/50/R15 (front) and P225/50/R16 rims. Even as it departed, the rim size never grew past 17\".  Handling is largely a function of tires and chassis set up,...I agree. But I am not clear what your point is. Are you saying, for example, that if two cars have identical chassis, but one has 16\" high-profile tires and one has 17\" lower-profile tires, there won\\'t be much if any difference in handling between the two cars? Therefore I can just buy an Accord LX and get the same handling I\\'d get in a $30,000 EX V6?  Therefore I can just buy an Accord LX and get the same handling I\\'d get in a $30,000 EX V6? The advantage of the lower profile tires would probably be offset by the added weight of the EX V6. Of course the EX V6 would probably have thicker sway bars, different struts, and some other changes that could also make a difference.  Therefore I can just buy an Accord LX and get the same handling I\\'d get in a $30,000 EX V6?Tire/rim choices aside, being lighter and slightly better \"weight balanced\", Accord LX is actually better start for good handling. But there are differences in chassis tuning between LX and EXV6 (or EX or or EX-L or EXLV6). The higher trims use thicker rear stabilizer bars and have front shock tower bar that LX/LX-P don\\'t. So, there are more more differences than just tire/rim choices. For that matter, Honda generally tunes Coupe more aggressively than Sedan.As my comparison between TL and TL Type-S proves, there isn\\'t a need for larger rim to improve handling. Both TL and TL Type-S have identical tire/rim size. It is the rest of the chassis tuning that makes the difference.  As further explanation to curves and lines: I\\'ve read that much Japanese design was historically centered on up close detail. Maybe because the country was crowded and beauty was examined up close. Although the last German car I owned was a 71 Beetle, I think you could say that historically German cars were all about comprehensive styling, the overall layout. IMHO the best of the lot were the late nineties (or so) BMW\\'s which were beautifully understated. I can\\'t understand the new BMW complexity, Audi gaping grills, etc. Calling the new Accord Germanic is interesting. I don\\'t see it, but then again, I didn\\'t look closely at it with that in mind.  OK, that\\'s good to know. From now on, I\\'ll put the smallest possible tires on my cars, knowing that larger tires won\\'t improve handling. Thanks, you just saved me some money!   From now on, I\\'ll put the smallest possible tires on my cars, There\\'s a lot more to it than that. The overall diameter of the tire, the profile of the tire, the width of the tire (and wheel) all contribute to handling, and ride quality.  Are you sure? robertsmx seemed pretty confident that if you put a larger wheel and tire on a car, everything else being equal, handling isn\\'t improved and in fact could suffer (heavier wheels etc.). So for example, I didn\\'t lose anything getting a MPV LX with base 15\" rubber rather than the upmarket 16\" or 17\" wheels/tires. Apparently.  I think you already know the answer,  so I\\'m not going to explain it to you.  Frankly, I could do w/o the underbody kit and rear spoiler on the Mazda6i VE, but they\\'re there, so I\\'d take them. I am an anti-wingite, also. Spoiler is not standard on the Sedan VE, only the hatch. My VE Sedan is wingless  . I thought the same about the \"underbody kit\" (which is just side sill extensions). I initially thought I\\'d just as soon not have that, too. But after seeing the car without, I decided I much prefered the looks with it. Of course, even better would be to have the sheet metal shaped to eliminate the \"need\" for the add-on sill extensions. Just the better looks (due to alloys, side sills, smoked headlights,dark tail lights, and sport grill) of the VE made it well worth the $500 or so extra over the base version. Then getting the bonuses of 6 CD and power driver\\'s seat made me wonder how they sold any base models at all...I suppose they were mostly sold as loss-leaders.And, yes, the 17 inch alloys look very nice...much better than the standard steel wheels with fake alloy-look wheel covers. 16 inch alloys would have been fine with me, though. I can even live with steel wheels, but just hate the fake alloy wheel covers...wheel covers should just cover the wheel, like these do:   if you put a larger wheel and tire on a car, everything else being equal, handling isn\\'t improved and in fact could suffer (heavier wheels etc.). That is all relative to what tire and what kind of rim. It has been proven that a larger wheel and lower profile tire can improve handling, as long as the tire diameter does not change. With a lower profile tire, there is less yaw in lateral motion = better grip.  Could someone explain to me (an old fart) why anyone needs \"handling\" for a car that will be driven on city streets and straight American highways?  Could someone explain to me (an old fart) why anyone needs \"handling\" for a car that will be driven on city streets and straight American highways? \"Needs\", perhaps not...one could maybe argue for some small marginal safety improvement due to greater ability to avoid crashes, all else being equal. I want good handling for everything from changing lanes to going around corners and curves, just because I find it more pleasnt to drive such cars. For the many people, who don\\'t care about these things and would rather float down the highway in a vague handling car...well, I guess the Camry works for many of them. Many GM products also seem to be known for soft rides and vague steering.  Could someone explain to me (an old fart) why anyone needs \"handling\" for a car that will be driven on city streets and straight American highways?The same reason someone needs 280hp in a family car. Also, not every city street is a straight line, nor is every American highway straight and flat. If you live in Kansas, I could see your point but in California (and even in the midwest) there are hills, valleys, mountains (well, not in the midwest so much) and curves.It is also easier to avoid a collision in a vehicle that can corner and provide feedback to the driver.If you are going to spend $20k on a car, can\\'t it be fun too?  If we ignore the fun factor and go for \"needs\" I\\'ll explain how I felt the need for it in two words:Accident Avoidance.A crisp handling car can maneuver away from trouble easier than a flabby-handling car can, maybe even avoiding causing a wreck yourself when you swerve/maneuver away from trouble.  Could someone explain to me (an old fart) why anyone needs \"handling\" for a car that will be driven on city streets and straight American highways? Well, not all city streets and American highways are straight. I live in New England, and no highways are straight, and everyone drives quite fast. When I go into NYC, I get passed when I\\'m driving 80, and some very narrow highways. Accident avoidance is a big thing, too.I would say in my neck of the woods, I find it a necessity.  Could someone explain to me (an old fart) why anyone needs \"handling\" for a car that will be driven on city streets and straight American highways? Wants and needs are totally separate emotions. Not sure how much time you spend in your ride, but considering I spend more time in mine than my living room, I want the upper end of amenities in my car.You don\\'t really need cushions on your couch, do you?  Could someone explain to me (an old fart) why anyone needs \"handling\" for a car that will be driven on city streets and straight American highways?I\\'m with you. The \"handling\" aspect of a mid-size sedan is a greatly overstated positive aspect that has very little practical application in everyday driving.  while it is generally true that more rubber on the road = better handling and braking it is almost too easy to screw things up by upsizing your tires/wheels - because the weight or inertial (diameter) increases can and will hurt braking (especially), ride (most of the time). Whenever I see one of those coke can exhaust \\'rice rockets\\' on the road with those 18 or 20\" wheels and some 30 or 35% tires, I can\\'t help but think of all the damage that owner has actually done to his car (even to the point of making the car unsafe). The point being that if you want to improve the dynamic character of yor car, do it with better tires - not by monkeying around with your tire/wheel sizes too much.  Interesting that you bought one of the best handling cars in the class then, if you feel that way! A softer ride may suit you better!  One aspect of handling that I think is taken for granted too often is good brakes. On more than one occasion I\\'ve had to slam on my brakes b/c of some unsafe driving by other drivers... I\\'ve read in several tests done by car mags that my Mazda6 has some of the best brakes in this class, and in some instances, if I had been driving a different midsize sedan, I\\'d probably have had to deal with insurance issues and possibly some injured passengers. I know seatbelts and airbags save a lot of lives, but I also believe that avoiding an accident is my best bet and good brakes (which I think is an important compenent of handling) are critical.  but I also believe that avoiding an accident is my best bet and good brakes Brakes, suspension, and steering responsiveness all contribute to great accident avoidance. Mazda calls ABS, Able to Brake and Steer. The Mazda6 is one of the best at accident avoidance, and handling because of the total package of all three systems.  In the end, you&#146;re going to do what you want to, and that&#146;s fine. But don&#146;t go too far. Keep them big enough so you don\\'t lose the ability to lap those Indy cars with tiny rims. In fact, go 24\", Michael Schumacher will salute you, and you will be every Ferrari owners\\' envy. To me, just like everything else, there is a balance to be found, a sweet spot. Going overboard has never been my way. Give me 16\" alloys on my family sedan, and I\\'m okay, as long as the chassis is tuned right. Besides, I don\\'t mind being (at least) $150 richer every time I replace the tires.  Interesting that you bought one of the best handling cars in the class then, if you feel that way! A softer ride may suit you better!The superior handling characteristics of our 2007 SEL AWD Ford Fusion were an added bonus, to be sure, but, yes, I would prefer a bit softer ride. The 17- by 7.5-inch alloy wheels and 225/50/17R Michelin tires are a bit much in my book.  Handling is important, and so is power. But, there is a sweet spot that many manage to overlook in favor of the endless more. A good handling car is a good communicator. It will inform the driver of everything good, and bad. It will also respond to the driver&#146;s inputs and keep unpleasant surprises away.Ten years ago when I was shopping for my first new car, Passat and Accord were the finalists. Both offered things most others didn&#146;t, and that was good communication with good ride quality. The Passat did it slightly better than Accord, but I was wary of longevity with the VW and its turbo engine, premium fuel and fuel economy. So Accord was it. Power wasn\\'t the top priority, as both cars were rated at 150 HP, which was actually the lowest of the bunch I test drove.I had test driven the two a few times, and during one of the drives in an Accord, the sales person took the car to an empty two-lane back road with curves. The speed limit was 30 mph. He warned me to hold tight, accelerated to 40-45 mph and at a point right after a curve, braked hard while steering the car to the inside lane. He asked me to take note of everything the car did. I was impressed, and more so, after he had me try the same.Of course, I didn&#146;t buy my Accord from him since I didn&#146;t want a unit that was abused like that. :P (but there was actually another reason to it, a competing dealer offered better price). At that point I thought it was a good thing to have something I might never use, a car that stopped flat while affording excellent steering ability and ABS worked impressively.A few months later, I ended up in a situation that required a maneuver like that, and this was on a freeway, going around 65 mph in traffic (going far enough in history, you may find my post on Edmunds on this incident). One of several cars in front had hit something in the middle lane that sent a Jeep off the highway (and I was surprised it didn&#146;t flip over) and panic struck. I had little place to maneuver with cars all over. When we all stopped, there was a Volvo to my left, the (original culprit) Crown Victoria to the right in the middle lane and I was between them. Not even a scratch. The driver to my left and I looked at each other and smiled, and went about our business. I haven&#146;t had to use it again, but that only increased respect for the car I was driving.Besides handling as it is understood in the traditional way, there is another important aspect of it that is not talked about as much. And that is in how chassis settles after going over bumps at high speeds (or even low). If you take an Accord over a bump at high speed, the chassis will only bounce once. It will settle immediately after. Another car will bounce and re-bounce, and sometimes the wheel angle will unsettle that there is some loss in control (and worse, many of these cars isolate the driver so much that they may not know what is happening). You can actually observe this while following different cars and how they respond. The less the rebound, the more control the driver has.Yet another example would be from my experience from a few years ago at a slow exit ramp. I prefer not to slow down too much when getting off freeway to allow the rest of the traffic to continue instead of having to brake behind me. Depending on the ramp, I will brake a bit or let the car roll to a reasonable speed thru it. My rental Avalon was doing its job until the entry at which point it started to understeer. To correct, I applied the trick that works in my Accord, brake slightly and steer inwards. The Accord&#146;s rear suspension would rise to the occasion providing a gradual passive rear wheel steering to rotate the car and the steering provides enough feedback. But in the Avalon, the understeer changed to snap oversteer and I almost lost control. There was absolutely no feedback from the steering either (which was overboosted to begin with). The suspension wasn&#146;t firm on the ground but doing cha-cha.The interesting thing about all this is that nobody would confuse an (American) Accord for a sport sedan. But, its chassis tuning does those little things very well. It will understeer, but it will get out of a situation like that even with throttle applied, rotating the car. And another area where it excels would be cross winds.Take a Camry and an Accord on an open stretch with plenty of cross winds, and you just might see how much difference chassis can make. Backy doesn&#146;t like it, and has heard me say this a few times, but I have an unforgettable memory of being overtaken in a Sonata by a minivan while carving the canyons over a freeway in Oregon. This is another story that might still be around in Edmunds from my postings in 2002. Speed limit was 70, and I had the throttle all the way down. I felt like going 70-75 mph only to realize moments later that cars and minivans were overtaking me (I&#146;m not a slow driver). I looked at the speedometer and it was showing 65 mph. There were two problems. One, the engine didn&#146;t offer much (which was a disappointment since it was a 2.7/V6), but more importantly, the car felt faster than it was traveling and that goes down to the car&#146;s handling aspect.A good chassis can provide a hunkered down drivability with good maneuverability. I couldn&#146;t care less for more, because I also care for good ride quality. So, handling and strong chassis are always a good starting point, but not the end.  Backy doesn&#146;t like it, and has heard me say this a few times, but I have an unforgettable memory of being overtaken in a Sonata by a minivan while carving the canyons over a freeway in Oregon.Yes, I recall your talking before about this experience in a car that hasn\\'t been sold in the U.S. for 2-1/2 years and was designed in the mid-\\'90s. But I\\'m still not clear on its relevance to this discussion. :confuse: If you want, I could wax poetic about my experiences driving underpowered cars--including Toyotas and Hondas. But since that was years ago, I won\\'t bother you with them.  But that car is new enough to be still under warranty (in fact, just half of it).   If it was a rental car in 2002 (meaning it may have been older than MY 2002), it\\'s probably no longer under warranty. As if that matters at all.  The superior handling characteristics of our 2007 SEL AWD Ford FusionSuperior to what? There are cars in this class I\\'d call preferable to the others but none of them start with the letter F. Even then I wouldn\\'t use the term superior in describing their attributes.  There are cars in this class I\\'d call preferable to the others but none of them start with the letter F. Even then I wouldn\\'t use the term superior in describing their attributes. We all have our own opinions, however, the Ford Fusion does have far better handling to that of Camry, 2003-2007 Accord ann 2002-2007 Altima. I am not sure about the new Accord or Altima. Plus, the Fusion is offered in AWD. There have been numerous comparo\\'s done to prove this. C&D\\'s sticks out in my memory.While you may not like Ford as a whole, the Fusion is a huge step in the right direction. SO I ask, \"Have you driven a Ford lately??\"   SO I ask, \"Have you driven a Ford lately??\" If you haven\\'t looked at Ford lately, look again!  May be not THAT car, but unless rental cars are purposely built to different specs, any other 2002-2003 isn&#146;t going to be any different. And I\\'m guessing quite a few of them are still on the road as they are new enough to still have half of the original warranty (that Hyundai advertises in big letters). If it were a car from the late 90s, much less from early 90s, then I won\\'t be bringing it up.  What is the point of comparing a car from 2002, which was designed in the mid-\\'90s, to today\\'s standards? If you want to go down that route, we could for example compare, say, a 2002 Accord to a 2008 Altima, or even a Sonata. But to what purpose?Funny though how you bring up the Hyundai powertrain warranty now. I didn\\'t think you thought much of it.  \"Have you driven a Ford lately??\"Actually yes. And not just \"driven\" one - I bought one. A F150 for my business. On labor day weekend.Its a fine truck, but I wouldn\\'t call it superior to the competition, as the guy with the Fusion says of his vs. whatever he\\'s comparing it to.I test drove the Fusion - twice - in 4 cyl and 6 cyl form, and found it less desireable than the 06 Accord or Altima I also tested.I didn\\'t weave it thru a slalom but after driving for 30+ years, I think I have a good feel for \"superior\" handling in a vehicle.  If I couldn\\'t talk about a car from 2002-2003, talking about my 1998 Accord makes it worse, right? Interestingly enough, that Accord was about as old in 2002-2003 as the 2002-2003 would be today, and served as a fine benchmark (and still does today). In fact, it feels quite young. PS. The original intent was to illustrate the point of handling performance. When something feels faster than it is, then there is a problem.  the Ford Fusion does have far better handling to that of Camry, 2003-2007 Accord ann 2002-2007 Altima.Uh...I am currently driving a Fusion SE rental car right now for 2 weeks since an 80-year-old decided I have to sideline my car for a while. Anyway, the fusion\\'s handling is nothing to write home about. It is marginally better than my mom\\'s 1999 Camry but worse than the 2007 Camry SE I had on my last trip and much worse than my old 1997 Honda Accord.I am not trying to knock on the Fusion, which is a quantum leap compare to the old Taurus. However, comparing to the 10-year-old Honda Accord, asides for a few modern gadgets that it has the \\'97 Accord is a much better car IMO.I would also pick the Camry SE over the Fusion. For all those people knocking on how bad the Camry handles, go try the SE version and it\\'ll surprise you dearly.  the fusion\\'s handling is nothing to write home about. It is marginally better than my mom\\'s 1999 Camry but worse than the 2007 Camry SE I had on my last trip and much worse than my old 1997 Honda Accord. According to many authors, they feel the Fusion SEL AWD handles better. Like I said, C&D\\'s artice trally sticks out in my mind.I have driven a Fusion, and it does handle nicely. Last time I drove a Camry, MY 2002-2006, it felt like a grandma mobile. Very comfortable, but, not meant to hit the corners. I used to own a 1991 Accord, and it handled nicely as well, but, it was smaller then the current Civic! My father owns a 2004 Accord coupe, and it has nice power, but, I never really tried to hit any corners with it. The 2006 Accord LX sedan I have on my lot is really nothing to write home about. Very basic. Not great in the corners.  What if I don\\'t need AWD since where I live rarely (if not never) snows. Why do I need to get AWD for better handling since other FWD sedans in the same class offer better handling? Why can\\'t Ford puts better handling into the FWD Fusion if Honda can do it 10 years ago?Too many unanswered questions.Fusion is a decent effort from Ford but close, no cigar yet.Last time I drove a Camry, MY 2002-2006, it felt like a grandma mobile.Didn\\'t you read my post before replying? I did say that the Fusion handles better than my mom\\'s old Camry but the one I said that\\'s better is the 2007 Camry SE.  Handling is nice, but not most important. The suspension a car has, can make a big difference to me, in other ways. Some cars are not very stable at speed. They handle bumps very well, but will feel floaty or jittery, even when the road is smooth. In some cars, if you want to take a turn quickly, the front of the car feels like it dives, and the car leans a lot. I do appreciate a smooth ride, but not at the expense of everything else. I also can appreciate good handling, but not if the ride is harsh, and everything in the car vibrates and rattles. It\\'s a fine line, and my Accord rides it very well.  As Mickyrom knows, we\\'re both old farts with Optimas. I haven\\'t read all the responses but I\\'ll make a case for the joys of 60 series and handling mediocrity. I have the Michelin 50 series tires that came with the appearance group. The dealer was all out of 60 series tires and gave me an excellent deal. I think the handling is definitely better but the comfort certainly isn\\'t. I find my 05 Malibu Maxx with 60 series tires to be more comfortable. Plus, replacement costs will be a lot higher on the Optima. Then again, I\\'m not 25 years old and I\\'m not Car and Driver.  Although the US will likely only get the 2.5 liter and a new v-6 (3.5 or 3.7 liter...don\\'t know for sure yet), it seems pretty much everything has improved. I\\'m glad mazda hasn\\'t softened the Mazda6 too much while increasing the quality of the interior, the size of the interior and HP and reducing weight and road noise. Of course I\\'d still would like to know more about the US version, but this will have to do for now. My favorite quote:The biggest compliment we can pay the car is that it\\'s totally consistent. Whatever you do with the accelerator or steering won\\'t upset it.With taut body control, strong, progressive brakes, minimal tendency to run wide in hard cornering and even the ability to tuck tighter into bends if you ease off the throttle, it\\'s predictable, but enjoyable to drive.Japanese style with European dynamics? It works.2009 Mazda6 preview  I would also pick the Camry SE over the Fusion. For all those people knocking on how bad the Camry handles, go try the SE version and it\\'ll surprise you dearly.I have. A 2007, to be exact. Handling is good, and leagues better than the regular Camry.Better than the Fusion? Not really IMO. Both the Milan and Fusion have very good handling, and the SE feels about the same, with a slightly softer ride.Most impressive in terms of handling was the Altima and the Aura. The Altima has always handled well, but the \\'07-up is more refined. The Aura was a BIG surprise, taking corners with great confidence and a smooth ride.  Not to mention one has to pay an extra $1200, over the Camry LE price, to get the SE. Many other cars come with good handling standard on all trim levels.  PS. The original intent was to illustrate the point of handling performance. When something feels faster than it is, then there is a problem.Its more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow, given that it would be basically the same speed.  Didn\\'t you read my post before replying? I did say that the Fusion handles better than my mom\\'s old Camry but the one I said that\\'s better is the 2007 Camry SE. Yeeeees. I was adding my own .02 Am I allowed to do that?  Some cars are not very stable at speed. They handle bumps very well, but will feel floaty or jittery, even when the road is smooth. In some cars, if you want to take a turn quickly, the front of the car feels like it dives, and the car leans a lot.This was one of the reasons I went with the EX vs the VP, as the VP lacks the rear sway bar, which adds stability in crosswinds. It also has a slightly larger footprint as each tire is 10mm wider (of course the size and style of tire kind of neuters the car, but thats neither here nor there). My Accord has gone back once to have the suspension checked because I couldn\\'t believe the amount of body roll, I thought a sway bar end link had been damaged or not connected or something.In hindsight, I could\\'ve gotten the VP and added a suspension kit and aftermarket tires and wheels and still come out ahead, but bygones.  there is definitely a relationship between a \\'tightened\\' \\'go-kart\\' type suspension and the perception by the autobuyer that this in itself is indicative of \\'good\\' handling, which may or may not be true. One reason the Mazda6 doesn\\'t sell well is that it is simply too tight for the average US autobuyer, the ride/handling compromise that Honda has generally done a good job finding, and that Toyota has usually been on the \\'soft\\' side of. The Camry easily outsells the other cars in this group because this is what American drivers have shown to prefer - with their pocketbooks. Nissan has done the best job attacking the other end of the market as also evidenced by sales numbers, ever since inventing the term \\'4 door sports sedan\\'. So diss the \\'soft\\' characteristics of a Camry LE or XLE if you will - Toyota seems to know something about buyers of cars in this class that we don\\'t. A soft boulevard ride sells better (at least in this country) than perceived (or even real) handling qualities. It simply matters more to the guys who count, the autobuyers.  What exactly is your point? That Camry is the biggest selling car in the US? That a soft boulevard ride sells better than good handling qualities in the US? I think we already knew both those things. :P  One reason the Mazda6 doesn\\'t sell well is that it is simply too tight for the average US autobuyer, and thankfully, they support the market that is looking for that type of vehicle.Nissan has done the best job attacking the other end of the market as also evidenced by sales numbers, ever since inventing the term \\'4 door sports sedan\\'.

Also, the Camry has an average buyer of 55 years old. I think that age group also prefers a \"soft boulevard\" ride to a tighter, sportier ride.The 30 yr old Mazda6 buyer seems to want the sportier, tighter ride.I do not see the Camry getting knocked off it\\'s high horse anytime soon. If it is, it will be by the 2008 Accord IMO.  there is definitely a relationship between a \\'tightened\\' \\'go-kart\\' type suspension and the perception by the autobuyer that this in itself is indicative of \\'good\\' handling, which may or may not be true.

Nissan has done the best job attacking the other end of the market as also evidenced by sales numbers, ever since inventing the term \\'4 door sports sedan\\'.For handling like a go-kart, you\\'d need to go to another class of car altogether... nothing in this segment is even close to that. Remember these are midsize sedans not sports cars. Some are sportier than others for certain, but all cars in this segment need to find that balance between comfort and handling. As to the difference between Mazda and other makes, I found on my test drives that the Mazda6 and Altima (previous generation) were very similar in how smooth they drove with the Altima less able to handle big bumps without feeling as though the suspension ran out of travel. Going into corners, though, the mazda6 felt much more composed with better steering feel giving me a lot more confidence. Really, in terms of ride comfort, I thought the Altima, Accord (both previous generations) and Mazda6 were on par with each other. Some people have said they thought the Accord was a bit on the harsh side, but I think that exagerates the difference between the Accord and say the previous generation Camry way too much. Having road feel does not always mean harsh. Take a look at BMW, Audi, Mercedes, Infinity, Acura, Mazda, even Cadilac sales and I think you\\'ll see that there are many buyers in the US that value a \"connected\" driving experience over vague feel and a valium like driving experience.  Not to mention one has to pay an extra $1200, over the Camry LE price, to get the SE.As the Captain has pointed out, Camry\\'s core buyers are those who want a soft, comfortable boulevard cruiser that\\'ll probably never corner faster than 20 mph. The Camry LE and XLE did all those to the perfection and since that group of buyers seem to be the majority thus Camry\\'s sales title.However, for those who want a little bit more fun but still a Camry (maybe it\\'s due to the look, powertrain, quality perception or whatever) they have an alternative in the Camry SE. I wouldn\\'t knock on Camry for not offering stiffer suspension on all models since they have a core buyer group to think of. As matter of fact I would give credit to Toyota by offering the SE version so people on both side of the fence can be pleased.  2008 Honda Accord Maintenance and Repair ForumI created a new discussion!  I do not see the Camry getting knocked off it\\'s high horse anytime soon.The number of disgruntled Toyota owners is rising quickly thanks to the engine sludge and transmission problems in the Camry and the myriad of recent Toyota Tundra problems. Since most people buy Toyotas based on the perception that they are bulletproof I think those problems will have the biggest potential affect on future Toyota sales in general and specifically for the Camry (and Tundra).  Yup, that\\'ll be a big problem if Toyota decided to treat it like the way GM did back in the 80s and 90s. Toyota will turn into GM very quickly if that happens. However, I don\\'t think Toyota will become GM ever so I am sure the quality issues should be resolved fairly quickly. Toyota is going through growing pain and perception takes time to crumble.  I wouldn\\'t knock on Camry for not offering stiffer suspension on all models...I wasn\\'t...I only made the point that those who want better handling can get it in several other cars, without having to pay extra.  Let us take JD Powers word on overall dependability, in that it represents a typical buyer and a real scenario. This is how some of the midsize sedans stacked up:Honda Accord: 4/5Nissan Altima: 3/5Toyota Camry: 3/5Ford Fusion: 3/5Hyundai Sonata: 3/5Saturn Aura: 2/5Mazda6: 2/5VW Passat: 2/5The only car that is said to be better than Camry is the Accord. But, Accord isn&#146;t something that every Toyota buyer will find appealing. It rides firm and doesn&#146;t isolate folks as much as a typical Toyota buyer would fall for. They are certainly not going for Mazda6 or Passat or Aura for quality reasons.That said, quality issues and overall perception of the car itself are big deal to companies like Honda and Toyota. If Camry is not as good as it has traditionally been (these cars, BTW, have never been flawless, quality issues come and go, consumers stay), the bet should be on Toyota taking it seriously. These companies thrive on reputation and for good reason.Just look at what Honda did to Civic with the redesign. 2001-2005 Civic was immensely successful in terms of sales, perhaps the best years in Civic&#146;s sales history. But, Honda knew the car needed more than just sales. 2006 Civic hasn&#146;t really thrashed sales of the old (it has exceeded but not so much to make a big deal out of it), but the perception around the car has changed immensely, compared to previous generation.OTOH, look at Ford&#146;s take on Focus. A few days ago I spotted the latest model, but it took me a few minutes to figure out what it was. It gave me an impression of a car that may be sold in Mexico, but not here (I see quite a few cars driven from Mexico here in Dallas area, that aren&#146;t sold here). It is another lost opportunity. It doesn&#146;t stand out. It feels like a car that Ford (again) designed to be a rental queen. What is different about it from very first years of Focus which I thought was going to give Civic and Corolla a run for their money.Also worth noting is that a typical buyer is going to care less about issues that arise as a result of model change or anything that comes during the warranty period (first 3-5 years). It becomes an issue after the honeymoon is over.For example, based on the design, the approach and sales projections, for the new Accord, Honda seems to be targeting 1998-2002 Accord buyer base first. These are more likely to buy a new Accord than the folks that have 2003-2007. Now, these folks would return (I would) based on their experience with their Accords over last 4-5 years when their car was completely out of warranty, and how it held up to their abuse (or lack of).Thinking &#147;now&#148; may work &#147;now&#148;, but to be successful in the longer term, there needs to be a plan and proper execution that sticks to a formula.  (The best) Midsize Car JD Power 2007 Vehicle Dependability Studydrum roll pleaseBuick Centuryquote robertsmx-The only car that is said to be better than Camry is the Accord-endEven better than the Accord as rated by JD Power is the Buick Century.What is Buicks midsize car now? The LaCrosse? Without looking this up I could not think what the midsize currently sold by Buick was. :surprise: GM desperately needs to provide new product to Buick.  You left out a few:Buick Century 5/5Buick Regal 5/5Mercury Sable 5/5Fusion is missing from this list and Camry gets 4 dots, not 3:http://www.jdpower.com/autos/ratings/dependability/midsize-carAs for the Focus (when did that become midsize :confuse: ) it was the top rated car by CR when it first came out (Sept 2000 issue). However, this apparently did not translate into buyers being willing to pay a premium price for one (as they do for the civic). I think it is a good buy, even with it\\'s aging platform. Price-wise the Focus is more comparable to the Fit, just as cars like the Fusion are generally more comparable to the Civic in terms of actual selling prices.  Those are 2004 models. The Fusion and Milan won\\'t appear on that survey for 2 more years (2009 survey covering 2006 models).  All I said was that Toyota\\'s recent quality problems and especially the declaration from CR that it won\\'t automatically recommend new models and the fact that it dropped the V6 Camry and 4x4 Tundra from it\\'s recommended list, combined with plenty of dissatisfied owners can potentially knock Camry from the top spot.Toyota has lost it\\'s bulletproof image. We\\'ll have to wait and see what affect it has on sales down the road.  I think people, from my interaction with them everyday at work, that many Honda/Toyota/Nissan/Mazda buyers look at CR for reliability and quality before they look at JD Powers. From talking to a lot of people in the auto industry, connected to many different mfgr\\'s, JD Powers is not really regarded as a great source for anything. They are more like a Car and Driver or Motor Trend.What does \"overall quality\" really mean when CR or JD Powers places a \"quality\" label on vehicles they asses. Does it encompass the grade of materials? How they are put together? How long the car is going to last? Maybe a bit of all? Hmmm... I have personally noticed that the interior quality of materials in a Toyota Camry are low rent. Now, they are put together well. So, how does that score? Overall reliability seems to have seriously slipped as well. How does the Camry receive a 3 out of 5?The previous generation Honda Accord also utilized numerous plastic components, as does most every mfgr, but, I noticed more plastic then some other brands (Hyundai/Mazda). Once again, these materials are put together very well. So, once again, is the build quality regarded higher then the actual materials used? The ride/comfort of the Honda Accord was nothing special either. Reliability has been top knotch for the most part, apart from the V6 tranny\\'s.I have the most experience in a Mazda6 (2005 Mazda6 i 5-Door w/leather/Bose/moon roof). There are once again, plastics used in the interior, but, not as much as the current Camry or 2003-2007 Accord. The build quality is not as tight, but, so so close to Accord/Camry. The ride has not changed since day 1, and I have had no issues to date (4 cyl Mazda6\\'s have been rated well in reliability). What makes the Mazda6 score only 2 out of 5? Is is the sup par V6? How does the same V6 get rated high in the Fusion? It\\'s the same engine! I have no idea. Dose the fact that many Mazda6\\'s are fleet account for a low score. Fleet cars usually get the snot beat out of them. Once again, I have visited JD Powers web site and really do not understand their rating philosophy. I guess this is why I find them useless.  Funny how the Century, Regal, and Sable got left out of the earlier listing by robertsmx: GM and Ford.  Remember that their information comes from random surveys of owners over three years.JDPowers:Overall Dependability: Taken from the Vehicle Dependability Study (VDS), which looks at owner-reported problems in the first 3 years of new-vehicle ownership, this score is based on problems that have caused a complete breakdown or malfunction of any component, feature, or item (i.e., components that stop working or trim pieces that break or come loose). Powertrain Dependability: Taken from the Vehicle Dependability Study (VDS), which looks at owner-reported problems in the first 3 years of new-vehicle ownership, this score is based on problems with the engine or transmission as well as problems that affect the driving experience (i.e., vehicle/brakes pull, abnormal noises or vibrations) only. Body & Interior Dependability: Taken from the Vehicle Dependability Study (VDS), which looks at owner-reported problems in the first 3 years of new-vehicle ownership, this score is based on problems with wind noise, water leaks, poor interior fit/finish, paint imperfection, and squeaks/rattles.Features & Accessories Dependability: Taken from the Vehicle Dependability Study (VDS), which looks at owner-reported problems in the first 3 years of new-vehicle ownership, this score is based on problems with the seats, windshield wipers, navigation system, rear-seat entertainment system, heater, air conditioner, stereo system, sunroof and trip computer.  I stand corrected. Some of the links to dependability won\\'t respond so I clicked on \"rankings by segment\" and selected midsize, but didn\\'t realize it was talking IQS.Speaking of Buick, I think it benefits from the segment it caters to. I would also be interested to see average age of the buyers taking the surveys as well as miles driven to draw proper conclusions from any of these surveys. I have known folks who drive 5K miles or less/year. I drive that distance in two months.  Yeah, while \"defending\" a car that I can\\'t see myself buying.  I mentioned Focus after Civic, and neither was to talk about size but to discuss approach automakers take. Obviously, you missed the point completely.But in the process, you did mention something that relates to the topic. I have seen several people complain about Camry being favored by CR as they recommend even the new model by default. That doesn&#146;t seem to be an issue with Focus being recommended when it first came out. So I say, let recommendation be what it is. CR has as much a crystal ball as did Ms Cleo.We could discuss pricing elsewhere, but since you brought it up, Focus is really priced above Fit and comparable to Civic. Equip base with ABS, automatic transmission, and you&#146;re into $16.5K mark (Fit is about $2K cheaper). But market isn&#146;t willing to pay the price for it, and incentives/rebates are almost warranted. Could have been better, if Ford actually took care of its business properly when it was launched (which was quite a splash, actually). If they didn&#146;t learn from it, Fusion&#146;s future won&#146;t be any different. As of now, it does look promising.  While I quoted JD power and do look at CR ratings, I only take them for what they are. New buyers may not buy into Camry\\'s reputation based on that, but for repeat buyers (or buyers with history based on experiencence from friends and family) those numbers don\\'t tell the story.I started with a used 1982 Supra-Celica. It held up well, virtually guaranteeing my next purchased to be a Toyota. I bought used 1988 Corolla GT-S coupe. It held up extremely well, sold at 138K miles and was still running around 168K miles with the guy who bought from me. And it was not only reliable, it was also a fun car to drive and a lot more stable at speed than the sedan.This led to yet another used Toyota, 1992 Camry which I had until I decided to go Honda. Major reason for my switch was my driving experience, not ownership experience. The ownership experience led to me picking a Honda over VW (Passat), however. From one brand with reputation to another. Since then, I\\'ve been a Honda guy, not just based on reputation of the company but based in experience.This is how companies begin to garner respect, build a customer base, and repeat buyers. My cars over last ten years:1998 Accord (current, 183K miles)1999 Prelude (sold for Civic)2000 Civic (replaced by TL)2006 TL (current, 30K miles)Under consideration (to replace the Accord if there is a need):2008/2009 Accord2009 FitIt doesn\\'t matter what JD Power or CR put on the survey. Those are simply fun numbers for me to look at. I don\\'t put greater value on them over my ownership experience.  It doesn\\'t matter what JD Power or CR put on the survey. Those are simply fun numbers for me to look at. I don\\'t put greater value on them over my ownership experienceThat is the way I think of it too.  JD Power ratings are such a weak way to assess a car. What is a better source of reliability information than JD Power?Consumer Reports only survey\\'s subscribers and is certainly not preferred to JD Power.  \"What is a better source of reliability information than JD Power?\"While I\\'m sure the JD Power bible is the final purchase arbiter of a car decision for posters in the glass house, I\\'ve actually to meet anybody in real life who consulted with JD Power before buying a vehicle. What people do in this glass house vs the real world are two different things.  Consumer Reports only survey\\'s subscribers and is certainly not preferred to JD Power. I have found long term reliability ratings from CR to be more accurate. JD only goes three years out, and are a random surveys. I have never received a JD survey.  CR or JD Powers\\' usability goes only as far as TV commercials, and hold as much value as NHTSA\\'s safety star rating (which don\\'t hold much meaning until one actually digs deeper into the claims).For that matter, if you look at dependability survey, Mercury Sable has 5/5 overall dependability rating but its virtual twin has only 3/5. Why does this happen? You can see something similar in compact car segment too. Cavalier and Sunfire were virtual twins, yet the Chevrolet is deemed more dependable.  My problem with vague symbols like stars or colored circles is that it overstates what are really pretty close values. When JD Power released long term reliability data, the # of probs over a multi year period for the best rated vehicles was around 3 and around 4 for the below average vehicles. Consumer reports showed similar data as well... the difference between their top rating and below average rating was often just a few percent over a five year period. I would suggest that it\\'s in consumer reports and JD powers interest to make the differences seem more than what they really are so that the data is more dramatic which would compell more people to look at their conclusions thus buying more of their product/subscriptions.  They just admitted that they have been letting Camry skate based on past experience. They think now that the Camry no longer rates an automatic pass.Which I interpret to mean that up until recently they have been giving high ratings to a model that they now admit does not deserve it. Which means they have misled their leadership for the past few years.What they need to do now is fess up and say which other models they are predicting high, or for that matter, low, ratings based on past glory, but have no empirical evidence either way.It\\'s nice that CR admits its error in misleading its subscribers; it\\'s funnier that people still accept CR as gospel.  I\\'ve been price shopping the new Taurus for my grandmother... Out the door prices come to $22k. I dare ya to find that on a V6 Accord or Camry right now! Just something to keep in mind; there are other value leaders besides Hyundai.  Yes, I saw a new Lucerne advertised for $21k the other day, and Azera SEs can be had for that also. Fusion V6s start at around $20k (discounted), and of course there\\'s the Optima. Several good choices for value in this class if the Camcordma is too pricey and something else meets your needs.  >It\\'s nice that CR admits its error in misleading its subscribers; CR should have admitted its bias much earlier. >it\\'s funnier that people still accept CR as gospelAnd they did just that and some always will. There\\'s even a topic here about CR.  I agree. There may (or may not) be big difference between a 4-star versus 5, or above average versus good. In fact, in some cases (as I pointed out about NHTSA\\'s star rating system, a few days ago) that it could be the opposite. But I would pay closer attention to difference between 3-star and 5-star (or colors, if they apply).  One could choose to ignore predicted reliability and simply look for reliability from the past. In case of Camry, the prediction is based on the car\\'s and the company\\'s past. I don\\'t see an issue with it. Predicted reliability will always be... prediction, not a guarantee. See what happened with Focus. It had a high predicted reliability when it first arrived, right? So, it is not something that Toyota gets.One could argue that predicted reliability should be simply taken off the print. What is the point anyway? In fact, why even bother with reliability of \"new\" cars? It only makes sense in used car market, because for new cars, even based on same design, prediction is just that, looking at the crystal ball with the past behind it. It doesn\\'t guarantee replication or improvement.  That\\'s the key; her needs are obviously very different than mine (I enjoy the driving process, being 20 I don\\'t go in search of the quietest smoothest ride). I also don\\'t have a predetermined good repoire with Ford vehicles like she does (she likes Fords as a whole).My grandmother drove Ford most of her life (starting with a Fairlane, had a Torino, Granada, and an \\'84 LTD (the Fairmont-based one). After that, she bought a \\'91 Civic which she loved, and replaced it with a \\'96 Accord (now my car), and followed that one up with her current 2002 Accord). Now that Honda is getting expensive yet cheaper with the Accord, I\\'m trying to guide her back to Ford. Her last two Accords have been LX 4-cyl Auto models. She doesn\\'t care for frills; she won\\'t learn how to use them! An LX 4-cylinder Accord is now the same price as a Taurus, which supposedly a better riding car, with 80+ more power, and a much smoother ride. She\\'s not a driving enthusiast (she\\'s 72) so the whole Honda \"handling\" premise doesn\\'t matter to her.  She\\'s not a driving enthusiast (she\\'s 72) so the whole Honda \"handling\" premise doesn\\'t matter to her.She might find a smaller car easier to maneuver and/or see. My grandma went from the biggest Pontiac I\\'d ever seen to a Camry in the 80s and my other grandma went from a huge Buick to an early 90s Century. Even my grandpa went from a RWD Impala to a FWD Bonneville.  I agree with that too. The only thing is it is easier for her to get in a car that\\'s higher up. My aunt (who has an Odyssey and is pining for a CR-V - she thinks they are \"the cutest thing!\")wants her to test a CR-V. That may be a good idea.  I\\'ve been price shopping the new Taurus for my grandmotherIs she looking for FWD or AWD? I will say, you do get a lot of car for the money in the Taurus/Sable  \"She\\'s not a driving enthusiast (she\\'s 72) so the whole Honda \"handling\" premise doesn\\'t matter to her.\"Riding around in retirement communities one can\\'t help but notice the number of Accords and Camrys. One has to wonder why?  Well, if its anything like my grandmother\\'s case, she keeps buying what she\\'s always had because they\\'ve been nothing but good. She told me \"they\\'ve never given me a reason to go anywhere else\" talking about buying cars at the Honda dealer that is literally walking distance from her house. Her first Honda was bought when she was in her early 50s.  Is she looking for FWD or AWD? FWD. We haven\\'t had measurable snow in Birmingham in 7 years (although that IS a record!). All her cars for the last 20+ years have been FWD  I guess tonight could be our Crew World Series party since last night\\'s game makes me think there\\'s a slim chance the Series might not last until next Thursday! :P The Subaru Crew Chat is on tonight.

The Civic is now nearly the same size as the Accord used to be.How large is large enough for a midsize car? Is the current Accord and similar size cars too small, too large, or just right?  See what happened with Focus. It had a high predicted reliability when it first arrived, right? Predicted by whom? Not by CR. They would never have predicted high reliability for a brand-new model from Ford, back when the Focus debuted, or now. But with Ford improving, maybe they\\'ll get the \"magic pass\" sometime in the future.A prediction is only good if things remain fairly constant. With Toyota\\'s reliability falling off (several indications of this besides the trouble with the V6 Camry), and given they have been a leader in reliability for many years, it\\'s just not a good idea for anyone to predict high reliability for a brand-new design from any car maker these days.  I agree with that too. The only thing is it is easier for her to get in a car that\\'s higher up. My aunt (who has an Odyssey and is pining for a CR-V - she thinks they are \"the cutest thing!\")wants her to test a CR-V. That may be a good idea.The CR-V might be a lot higher up. I definitely remember having to step up to get in. You might also look at the Suabrus. The Outback models have slightly different suspensions and silly tires and wheels that make them a little higher to help egress. I think my mom is leaning towards one of those.  Predicted by whom? Not by CR. They would never have predicted high reliability for a brand-new model from Ford, back when the Focus debuted, or now.Go back a few posts and you will see someone posting Focus being rated high initially by CR (in 2000). Those aren\\'t my words, and since I don\\'t have subscription to CR, can\\'t validate that either.That said, do other cars get predicted reliability ratings from CR? Or, was it limited only to Camry?  1985 Accord was a subcompact to barely a compact, not a midsize. Do you think that size would sell today in a family sedan? How about the engine?  Focus as a car was and still is rated highly by CR. But not in terms of reliability. Predicted reliability is a separate assessment from how they rank a car vs. others.You can find CR at your local library and see how it rates cars and reports on predicted reliability (no, it\\'s not just on the Camry)--no subscription to CR is needed.  1985 Accord was a subcompact to barely a compact, not a midsize. Do you think that size would sell today in a family sedan? Using the Civic which is now 1985 Accord sized as an example then yes they sell, and yes they are used by families. What size do you believe is required for \"family\" use? For the purpose of this discussion, using a family of four as a standard.Midsize car such as Malibu or Camry? Are they too small for four North Americans? :surprise:  If Accord were to sell in Civic volume, Civic would be selling in Fit volume, and Honda would be owned by another company. Thats the reality. Here is more.Fit is somewhere between the first Accord (about half foot shorter) and first generation Civic (about half foot longer). Civic is about the size of an Accord from 25 years ago. If you think these two sizes are sufficient for American family sedan duties, then you need to look around. Accord outsells Civic and Fit combined. Is there an automaker that you know would gladly dismiss one of its midsizers and make a living by selling subcompact to compact cars for family vehicle duties?IMO, a car with good room for four, and decent cargo room makes for a good family car. It doesn\\'t need to be as big as Taurus. And it cannot be Civic-sized either. Cars like Mazda6 are borderline acceptable. Take an average, and you just might find solid offerings from all automakers.  Is there any other car that has (or has had) a high \"predicted\" reliability from CR besides the Camry?  As a family sedan, Accord is okay at where it is - borderline between midsize and large sedan. However, it shouldn\\'t keep growing with every iteration IMO, where is it going to stop? Civic can go up to the lower end of the midsize category since Honda now has Fit to take care of the small car market.The only way to stop this trend is for us American to stop getting fatter and fatter. :surprise:  Is there any other car that has (or has had) a high \"predicted\" reliability from CR besides the Camry?It sounded like all new Toyota models were given the benefit of the doubt in the past, not just the Camry. I would assume Honda gets the same treatment but can\\'t confirm that.  Looking at the Odyssey minivan\\'s reliability (typically reported as average), I\\'d assume otherwise. Just my opinion; I could be wrong.  I would assume Honda gets the same treatment but can\\'t confirm that. Honda does for the most part. They recommend almost every new vehicle they put out. When the RDX came out, it was recommended ASAP.  Looking at the Odyssey minivan\\'s reliability (typically reported as averageMaybe because the 2nd gen Odyssey\\'s were totally inconsistent, and had the faulty transmission bug. I don\\'t know if the 3rd gen\\'s have been much better. However, an Odyssey is still better then most van\\'s.  Is there any other car that has (or has had) a high \"predicted\" reliability from CR besides the Camry?Yes, several. The easiest way to see this is look at the April \"auto issue\" (at your local library), and there\\'s a bunch of tables that show both CR\\'s reliability \"verdicts\" of the car as a used car, and their predicted reliability for the car as new. Looks like CR is going to publish an update in their next issue, based on results of their latest survey. This is the survey in which the Camry V6 took a hit. I posted the best and worst family cars from that update a few days ago.  What I would like to know is which (new) cars get high marks on predicted reliability that is not a Toyota (or Honda, if you prefer). Aren\\'t there any? Haven\\'t there been any?  As I just said, I posted this info a few days ago (6464). For your convenience, here\\'s a copy/paste from that post:Most Reliable-listed in ratings order, starting with the best score Toyota Prius Honda Accord (2007) Hyundai Sonata (4-cyl.) Toyota Camry Hybrid* Ford Fusion Mercury Milan (* means rating is based on one model year)These are the family cars (CR\\'s classification) that are the highest scoring in reliability, based on CR\\'s latest survey. All but the Accord are the same designs for 2008 as for 2007. I think CR gave the Accord a high predicted reliability rating for 2008, even though it\\'s a new design. We\\'ll see if that comes back to haunt them, like when they said the 2007 Camry would have high reliability, and the V6 models didn\\'t measure up to that prediction based on the survey results.  You know Hyundai targets value with Sonata. I think it is getting redesigned next year(?). If I were to ask you, would you say (predict) that it will continue to target value? What criteria did you use?Next question. When Hyundai launches Genesis, do you expect it to target value?Back to reliability. Assume that 2008 Sonata does well in reliability score. If CR puts predicted reliability on 2009 Sonata as recommended, it will not be something unexpected to me. But, I must ask, would you then say that they are showing bias for Hyundai by putting recommendation on a new model?  I think Hyundai will increasingly highlight the quality and reliability of its vehicles such as the Sonata (note it\\'s now the #2 mid-sized sedan per CR in reliability, behind only the previous-gen Accord), while it continues to emphasize value compared to brands like Toyota and Honda. You asked for my prediction, my opinion, and that\\'s it. Why? Simply, why not use all the weapons at your disposal in a war, instead of just one?Genesis isn\\'t a mid-sized family car.Since the 2009 Sonata will be a refresh (e.g. new front fascia, new dash, tweaks of existing engines) and not a redesign, I can see that a reliability recommendation for 2008 would carry over to 2009. But when the Sonata is redesigned (2011 or 2012 MY?), then I would hope CR would wait to see how the new design holds up--just as it should have waited on the redesigned Camry, and the redesigned Accord.  Since you conveniently avoided answering my questions directly, I should be able to extrapolate your responses based on your post. Let us see:The question was: &#147;If I were to ask you, would you say (predict) that it will continue to target value?&#148;The answer seems to be a big yes. The long first sentence in the first paragraph highlights this. The short ones that follow are all about utter avoidance so I will leave it at that, for now.The complementary question was: &#147;What criteria did you use?&#148;Your response highlights an opinion, based on the past. So, you predicted something in the future based on a trend from the past. Did I get that right?The next question: &#147;When Hyundai launches Genesis, do you expect it to target value?&#148;Your response to this is another example of avoidance. You didn&#146;t have an issue talking about Focus in an earlier post in this thread, why has size become an issue now? I&#146;m taking another big &#147;yes&#148; for your answer, which will be along the lines of your response to the first, again, based on the past. If you disagree, let me know.The question: &#147;If CR puts predicted reliability on 2009 Sonata as recommended, it will not be something unexpected to me. But, I must ask, would you then say that they are showing bias for Hyundai by putting recommendation on a new model?&#148;You didn&#146;t want anything to do with the word bias here and understandably so. But you do seem to understand the point of credits getting transferred from an older Sonata. Then you go on to say about &#147;waiting more&#148;, which says nothing about &#147;projected&#148; reliability now does it? So, to answer the question you should have just said that you don&#146;t want to see CR recommending Sonata based on recent history. Why didn&#146;t you?If you don&#146;t believe in projections, don&#146;t. And you might as well refrain from making a point on it. But you did. So, how is this different from what CR is doing? Or, are we jumping on CR&#146;s throat for it being &#147;fairly biased&#148;?   If you\\'re just going to insult me when I make an honest attempt to respond to your questions, don\\'t bother to ask me any more questions. Especially questions that are based on faulty information or assumptions.If you want to bash someone because they decided not to follow your lead to go off-topic, that\\'s your problem.Let us know when you want to return to discussing mid-sized sedans rather than \"let\\'s have some fun with backy.\"  Insulting? Since you refuse to respond to questions directly, but still want to argue, I had to get around to get your response. So, may I ask you what was your point around this...\"You asked for my prediction, my opinion, and that\\'s it. Why? Simply, why not use all the weapons at your disposal in a war, instead of just one?\"And then you complain about getting insulted (somehow). :confuse:  I think you may have misread my response. I was trying to explain why I responded to the question as I did, i.e. that I saw Hyundai emphasizing quality and reliability in the future in addition to value, because they should use all the weapons they have available to them. I don\\'t know why you would be insulted by that response.I am insulted, however, that you would assume that I am trying to evade your questions and would be presumptous enough to write your own answers when you didn\\'t like mine. So don\\'t bother to ask me any more questions--just go ahead ahd answer them yourself; you\\'re very good at that.  Different day...Another case when Hyundai (Sonata) does something well, and deservedly so, wait, let\\'s try to see if CR is showing bias in the brand (car) two years from now...  2009:MMC and stability control finally on the Ford FusionDiesel Honda Accord6-speeds automatic replaces 4-speeds on all 4-cylinder Malibus (not just LTZ)MMC Hyundai Sonata with new interior (possible nav and bluetooth)MMC Toyota Camry (new 4 cylinder engine and maybe tranny fix for V6)Restyled Mazda6Lots of stuff to wait for.  I wonder if Toyota would refresh the Camry after only two model years. They typically wait at least 3 for a mid-gen refresh.Could 2009 be the year there\\'s another car at the top of the mid-sized heap, by press consensus? Maybe the new Mazda6?  Not to mention one has to pay an extra $1200, over the Camry LE price, to get the SE. Many other cars come with good handling standard on all trim levels. Ahhh, but didn\\'t you see the Lexus Commercial many years ago where they were touting the ability to drive over the wood planks along a railroad track without even feeling it? To some, the ride matters more than handling, and for those people, they seem to wish to be able to run over human bodies without noticing it one bit. Maybe they could drink a scalding hot cup of coffee and not worry about spilling any (without a lid) even while running over a curb? Isolation used to be advertised more. Maybe they like those cars like the Camry so much, so that when they do run someone over, since you can\\'t even feel it or notice it, it can\\'t very well be a hit and run can it? :P  It\\'s nice that CR admits its error in misleading its subscribers; it\\'s funnier that people still accept CR as gospel. I think CR and Toyota will get a pass from readers and consumers since they have been dead-on bullseye bulletproof reliable and spotless for over 15 years with the Camry. CR\\'s predictions seem to be far more accurate than JD Power\\'s advertised \"data.\"  the CR and JD Powers conversation in the Comments: Consumer Reports/JD Power Rankings discussion.  Could 2009 be the year there\\'s another car at the top of the mid-sized heap, by press consensus? Maybe the new Mazda6?Considering they won over 100 different awards with the first-gen...  MMC and stability control finally on the Ford Fusion What\\'s MMC?  Mid-model changeGenerally during the middle life cycle of a particular model.  Also known as a midcycle refresh.We\\'re hearing rumors that the 09 Fusion refresh might be delayed but no confirmation. I guess we\\'ll know for sure in January at NAIAS.  probably at LAIAS, from what I am hearing.MMC: Mid-model Change :P  I\\'m with you on that one...I don\\'t see \\'Yota refreshing the Camry after two model years. 2010 will bring the refreshed Camry, though toyota has been known to do partial changes. Like engine changes before a refresh, then refreshing the body itself.2010 brings a Refreshed Altima...and from what I\\'ve been seeing a new galant should be out by 2009. If its anything like the Lancer is now, the Galant might turn out to be competitive with the value leaders of the group.What\\'s funny is that the Midsize Family sedan forums are probably the most hotly contested forums on Edmunds.com yet NOBODY ever does many comparison tests on these cars anymore.Not yet have we seen a comparison of the new Accord verse more than the Camry. It\\'s a shame IMO. I\\'m ready to see the Malibu compared to others in this class as well because I really like the \\'Bu and have always liked the Aura.If Saturn made the Aura available with a I4 (which is going to be avaialble this year) with a stick shift. I\\'d take it over the Altima and everything else in this class except for maybe the new Accord.The Aura so far is my favorite domestic sedan.  If Saturn made the Aura available with a I4 (which is going to be avaialble this year) with a stick shift. I\\'d take it over the Altima and everything else in this class except for maybe the new Accord.The only reason why my wife didn\\'t buy the Aura was because of a lack of a manual. The Altima was her second choice, but won out due to the 6-speed with the 2.5.  Camry refresh may be \"early\" because the 2007 Camry actually came out early in 2006.  While the current generation (2004+?) was representative of Mitsubishi losing its mojo, if this is the new Galant, it looks as promising as the 1999 version did. And although has conceptual details to it, do I see an i-Drive thingy there (right by the knob based gear selector)? I detest those things.  nice quote from John McCormick-And talking of product brings us to the subject of appliances, a topic that Press knows well. His previous employer was and is the master of producing appliance-like vehicles. But to be fair to Toyota, that is the case to varying degrees with every major automaker in the world. Honda\\'s Accord has vied over the years with Toyota\\'s Camry for the title of world\\'s blandest car, yet both models are phenomenally successful (and the envy of many rivals). And therein lies the dilemma for the auto industry, especially in the U.S. market.-endAuto ApplianceI myself am willing to trade some degree of reliability for less boredom.  Car and Driver (and I) beg to differ. They call the outgoing Accord, and I quote\"the everyman\\'s car that bonds with enthusiasts...the powertrain is marvelous. It has torque, it is hot-blooded for revs...at redline the exhaust note snarls, a lively contrast to the other cars, which have nothing to offer but a rising crescendo of whirs, hums, and buzzes. Would you buy a sedan from the same guys who engineered the NSX? Of course you would...I haven\\'t driven a 2008 Accord, but this account of the outgoing 4-cyl model ring true for me!  I pity those guys. It seems they write these articles more out of frustration than to provide a fair view. Perhaps it is a result of insecurity of some sort. I\\'ve talked about and against \"soul\" in cars. But the term appliance, often an attempt to downplay success, makes more noise.Want appliance... you can\\'t miss look no further than most cars that come out of Detroit.  The more reviews I read about the 2008 Accord points to it being more of an appliance. Seems to have lost it\\'s edge by getting bigger, heavier and softer. Looks like interior fit and finish isn\\'t as good as before and road noise is still very noticeable. http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071025/COL14/710250367  at redline the exhaust note snarls, a lively contrast to the other cars, which have nothing to offer but a rising crescendo of whirs, hums, and buzzes.They must have a different one than me. You can\\'t hear the engine in my car at all except when you turn it on. Its not slow or underpowered, I just don\\'t understand why they are so afraid of people knowing there is an engine in the front of the vehicle and when you push the gas, the engine speeds up.  Stop reading reviews, and start driving. I haven\\'t driven the new Accord, but the points you made were the points made ten years ago as well. What happened? The larger, softer and heavier Accord is still an impressive car, for its ride quality and handling. Need proof?Perhaps those freep/detroit news guys could take a few lessons on driving from C&D.  I\\'m lost. What are you talking about? One of the best part about Hondas is that you can hear the engine well under throttle. Even better, that the sound is actually pleasing w/I-4 and w/V6.For a big NO, try Altima 2.5 w/CVT next.  The point the article was making was the new Accord took a step back while the competition has caught up or even surpassed it in several categories. The Accord is not so far ahead of the pack anymore. Actually looks like it\\'s trying to keep up. Traded in my 2005 Accord for a 07 Aura XR. Ride quality and handling to me is much more engaging. Proof that cars like the Fusion, Mazda6 and Aura have won over enthusiasts from Honda.  I\\'m lost. What are you talking about? One of the best part about Hondas is that you can hear the engine well under throttle. Even better, that the sound is actually pleasing w/I-4 and w/V6.I think that is definitely true of my \\'93. I liked the sound of that 2.2l 4 cylinder, especially going through the rev band in 3rd gear. It had a very connected feel. The \\'07 I don\\'t hear anything, I don\\'t even feel much; the car just goes faster (and it goes faster, faster too). The \\'05 Legacy you can hear and feel the engine working (even a little coarse sometimes). Its just a much more connected feel.  Again, those very same points were made ten years ago too. If you look closely, now and in the past (pick any period), Accord has never been at the top in anything except ownership cost, engine quality, ergonomics and may be dependability. When it comes to features, ride quality, handling etc, it usually finishes near top, never at the top.I\\'m not sure why people keep bringing up Aura and its handling, having rented it a few times, I haven\\'t found it yet. If anything, it lacks steering feel and response (and if GM is further softening it for Malibu as rumors suggest, it is going to be even worse).Accord\\'s handling hidden are those of a car that doesn\\'t scream handling on first glance. It is there, if you know and want to use it. I don\\'t have much experience with 2003-2007 Accord, however (and none with 2008) but enough to know it still maintains those attributes.Its got all that one needs to cruise at 80 mph without worries, even in cross winds, over bumps (no additional rebound) and with communicative steering (it lets you feel stuff that many cars dubbed \"good handling\" don\\'t). Even with almost 182,500 miles on the odometer, my 1998 tracks straight at high speed so much so that all you do is hold the steering lightly without having to do anything, even over bumps. The ratio tightens up and it feels as solid as can be expected. Those little things are often missed by most. They go more for the glitter.  Regardless, it still has had only two model years, 2007MY which came out around April of 2006, and 2008MY.Toyota is stopping production of the 2008 in Q1 next year, which is very weird, since the 08 has only been out for a very short months. Still, I think the 2009 will have minor cosmetic changes, if anything. We shall see.  Not yet have we seen a comparison of the new Accord verse more than the Camry.I have a hunch (not a prediction, just a hunch), that the car mags are waiting for the new Malibu to do their next midsized sedan comparo. It will make for a much more interesting story line to pit the all-new Accord against the new Malibu. Although maybe the Camry won\\'t make some comparos, like C/D\\'s, because it finished so low in its last comparo (behind the old Accord, the new Altima, and the Optima). So C/D might do the Accord vs. Malibu, and maybe the Altima and Optima. MT will probably include the Camry since it was their COTY last year. And as we know, Edmunds.com is planning a big face-off of the Accord, Camry, and Malibu in late November, using drivers they pick from contest entries. CR will undoubtedly do a test including the Accord and Malibu as soon as they can. So hold on, the comparos will be coming soon.  So, they may call it a 2010 model early in 2009.  I don\\'t know about you guys, but, after having bought a 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS and having a joyful time with it, I have wondered about a new Galant re-design from Mitsubishi coming along. And what does robertsmx provide a few short minutes later as I was reading up on all of the posts in this thread the past 5 days I\\'ve been busy at work?He posts a link to these pictures from Mitsu! Concepts, yes, but I can see the Lancer\\'s nose in this new Galant. This is the new design direction from Mitsubishi and it has grabbed me by the shorthairs to take notice, uh-huh.  Again, those very same points were made ten years ago too. If you look closely, now and in the past (pick any period), Accord has never been at the top in anything except ownership cost, engine quality, ergonomics and may be dependability.Actually, the Accord had quite a bit of value compared to it\\'s peers at one point. It really had a quality advantage that many other cars did not have maybe 10-15 years ago. But now that Consumer Reports and Jd Powers have shown that the difference in problems over 5 years for most of the cars in this class is around 1 additional problem from the most reliable to the least, that advantage is gone. And at the same time, initial purchase price being thousands more than many competitors with quality just as good to the Accord and in some cases better, Honda no longer has the advantage it once had. Yes, it is still a very good car and one that I would consider if I were in the market.... but I\\'d have to agree with those who have pointed out that the Accord seems to have softened in the current generation and that is a change I don\\'t welcome. Accord\\'s handling hidden are those of a car that doesn\\'t scream handling on first glance. It is there, if you know and want to use it. I don\\'t have much experience with 2003-2007 Accord, however (and none with 2008) but enough to know it still maintains those attributes.While I think the 03-07 Accord had decent handling compared to the previous gen Altima and Sonata, compared to the Legacy and Mazda6 it is not nearly as connected without increasing ride quality by a similar amount. Steering feel of the v-6 coupe I test drove was nowhere near as direct or confidence inspiring as the Subaru or Mazda. And why you\\'re talking about your 98 Honda\\'s handling in this forum (which is about new cars last I checked) doesn\\'t make sense to me. Should I talk about my 81 Accord and make a point about how underpowered and unsafe it was?  Completely agree with zzzoom6. Competition is has caught up and now there are many winners to choose from. Obviously your opinion of the Aura is that, just an opinion. Steering is very direct with a nice weighted feel, not light and over boosted like my old Accord. Handling is very good while being compliant over bumps. It won Car of the Year and beat out the Camry SE in the Autoweek comparo for many reasons. Seems like the Aura has proven itself to a great deal of auto enthusiasts to me.And seriously, this discussion is about current midsize cars. The reviews related to this discussion point to the current model year of each midsize car. If your stuck in a time warp that\\'s fine but can we stick to the topic? It\\'s like having someone compare an old E36 BMW to all the new luxury sports sedans in the market and saying how much better it is. Who does that?  i bought a \\'07 mazda 6 4 cyl, man trans. Before I bought I drove the civic, altima, and camry, figuring they were all contenders. Now I\\'m somewhat prejudiced since I had a \\'97 mazda 626 with 150,000 mi and no maintenance other than routine. The 6 is pretty nimble and with the man trans pretty quick(or seems that way). For the price I think it has the most bang for your buck.   I\\'m curious, why did you look at the Civic vs. the Accord, when all the other cars you looked at were mid-sized? Plus there are/were real good deals available on the \\'07 Accords now.  The Accord is not so far ahead of the pack anymore. Actually looks like it\\'s trying to keep up.You\\'re basing that on that one article. What about all the other road tests that say the Accord is still the target to shoot for? The Aura couldn\\'t even best the last Accord in C/D\\'s last comparison test. I don\\'t see Mr. Phelan being any more influential than the enthusiasts at C/D. Sales of the Aura are disappointing. Just because you went from an Accord to an Aura doesn\\'t prove anything.I happen to test drive an Aura when I had my Audi in for service. I don\\'t understand what all the hoopla is with this car; not only was it a big disappointment compared to my Audi, it was even one compared to my last Accord.Hey, you like the Aura and that\\'s great.  Obviously your opinion of the Aura is that, just an opinion. Steering is very direct with a nice weighted feel, not light and over boosted like my old Accord.Really? IMO, Aura\\'s steering is one of its shortcomings. And which generation of Accord are you talking about that has, apparently, overboosted steering? Based on my experience, Aura is Pontiac G6 with additional frills/aesthetic fixes, much like Milan is to Fusion. The only thing I like about in Aura is its auto transmission, and it could use better (real world) fuel economy.  Gm is known for rebadges but the Aura is FAAR more than an additional thrills/ aestetic fix over the G6. While they may share the same platform, they are far far more different the the Milan/Fusion or even the Milan/Fusion vs. the MKZ.that\\'s like saying the Accord and Acura TL are the same outside of aestheic fixe/additional frills.The Aura is a far better and more refined car than the G6 is.  here\\'s my 2 cents.I have a 1994 maxima GXE (amazing car). I go out of town once in a while and i get a rental (my car isn\\'t in the best of shape). Few weeks back, i got the saturn aura, picked it out just because there\\'s soo much commotion about it, \"best car from saturn yet\", \"north American car of the year (even though it\\'s essentially European)\". Any who, i took the saturn. Instantly found the seats to be hard, and the dash was made from what felt like melted down action figures. Absolutely terrible. If you don\\'t believe me go to the saturn dealership and try it yourself. Maybe the seat is better for some of you but the dash and interior quality in general is pretty bad, just give the dash a slight tap with your nails. Its pretty sad if the aura is saturns \"best car yet\". I don\\'t want to see what they made before. With that said, the aura did handle very nicely, but at the same time, im not going to a track, I\\'ll take comfort over handling in a mid sized sedan.Two weeks ago i took a camry (very easy choice after the aura). The seats were wayy better than the aura\\'s and initially i thought the car was pretty good. I saw why the camry is the best selling car in the US. So after about an hour in the car i started to fiddle with all the things. The more i fiddle the less impressed i was. The center stack was misaligned, plastics didn\\'t feel that good, center stack felt like the plastic from a box of valentine chocolates. Overall, still felt very cheap, very cost cutting, not quite as much as the aura though. I even noticed the carpeting coming off the floor of the car, i could see the wiring and chassis. This car was motor trends \"car of the year\" This car had ~4k miles on it. Very disappointing.For those who have never sat in a 94 maxima GXE, find one and sit in it, feel the dash, feel the materials. My dash is literally as soft as a baby\\'s butt. The steering wheel has actual leather with real stitching on it.edit: just thought about it and my 03 corolla has more rock scratches than my 94 maxima. the front hood of my 03 corolla has lots of tiny scratches from rocks that go all the way down to the actual hood. what has happened to paint? Frankly, I\\'ll take an extra 2 or 3 layers even if my MPG drops a little due to the weight of the extra paint...seriously. New cars are disappointing.Where have cars interiors gone? I mean....do i need to buy a premium brand to get the luxury of a 14 year old nissan?my second thought is more or less a question. The camry is now off my list, so is the aura/new malibu. How is the passat and the new accord? anyone have either of the cars and wanna shoot me some feed back about quality of the materials/comfort/etc.  Where have cars interiors gone?Cost cutting. Automakers are under extreme price pressure. That\\'s why you don\\'t see things like soft-touch materials everywhere any more. But to be fair, I think the automakers are trying their best to put the money into the important things on a car. For example, all those airbags cost money. So do high-powered, efficient, low-emissions engines. (How much power does that Maxima of yours put out? I\\'ll bet there\\'s some I4s in the mid-sized class today that would top it, or come close. And what\\'s its fuel economy, and emissions?) When you think about it, how often do you touch the dashboard--except to find out if it\\'s padded?Even the new Accord has a lot of hard plastic in it--less so as you move up the trim lines. But it\\'s quality plastic, for this class of cars. I think the Passat has a very nice interior for this class (VW does interiors well in general), but it\\'s also one of the most expensive cars in this class, if not the most expensive. So it should have a great interior. If you\\'re looking at a car like the Passat, you can afford to look one class up, e.g. Avalon, Azera, Lucerne, Taurus/Sable. Or maybe a slightly used luxury sedan?As for paint, the automakers are using water-based paint now (less pollution), and that might partly account for the drop in paint quality. And of course, thinner paint means lower cost.  i agree with you but cost cutting has its limits. misaligned interior bits? thats just crappy craftsmanship. also im fine with a hard dash, but make the areas where i rest my elbow/arm softer than the rest of the car. and how about a steering wheel not covered with hard plastic? how much more can those minor additions cost? i\\'ll pay an extra 100-200 bucks for it. i understand cost cutting if its in a kia rio. but if im paying in the neighborhood of 20,000 i\\'d like the car to be built decently.avalon is a little too big and ugly, looks like a whale, massive overhang. also the avalon is closer to 30k than 20k. still skeptical on hyundai/kia\\'s. No good long term info on them. I can get a VW 2.0T for 22ish, a well equipped accord is 22ish too. as i see it, the same thing that happened to American brands is happening to Japanese brands. GM and ford used to make properly great cars like the 72 monte carlo (i had one and loved it). They mass produced cars and quality and reliability suffered. At the same time the Japanese slowly nudged into the market. Americans couldn\\'t turn around fast enough and have always been behind the Japanese. With the new CTS and the upcoming G8 i can see some turn around happening. But until interior quality gets better americans wont flock to GM and ford dealerships like they do to honda and toyota\\'snow people say \"if we up quality we won\\'t make a profit\". subject A. Chevrolet Impala. Rebate: $4700 (friend of mine bought one for 17,xxx). Get rid of the 4700 dollar rebate and use it to build a car with newer technologies, better looking and feeling interior, more powerful engine.GM and ford are huge companies and if they cant make cars that are at the same level of quality as a toyota or honda. Here\\'s and idea GM has like 18 brands, if they start cutting those 18 down to maybe....2. A mainstream brand and a premium brand they\\'d save money and they could concentrate on making a decent car. instead they choose to use the same car for 4 brands and spend all their money on making it look different.

Ditto. Too many designs, competing for the same midsize buyer. Since Chevy is the most popular brand, Saturn, Pontiac, and Buick would have to go. At least two of those three. And isn\\'t the Saab 9-3 competing for the same customers too? Way too much spent on one size platform, IMO.  Ditto. Too many designs, competing for the same midsize buyer.

Way too much spent on one size platform, IMO.better yet, combine Saab and Cadillac and form one brand, Caddy could learn a lot from Saab. Like how to install a decent turbocharger.  Yes, when cost cutting affects quality, that\\'s none too good. It\\'s a tough mission to cut costs without affecting quality. There\\'s some ways to cut costs while improving quality, but when those are used up...If you can get a 2008 Passat 2.0T for $22k and like the car, why not just go ahead and get one? You said you were concerned about reliability (wrt the Korean cars). Have you taken a look at the reliability record of the 2.0T? For example, CR won\\'t even recommend it because of poor reliability.On the 2008 Accord, good luck getting anything more than an LX-P AT for $22k right now, until the new-design hoopla wears off. Have you seen the lease ads for the Accord lately? A few months ago they were $199/month for either an LX or SE-V6 (2007 models). Now they\\'re $259/month for an LX, with about the same money down.I haven\\'t seen a hard plastic steering wheel for a long time--maybe not since my mom\\'s 1980 Omega. That wheel was not only hard, but shiny, with faux wood trim. :P Cars today (the cars in this class at least) either have padded plastic or leather-covered wheels.Re profit and quality: Toyota is a very profitable company. But you used the Camry as an example of slipping quality. If any company could afford to put a few more bucks into quality interiors, it would be Toyota. But it\\'s not a priority for them. Why? Because look how many people buy the Camry with its interior with ill-fitting seams--an interior that was compared unfavorably to the less expensive Optima\\'s in C/D\\'s last mid-sized car comparo. As long as so many people flock into Toyota dealerships to buy cars like the Camry in huge numbers, why should Toyota put their profits into improving interiors? Maybe when more car buyers take notice and start looking elsewhere, as you have done, Toyota will do something about it.  Pengwin: the fit/finish and quality of materials used in the interiors of cars has nose dived the past 2 years with few exceptions. I leased a 2000 Toyota Solara SLE with leather and owned a 2005 Camry XLE with leather. Both of these cars had thick padded dashes, soft touch materials throughout and impeccable fit/finish. I currently own a 2005 Sienna and the the interior is very good. I leased a 2003 Mercury Mountaineer with leather and the interior quality was very good. I have a 1991 Camry and the interior is padded everywhere, same thing with a 1988 Accord I once owned.The following is a list of cars whose quality of interior materials and or fit/finish is worse than the previous generation. This is based on my either have test driven them/ sitting in them at auto shows or reading reviews on them ( and seeing photos online or in magazines):2008 Accord2007 and up Camry2007 BMW 5 Series2006 and up VW Passat2008 Mercedes Benz C Class2008 Ford Focus2008 Toyota HighlanderCurrent Generation Toyota CorollaAlmost all Dodges/Chryslers have terrible interior qualityOnly Nissan seems to have gotten better across the board.  You didn\\'t mention some other brands, e.g. Mazda (IMO the Mazda6\\'s interior is superior to that of the last 626), GM (improving, comparing the latest cars e.g. Aura and Malibu to those of a few years ago), Hyundai/Kia (interiors of current Sonata and Optima are much better than those of the previous generation cars). So it seems some brands with a reputation for quality interiors are slipping, and some of those who needed to improve are improving. Maybe soon we\\'ll have reached a level of similar quality across all but high-priced luxury cars.  Backy: GM has nowhere to go but up but it is true the Caddy CTS is stunning inside and the Buick Enclave is gorgeous. The new Malibu interior was too cheap looking and feeling. I was dissapointed. The Mazda CX-9 is stunning inside. You are right about Hyundai as well. Having owned a 2005 Camry, the minute I sat in the 2007 at the dealership I could tell in 5 seconds they cheapened it all over the place. The salesguy claimed Lexus complained that the top line Camry was stealing ES sales. Whatever the reason it still boggles my mind how people run to Toyota to A)trade in their current Camry for the new one and B)pay practically MSRP for it without noticing or caring about all the cheapness inside. The Ford Fusion and Nissan Altima use better material inside than the new Camry.  The northwest has many endearing qualities, but sunny fall weekends are few and far between. So with the sun out and many trees\\' leaves dressed in fall colors, I thought it would be well worth driving through the Columbia River Gorge with it\\'s amazing waterfalls and scenic views connected with miles of twisty roads and loads of elevation changes. Unfortunately though, much of the old Historic Columbia River Highway is very narrow with the some sections having just a dividing line on one side and barely the width of midsize car away is a concrete wall. When going around a series of 20mph curves it occurred to me that I was lucky to have a car that had very precise steering and one that wasn\\'t too wide. Having a large car or SUV would have made the drive not the joy that it was in the Mazda6 but instead an effort at accident avoidance. I know the trend is set that cars in this class will continue to get bigger in width and length and often in weight, but I can\\'t help but think that maybe some cars are moving past what is necessary or needed to a size that is bloated and just an effort to achieve bragging rights.  \"Only Nissan seems to have gotten better across the board.\"Perhaps, but only because they had a lot of room for improvement.When it comes to interior fit and finish it still comes down to VW, then Honda and then the rest.I got to say it cracks me up when I read that someone\\'s 1988 Accord interior is better in some way then today\\'s Accord. I\\'ve owned Accords from that period and their interiors were top notch for the day but by today\\'s standards they\\'re pretty dreadful. I can guarantee you that after a 4 hour trip your back is going to feel much better in a 2008 Accord then a 1998 Accord.One area where all the car manufacturers seem to be cutting cost is the protective moldings on the side of the car.At least Audi seems to be keeping to their expected standards.  I have seen several people complain about Camry being favored by CR as they recommend even the new model by default. That doesn&#146;t seem to be an issue with Focus being recommended when it first came out. I think this has been clarified by others already. The Focus had the highest score in their testing, this has nothing to do with reliability. On the pricing I was talking about the actual net transaction prices, not artificial figures like MSRP. By your own numbers Fit is comparably priced to Focus, since the rebate exceeds to $2000 price differential that you came up with. so far the Fusion has not required large incentives, but still selling prices are, I think, closer to the civic than to the Accord. Will the lower prices for comparable cars mean that Ford can still not afford to invest as much in upgrading the Fusion as Toyota and Honda can for the Accord and Camry???BTW, you mentioned somewhere not subscribing to CR, I don\\'t either, my library provides free online access (available from home with my library card number) to CR as well as hundreds of other magazines. In the case of CR there is a 3 month embargo. Check your library website, if my library that serves a population of only about 20,000 provides this access, I\\'m sure many others do also.  Ford can still not afford to invest as much in upgrading the FusionI have read that there will be a hybrid Fusion in 2008,but I seriously doubt that anyone will be able to find one at a dealer showroom. :confuse:  Many sports cars are wider than one would thing they need to be. Corvette is 72.6\", that might be comparable to many full size cars. And the new Nissan GT-R is supposed to be 2\" wider! Thats SUV territory. Somehow I feel that carving those roads won\\'t be bigger issue in those cars.Its not the size, rather how cars drive. Some big cars drive small, and some small cars feel bigger than they are. This goes beyond spec sheet.  You said you were concerned about reliability (wrt the Korean cars). Have you taken a look at the reliability record of the 2.0T? For example, CR won\\'t even recommend it because of poor reliability.true, sadly, CR recommended the Camry, which I rented from Alamo. I drove it from STL to chicago, along the way, low tire pressure light came on, then off, then on, then off... Engine light came on for about 15 mins along the way. And my favorite feature would easily be the gasoline air refresher that they installed in the car. Revs go above 3000 and the refresher kicks in. For those of you who didnt pick up on the sarcasm. When you go to pass someone and the revs go above 3000 a very big whiff of gasoline scent tingles your nose hairs. After that, i stopped listening to CR and the like. I\\'ll read them and take it for what they are, words. Honestly though, before you buy a car go rent it. Pay the 100 bucks or 200 bucks to rent it for 3 or 4 days, it\\'s the ultimate test drive you can see how the car takes abuse (everyone abuses rentals), you can push it to the limits, etc.I had the Mazda 6 for a week while my car was getting fixed, someone decided they wanted to use my corolla\\'s front left bumper to stop them rather than their brakes. I believe it was an 80\\'s caprice, huge metal bumper, tore right through my poor little corolla\\'s front fender/bodypanel. Back to the mazda. I did like the dash, was made from the \"BMW dash\" material. Nothing felt \"cheap\" but nothing felt expensive, and the car felt sluggish and the precise steering didn\\'t help speed the car up so i found that useless. What i hated the most was the material used on the doors. Mazda used like a cloth mixed with rubber...it wasn\\'t like the VW fake leather but its more rubbery and clothy?(sp). Im not sure how to describe it but it was soft to the touch but irritating to my arm.On a slightly different note, i owned a 1989 toyota corolla, tranny went bad in the first 30 days but the replacement lasted 230k miles. I never changed the timing belt or anything else but oil, air filter and brakes. At 230k miles, my car was stolen and crashed into the back of a truck. :mad: So it led me to buy a new car, a corolla. I wasn\\'t a fan of the interior but if it was gonna last as long as the old one, i wouldn\\'t mind. At 63k miles my dealership said my tranny was bad. They didn\\'t catch the problem when i was still under warranty...odd. It was going to cost $5k to repair a $15k so i decided not to. My car is now at 140k miles, its an 03 corolla and compared to my 89, its interior quality went down, doesn\\'t feel nearly as fast as the old one, 89 blew colder air, was easier to see out of, had better paint, better seats, cheaper tires (25 bucks a tire!)...come to think about it my new corolla doesnt have anything different from my old one (on the center stack). 89 and 03 both have radio\\'s, air con, defroster etc, clock, no CD player in the 89 or fancy stero. Well, atleast the new one still runs.  Whatever the reason it still boggles my mind how people run to Toyota to A)trade in their current Camry for the new one and B)pay practically MSRP for it without noticing or caring about all the cheapness inside. People do seem to make rash and speedy purchase decisions without even comparing or researching any facts, figures, or vehicles. They just see something they like (the 1st car they look at) and are willing to get it, because undoubtedly a brand new car will most likely be much better than their old one.If their last Toyota was their first car to be absolutely flawless and a perfect ownership experience, then of course they\\'ll go back and get another.No one besides Toyota and Honda have been able to retain the amount of customers they do due to quality.  re 6767\"I just don\\'t understand why they are so afraid of people knowing there is an engine in the front of the vehicle ...\" Sorry, but I don\\'t understand why people are so afraid of a \"quiet engine\". It obviously isn\\'t necessary to have a noisy one. I know that any engine, when pushed, will make more \"noise\" than one at a nominal speed. I find no problem with that, however many seem to object to those that prefer the lessor sound. I enjoy being able to converse with my fellow travelers, or to enjoy the sound of the music without having to scream, or turn the volume up extra loud. This is one of those areas where each of us has to decide for ourselves.van  Honestly though, before you buy a car go rent it. Good advice. I\\'ve learned a lot about potential car purchases by driving them as rentals. I\\'m fortunate to be able to drive many rentals at the expense of my employer though.   The article your refering to compares the XE. I have an XR which is a big difference. My switching cars proves to me what I like, and of course it\\'s an opinion like everyone else\\'s. But when a lot of people share the same opinion then there has to be some fact in the matter. So we can now bring into this discussion luxury sports sedans? I hope an Audi is better then my Aura. Your paying 10-15K more for your car. And btw, I used to own a 330i ZHP and I test drove an S4 at the time which was a big disappointment.  Perhaps, but only because they (Nissan) had a lot of room for improvement. Nissans interiors were never pitiful. GM owned that category. They were average. Now IMO the Altima has surpassed the Camry inside. When it comes to interior fit and finish it still comes down to VW, then Honda and then the restYes, and both have gotten worse with the current generation of the CR-V/Accord/Passat/Jetta.I got to say it cracks me up when I read that someone\\'s 1988 Accord interior is better in some way then today\\'s Accord. I\\'ve owned Accords from that period and their interiors were top notch for the day but by today\\'s standards they\\'re pretty dreadful. I can guarantee you that after a 4 hour trip your back is going to feel much better in a 2008 Accord then a 1998 Accord. You are missing the point in some respects here. I drive my in laws 1996 Camry on regular ocassion. I have test driven the 2007 Camry and sat in them for as long as I wanted at dealerships and car shows. I have been in the cloth seats and the top of the line XLE with leather. Clearly the 2007 version is much roomier inside and I would estimate to be more comfortable on long trips. The 2007 is much better lit inside with the gauge cluster and the overhead lights. The interior layout is pleasing to the eye with a modern swooped dash and flowing center stack/console and an open feel. The colors inside are pleasing as well. The 1996 by contrast is a dull looking saddle brown with no offsetting colors. The gauges are the old back lit design and there is one interior dome light that cannot be turned on from a dash switch. The center stack/console is a plain square. It looks dated now and to be frank wasn\\'t very exciting in 1996 either. HOWEVER, the material quality and fit and finish are superior in the 1996. The 2007 Camry has hard plastic door handles. The \\'96 are thickly padded as is the upper door pads and armrests. The 2007 foregos padding and inserts cheap plastic wherever it can get away with it. The carpeting and trim pieces in the 96 have held up remarkably well for 207,000 miles and counting. There is also not a rattle or squeak in the console or glove box door. The 2007 carpet is thin and you can see the staples coming up. I\\'d love to see it hold up half as well as the \\'96. The plastic door handles have plastic centers that clip into place which was already falling out of some of the cars I sat in. The center console does not line up on any of the 2007\\'s I saw. I have read reviews on edmunds about squeaks and rattles in cold weather on 3 month old Camry\\'sWe expect a 2007 Toyota Camry to have superior design, comfort and functionality than a 1996 Camry. What I did not expect and what the car buying public should not tolerate is the downgraded quality and fit and finish for a car that Toyota is asking us to pay in excess of 30k for a loaded XLE V6.Just look online at many 2007 Camry reviews. Sure, there are plenty of positive ones but there is an astonishingly high amount of people complaining for a Toyota and the cheap interior comes up an awful lot. I never thought I would say this but I like the Ford Fusion/Mercury Milan better. I have to eat crow on that one too because in the spring of 2006 I ridiculed the the upcoming Fusion saying no way it could be as nice as the soon to be launched 2007 Camry.  nicely put pmerk. I\\'d go beyond that. I\\'m willing to bet the 1996 camry will last longer than an 07 camry. I think the shoddy quality has gone beyond interiors. I\\'m also willing to bet its going to show up in the engine/transmission and other mechanical areas. Didn\\'t toyota recently recall like half a million vehicles?My initial plan was to get a camry, after renting the new camry it made me look at German brands. But supposedly VW\\'s are a hit or miss, if you get lucky you get a tank and it\\'ll rarely break down and if you\\'re unlucky you get a lemon and VWoA doesn\\'t help you at all.I\\'ve never bought a honda before, always felt toyota was more reliable mechanically and i\\'m not pick about interiors as long as it doesn\\'t feel cheap for its price. Thats why i don\\'t complain about my corolla\\'s fairly crappy interior.The world is running out of mainstream car companies. It seems like you have to spend a minimum of 30k for a good car today. what about buick... comes high in reliability ratings but i cant believe that because it\\'s essentially a rebadged chevy. Anyone have any recommendations? The new corolla going to be any good?  >What i hated the most was the material used on the doors. Mazda used like a cloth mixed with rubber...it wasn\\'t like the VW fake leather but its more rubbery and clothy?(That sounds like the doors on the 07 Accords I checked out at the dealer a few months back.  Don\\'t laugh. Try a Hyundai Sonata. You\\'ll be pleansently surprised. Today\\'s Hyundai is not what it was 15 or 20 years ago. Hyundai has been getting good reliability ratings for over 5 years.  My initial plan was to get a camry, after renting the new camry it made me look at German brands. But supposedly VW\\'s are a hit or miss, if you get lucky you get a tank and it\\'ll rarely break down and if you\\'re unlucky you get a lemon and VWoA doesn\\'t help you at all. Correct on VW.The world is running out of mainstream car companies. It seems like you have to spend a minimum of 30k for a good car today. what about buick... comes high in reliability ratings but i cant believe that because it\\'s essentially a rebadged chevy. Anyone have any recommendations? The new corolla going to be any good? Buicks been reliable for a while now. They are made better than Chevy and Buick pays attention to noise levels. Buick only has three models now. The Lacross and Lucerene won\\'t appeal much to anyone under 60 but sitting inside them they are a cut above Pontiac/Chevy. They feel and look solid. The enclave is going to be a smash, i believe, it\\'s that nice. But now we are talking SUV and we are talking 40 grand for a loaded one.Take a look at the Ford Fusion. An awful lot of car for the money.  The article your refering to compares the XE. I have an XR which is a big difference.True, it was the base model. But a lot of the complaints C/D had with the XE would also apply to the XR.My switching cars proves to me what I like, and of course it\\'s an opinion like everyone else\\'s. But when a lot of people share the same opinion then there has to be some fact in the matter.What fact would that would be? That the Accord is now in a position of keeping up? You found one article that backs your opinion and now it\\'s a fact. When it comes to a numbers game of who\\'s opinion is the same as yours and who\\'s opinion is the same as mine you\\'ll come short. The only fact that\\'s out there is that for you and others the Aura is the better car. There\\'s no argument there.So we can now bring into this discussion luxury sports sedans? I hope an Audi is better then my Aura. Your paying 10-15K more for your car.More like $7-8K as I went easy on the options. The point wasn\\'t that I thought the Audi was the superior car but how disappointing I found the Aura to be compared to my last Accord.  I suggest getting a car that performs best for you. That\\'s something you\\'ll notice every time you get in your car. When it comes to reliability you\\'re talking about only a few percentage points between a reliable car and one that\\'s not so reliable.As far as Buicks go, sure they\\'re reliable but very mediocre in quality otherwise. I think the only reason Buick is rated higher than their GM counterparts in reliability is that the elderly are easier on them.   Sorry, but I don\\'t understand why people are so afraid of a \"quiet engine\". It obviously isn\\'t necessary to have a noisy one. I know that any engine, when pushed, will make more \"noise\" than one at a nominal speed. I find no problem with that, however many seem to object to those that prefer the lessor sound. I enjoy being able to converse with my fellow travelers, or to enjoy the sound of the music without having to scream, or turn the volume up extra loud. This is one of those areas where each of us has to decide for ourselves.I concur, I agree there are definitely different strokes for different folks. I have never been in an enclosed vehicle where I felt I had to raise my voice to converse with passengers or add an amplifier to the stereo to keep up, but at the same time, I do appreciate the sound of an engine, and its mechanical song.  Yes, and both have gotten worse with the current generation of the CR-V/Accord/Passat/Jetta.Can\\'t speak to the CR-V as I avoid SUVs like they\\'re the plague. Of course they\\'re useful when I need to haul something. Then it\\'s time to talk to my brother.As far as the new Accord. I haven\\'t had a chance to examine the Accord\\'s interior throughly but my initial impressions are that it hasn\\'t gotten worse.Passat. I agree with you there and I think VW is paying dearly for that as their customers have the same opinion as us. But it\\'s still best in class though.Jetta. I was disappointed that it didn\\'t improve over the last one but I don\\'t think the car got worse either except for the trunk lining. When you get wood trim you still get real wood. When you get leather you still get high quality leather.I have to wonder if you have a negative reaction to design changes. That you have a comfort level for what you\\'re used to. Case in point, harder plastic doesn\\'t necessary mean it\\'s of lower quality. It\\'s more the texture and flimsiness of the plastic that determines its quality.  Jetta. I was disappointed that it didn\\'t improve over the last one but I don\\'t think the car got worse either except for the trunk lining. When you get wood trim you still get real wood. When you get leather you still get high quality leatherYes, you are correct I instinctively paired it with the Passat.I have to wonder if you have a negative reaction to design changes. That you have a comfort level for what you\\'re used to. Case in point, harder plastic doesn\\'t necessary mean it\\'s of lower quality. It\\'s more the texture and flimsiness of the plastic that determines its qualityRe-read my post 6803 on the Toyota Camry.  I did. Never mind that physco babble stuff I was muttering earlier. Sorry.   > sure they\\'re reliable but very mediocre in quality otherwise.I have to disagree with you about that, They are good in quality in all ways. I see more elderly who\\'ve swallowed the Camry/Accord kool aide I would think their ratings would be going up if your comment that elderly are easier on them were even close to true. In fact, they\\'re pickier about what they\\'ll tolerate in a car despite that they like some other aspect of the car. They take it in to be fixed.  rented the sonata twice, the current model, what is it now? 2nd generation? When the sonata came out it looked exactly like the accord, thats the one i rented. I\\'m sorry, i dont keep up on Hyundai\\'s. I didnt like the sonata both times. It wasn\\'t bad but I cant justify 18k on a V6 sonata. The interior is just ugly. The radio/stero area looks like hyundai made the whole dash in mass production, put it in the car then had someone test drive. The test driver came out of the car after a lap and said, \"...where\\'s the flippin\\' radio?\". They went back into the car with a hack saw and cut half a circle, shoved a radio in it and called it a day.If i buy a hyundai, hands down it\\'ll be an azera. But i have the same opinion about the azera as the sonata. if hyundai can get the azera\\'s interior upto the grade of the Veracruz i\\'d be more than happy to buy it. I have not driven the Azera yet, i\\'ll have to book a car on Hertz next time i go out of town, when i drove by last time i saw a few azera\\'s on their lots.As far as plastics go. A great example of crappy plastics is the aura. Tap the dash, any where on the dash. The noise you\\'ll receive is hollow. It sounds as if there\\'s nothing behind it, if you tap the new camry, as much as i dislike it, won\\'t have that hollow-ness. I think you can use the cheapest materials in the world but if its soft to the touch and not uncomfortable it\\'s fine by me. Take mazda 6\\'s rubber dash, its cheap but it doesnt feel cheap.As far as the Passat goes. If i do decide to buy one anyone have any suggestions as to how I can pick the \"tank\" Passat rather than the lemon. Should i be looking for loose cables or...you guys are the experts, at least some of you  , what\\'s your 2 pennies on that?  I did. Never mind that physco babble stuff I was muttering earlier. SorryLol. No problem. I did examine myself mentally and came out ok, I think anyway.Seriously, what caused me to agree with you on the Jetta was that an acquaintance of mine got some really low lease deal on a Wolfsburg edition Jetta. I remember being struck by how nice the interior was -both the design AND the quality of material/fit/finish.  Here\\'s a link to some spy pics of what is supposedly the new dash for the 2009 Sonata. 2009 Sonata Interior Spy Pics?If correct this is a major upgrade for the interior. It should be interesting to check it out when it comes out, likely in the mid-to late spring.  Well it\\'s true that Camry and Accord drivers are getting older and apparently bigger and heavier, but they\\'re no where near as old as Buick drivers. Now that\\'s a fact. However, it\\'s not a fact that the elderly are pickier about their cars.  Looks like the interior it should have had all along. The current version, to me, is the least desirable interior design I may have ever seen. The newer Hyundai interiors (Elantra, Santa Fe, Vera Cruz) are MUCH better to me.  >that\\'s a fact.You\\'re welcome to your opinion. But it\\'s not a fact in this area.  Ergonomically, the Sonata\\'s dash is not bad at all. At least the shifter doesn\\'t block major controls, like it does on the Fusion/Milan. Some people carp about the radio, but its controls are easy to reach and simple (maybe some folks don\\'t like it because it doesn\\'t have a maze of buttons as on some other cars). The rotary HVAC controls on the models w/o auto climate control are silky smooth and simplicity itself in their operation. And the vents are positioned so they don\\'t blow directly on the driver\\'s right hand, which is a problem on many cars. Yes, the plood trim is not very convincing, but in grey (with faux carbon fiber trim instead of plood) or especially black the Sonata\\'s dash is not the disaster some folks make it out to be. But the dash supposedly coming for 2009 does look a lot nicer, more up to date.  Don\\'t get me wrong buddy. I had no problem with the quality of the interior; it was on par with most cars in the class; better than several. It was the look of the thing. It had no continuity. It didn\\'t look like interior \"design\" at all, actually. Just a jumble pieces stuck together. Vent placement is also poor for circulation of air to the rear of the car (unless there are rear-vents built into the back of the console?).I drive at 9 and 3, and vent placement up high doesn\\'t hit my hands in my Accord. It didn\\'t have ergonomic issues like the Fusion, it just failed to be pleasing to the eye. I felt like Honda nailed it on both (in the previous gen, not the 2008 model). Personally I prefer any Elantra from the last 6 years\\' interior over the current Sonata.All that said, the MMC interior looks LOADS better. It should help sales, IMO. Any word on putting the 5-speed Auto in the 4-cyl for 2009, as in the Optima?  Here\\'s a link to some spy pics of what is supposedly the new dash for the 2009 Sonata.2009 Sonata Interior Spy Pics? nice, new sonata looks good but i don\\'t think i can wait that long. I\\'ll try.I test drove a Subaru Legacy. The interior was really very nice. I just hate the fact that the turboed version costs 30k (at which point i\\'d buy an ES350). Also it gets crap mileage and a non turbo doesnt make sense to me. Love the pillarless doors, every car company should do that. Any one here own a Legacy? feedback?  Some of the key features posted in the Sonata facelift thread:*Azera lookin front end*Horsepower increase for both 4cyl and V6*Improved fuel economy for both engines*5 speed auto trans for 4cyl*Blue background dashboard lights*Improved handling and ride*Specific sport handling for SE model*Redone interior featuring, more storage,better finish,less plastic looking*USB port and i-pod jack*Exhaust tuned for performance sound*Optional LG navigation system  Thanks for the info joe!  I think the biggest problem of the current Sonata dash is the thin plood horizontal strip with a silvery accent, which breaks the dash in two. Also the silvery molding around the HVAC cluster is something out of the 1980s. That\\'s why I think the current dash looks a lot better in grey (no plood) and best in monotone black (although I don\\'t like black interiors in general).Word is that the 2009 Sonata I4s will get a 5-speed AT--only 3 years after the Optima got one. :surprise:  That info contradicts other info on the Web that says the 2009 Sonata\\'s front end will resemble that of the Genesis.  I just copied what was posted there Personally, I\\'d want nothing changed on the exterior. I like the clean and crisp look.  You\\'re welcome to your opinion. But it\\'s not a fact in this area.Um, it\\'s not a matter of opinion. Either the average age of Accord and Camry drivers is lower than those who drive Buicks or it\\'s not. In other words, I\\'m either correct or I\\'m wrong with my statement no matter where I state it.The average Buick car buyer is 68, the average Accord car buyer is 50 and the average Camry buyer is 55.  Nissans interiors were never pitiful. GM owned that category. They were average. Now IMO the Altima has surpassed the Camry inside.My mother has a \\'03 Altima that proves this wrong. It\\'s quite possibly the WORST interior (both in materials and fit-and-finish) that I\\'ve ever sat in. The \\'07-up Altima has improved immensely, but GM has greatly improved their interiors in MOST of their brands, including the new full-size SUVs and the Aura.Unfortunately, the G6 seemed to be cursed with the old-school interior design.Best interiors in this price class? VWThe worst? A draw between the Avenger/Sebring and G6  Best interiors in this price class? VW Indeed, although the Passat got worse even though they keep raising the prices on it.The worst? A draw between the Avenger/Sebring and G6 I sat in every 2007 Dodge/Chrysler sedan or coupe and the hard plastic interiors are the worst on the market today. Only the 300 was adequate. Disgraceful. I hear the \\'08\\'s are improved....Unfortunately, the G6 seemed to be cursed with the old-school interior design. The G6 made me seasick when I was a passenger in one and the interior is beyond dreadful  Backy - if you follow Hyundai and Kia closely, and I know you do, Hyundai corporate seems to launch many of its new designs and ideas first with Kia, then they filter down to the Hyundai product line. Although the designs may be derivatives, Hyundai seems to use Kia as somewhat of a \"Beta Tester.\" The Optima with the 2.4L DOHC I4 with the 5-speed auto, as compared to the Sonata with the 2.4L I4 with the 4-speed auto is a perfect example. You can see this also with the current Spectra vs. the old Elantra. I wonder why?  I test drove a Subaru Legacy. The interior was really very nice. I just hate the fact that the turboed version costs 30k (at which point i\\'d buy an ES350). Also it gets crap mileage and a non turbo doesnt make sense to me. Love the pillarless doors, every car company should do that. Any one here own a Legacy? feedback?We have an 05 Legacy 2.5i Wagon 5 speed. Model-wise, it was comparable with the Accord LX sedan, although the Subaru was less expensive. It has the 165hp non-turbo 4 cylinder, which is perfectly adequate, even when dragging a 2000lb trailer. We have enjoyed the AWD as well as the wagon body style. Visibility is excellent. I think my main regret with the purchase is not going with the 2.5 \"Limited\" which gets heated seats/mirrors and a sunroof. The car gets in the high 20s (wife driving - I think she has weights in her shoes) or low 30s (me driving)The ride quality is a little too active for some, but I really like it. The flat-4 isn\\'t as smooth as the Camry, but again, I have enjoyed it.If you are concerned with infant seats, you might want to bring that with you to do a fit check. Using the middle seating position with the lap-shoulder belt makes the seat hard to balance, and using the LATCH means you lose the 2 outboard seating positions, making it a 3 seat vehicle (the Accord can have the baby seat in the middle and fine access to the 2 outboard seating positions).The pillarless doors and frameless windows look cool but will occasionally leak in a car wash; i haven\\'t had an issue on the road though, even driving through weather.  Increasing average age is part and parcel of a successful product and a loyal customer base. A recent study quoted Honda/Acura having the greatest customer retention of major brands in Canada, with 66% of Honda/Acura owners buying another Honda/Acura. The article didn&#146;t list the second best but it was down by 6% (I&#146;m guessing Toyota/Lexus). The worst is Mazda with 25%. (link)Besides that, in a competitive segment that also competes with SUVs, selling 350K-400K units per year is a big deal, more so when you factor in virtually non-existent fleet sales. Combine the two, work some numbers and you will see why average age grows by the year.To quote an example, IIRC average age of Accord buyer was 43 for sixth generation Accord which was launched ten years ago. A decade later, let us assume 60% of those 375K buyers get 2008 Accord. But, average age is now 50, right? Consider the fact that those 225K repeat buyers now average 53. So, for the new 150K buyers that Honda gained, the average age can&#146;t be more than 28! This is based on a rather oversimplified math, but you should get the point.To reduce average age, the first thing automakers will have to do is to ensure that they don&#146;t have a loyal base that grows over time. How many automakers want to make that claim, or make it a business practice?Having a perspective can change a lot, doesn&#146;t it? Increasing average age can be seen as a major issue if it grows faster than the age of cars. An exponential growth is fine, as it promises to stabilize (but probably won&#146;t decrease). Another key is how an automaker chooses to design a car. Honda may take a slightly different approach for next generation Accord. The 2008 redesign is along the lines that worked for 1998-2002 generation. Very few 2003-2007 buyers are expected to trade in for the new car, unless leasing which might be a very low number by itself. It is all about understanding the customer base and designing around it.Besides, average age of buyers in America has been growing anyway, as is average price of a new car which is said to be around $24K.  When it comes to VW, may I suggest that you make sure to blow the catalytic converter right before you hit 80K mile mark. Two of my three friends with VWs ended up spending quite a bit starting with that, and right after that warranty was thru. Those cars were \"irreplaceable\" until that point for both of them. One has already moved on and another is contemplating.When it comes to interior, VW does a great job in details (but sucks in terms of ergonomics). I have not had an opportunity to be in newer VWs, but the older models had nice soft touch plastics around door handles and all. They are hard, but feel rich (another example of not all plastics being created equal). However, it seems to come with a price.Here is an example:Both of my friends with 5-6 year old VWs had this issue, more pronounced in one of them. The idea that makes the plastic feel good is also a risky affair as it seems to have a tendency to peel off and create a mess. The radios have plenty of nail marks against relatively soft plastic as well. On the other hand, there is absolutely no way to make an impact like that on these (radio from my 1998 Accord), it is harder plastic but great quality to touch and feel.A lot of people also seem to prefer soft touch dash board. I have never understood the point. I had it in my 2000 Civic but top of the dash in my 1998 Accord is hard plastic (but doesn&#146;t look like it). The lower part is padded however (Honda). VWs from that era have rubbery top of the dash but hard plastic below it (VW)Personally, I will take anything that looks good. Feels good is limited to areas I actually use. I have also found it easier to maintain the hard dash on my 1998 Accord than padded part of it, and it was also a challenge in the Civic. Now dash texture like this will never get my vote.VW\\'s do have great finishing however, well detailed even in some hidden areas (sometimes it becomes a nuisance, however, as when trying to replace something as simple as a headlamp).  re 6810Fortunately, today\\'s vehicles are much better that way (sound suppressing, while allowing the engine sound presence) than those of the past. I fully understand that song too. van  I don\\'t know if Kia in general is the \"Beta tester\" for new designs and derivatives. For example:* Gen 3 Sonata used its platform several years before the Optima got it.* Elantra got the tweaked Beta II (with better fuel economy) before the Spectra.* Sonata (and all other Hyundais) got XM radio before Kia.* Sonata got active rear suspension (not yet available in the U.S.) before any Kia.* Sonata (and some other Hyundais) will get factory nav before any Kias.* Sonata got the 2.4L I4 over a year before any Kia got it.* Sonata (and other Hyundais) got the 3.3L V6 (and Azera the 3.8L variant) before any Kias got it.* Elantra SE got standard ESC before the Spectra (still not offered on the Spectra).So I guess I don\\'t buy the \"beta tester\" idea. I think the features each model gets is just based on which model is due for a redesign at a given time. The 2006.5 Optima came out about 18 months after the Sonata (ROK debut in the fall of 2004), and that may account for why it got the 5-speed AT on the I4 rather than the 4-speed that the Sonata got. Maybe the 5-speed wasn\\'t ready in 2004.  The pillarless doors and frame less windows look cool but will occasionally leak in a car wash; i haven\\'t had an issue on the road though, even driving through weatherThis will be the last generation that the Legacy has no door frames. Subaru is going to full frame doors. Look at the new Impreza.  Nissans interiors were never pitiful. GM owned that category. They were average. Now IMO the Altima has surpassed the Camry inside. My mother has a \\'03 Altima that proves this wrong. It\\'s quite possibly the WORST interior (both in materials and fit-and-finish) that I\\'ve ever sat in. The \\'07-up Altima has improved immensely, but GM has greatly improved their interiors in MOST of their brands, including the new full-size SUVs and the Aura. I agree completely. Nissans in general were pretty pitiful; Quest, Armada, even the Infiniti version of the Armada the QX56 was POOR. My buddy\\'s 1997 Maxima GXE has substantially better interior quality than the 02-04 Altimas did. The new one supposedly corrects this. I hope to see for myself at the NAIAS when it comes to Birmingham in two weeks.  Sure, there are plenty of positive ones but there is an astonishingly high amount of people complaining for a Toyota and the cheap interior comes up an awful lot. I never thought I would say this but I like the Ford Fusion/Mercury Milan better.I have to admire your honesty, pmerk. My wife and I own a 2007 SEL AWD Ford Fusion and the interior fit and finish is outstanding, and one of our favorite features. The materials are top notch.  I have to admire your honesty, pmerk. My wife and I own a 2007 SEL AWD Ford Fusion and the interior fit and finish is outstanding, and one of our favorite features. The materials are top notch. The Fusion/Milan interior is surprisingly nice and the materials used are of better quality than the Camry. Fit and finish is more than competitive - in fact it looks to me like the Ford was assembled better. The Fusion is weaker in the design department. The Camry\\'s electroluminescent gauges are beautiful and ultra modern. Fords are sort of a retro look with a green lighting. The Camry has a more modern looking center stack while the Ford uses that old green LCD display for the radio and climate controls. Both need to be updated. Camry also has a nicer steering wheel. That being said I liked the Fusion better overall.  We use Ford Fusion\\'s as loaner vehicles at my Mazda store. I really do not think the Fusion\\'s have nicer interiors then the Camry. Materials are on par with Toyota, but, I do not think they are put together all that well. I have yet to sit in a Milan.  Looked at the 2008 Taurus this weekend with my dad (for my grandmother). I have to say, it wasn\\'t half bad. Much better than any Nissan I\\'ve been in lately.  Both need to be updated.Good point. I agree.  I agree, the new Taurus/Sable have pretty nice interiors, but the Fusions seem to use lower grade materials.My mother in law has a 2004 Maxima, and it is not all that nice either. Her previous Maxima (1998) had nicer materials and build quality.  My mother in law has a 2004 Maxima, and it is not all that nice either. Her previous Maxima (1998) had nicer materials and build quality. Yep, my buddy\\'s \\'97 (same car you mom-in-law\\'s \\'98) is a base model, but has quality that is dang good, especially considering it\\'s age.It isn\\'t all that great ergonomically, especially with that tiny fan speed knob, but it has no major flaws in fit or finish. It DOES have one flaw otherwise though; it\\'s a horrible camel color that is somewhere between tan and yellow. In the brochure for 1997, I believe the color choices were black, grey, and blaeksch (the sound made when viewing the color). I have driven the car once or twice and noticed it has steering lighter than any vehicle I\\'ve ever piloted. It was accurate enough, but very VERY light and quite numb as well.  but the Fusions seem to use lower grade materials. What is your point of reference? S, SE or SEL trims? Camel with fake wood or black/light stone with piano black trim?There is a big difference between a S or SE Camel interior vs. a SEL in black or light stone with the piano black accents.Check out the 2009 Flex (which is a step-up from the Taurus/Sable interiors) for a better clue as to the future Fusion interiors.  I believe they are base 4 cyl\\'s with a carbon fiber like dash trim. I think the interior\\'s are gray or black? We also have one V6 in Red with a beige interior with leather and larger alloy wheels.They are all out right now, so I cannot confirm what models they are.  alright, so what car company overall has the best reliability/interior.personally the new accord\\'s interior looks massively cluttered. if i had a choice now i\\'d buy an \"optioned up\" 07 for the price of an 08.The camry is definitely out of the question after my experience with it.Never owned a VW before. I just presumed that they were reliable because i see all those old VW bugs and \"hippie vans\" (dont know what they\\'re called) still driving around.  Never owned a VW before. I just presumed that they were reliable because i see all those old VW bugs and \"hippie vans\" (dont know what they\\'re called) still driving around.Don\\'t confuse durability with reliability.Also, those cars were more related to lawnmowers in their complexity, where as now they are more like aircraft.  >i see all those old VW bugs and \"hippie vans\" (dont know what they\\'re called) still driving around. In old days they had to stop along the road to adjust the valves if they drove their bug very far.  how about Saab\\'s?  Same boat...my uncle loves them, he put like 200k on a 900s, then got a newer 900 T, then got a 9-3 and just got another 9-3. They feel like little vaults. Both 900s got new manual transmissions, haven\\'t heard much about the 9-3s.  so i just got a copy of the new consumer reports *cough*notINhardCOPY *cough*. CR recommends the new passat. does very well in reliability. have a look.http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/5839/passatqm9.jpgcopy paste the link, tall picture, didnt want to clutter the forums.  Thanks for the post. Sounds like the Passat most people buy and can afford, the 2.0L, is \"much lower\" in reliability according to CR. That\\'s a shame.  Well i think you can say that for all kinds of cars. Usually the more expensive version of the car is more reliable. for the jetta CR says \"Reliability of the turbo and turbodiesel has been average.\" then it goes on to say the 2.5 liter i5 sucks.Both 2.0T\\'s in the A3 and A4 recieved \"average\" rating by CR.I mean here\\'s how i see it. People who buy base model cars sometimes dont keep their cars in as good condition as people who buy the more expensive version. Sort of like the Chvey v Buick example. If you know you spend 38k on your car you\\'re gonna baby it for a long time versus spending 20k on your car. See where i\\'m going with this? Honestly though, i believe if you take care of the car it\\'ll last, american, german, japanese, korean. If you take good care of it, it\\'ll take good care of you. Granted, japanese models seem to care less about getting cared for.edit: if you want me to look up ratings just post asking for them and i\\'ll put them up asap.  Posting the ratings won\\'t be necessary, but I actually carry a different viewpoint on the ratings. I feel like people who don\\'t have lots of money to drop on a new car will take care of the one they do have. My grandmother could buy and sell me, but doesn\\'t really take care of her car. I am in college, and in the career path I\\'m in don\\'t look forward to lots of money right off the bat, so I\\'m babying my car to make it last for many miles. An interesting note, the Camry V6 is more unreliable than the 4-cylinder. This is heavily due to the transmission issue though, I presume.  So the 2.0T is more reliable when installed in a Jetta than when it is installed in a Passat :confuse: .I\\'d need to see some proof that the more expensive versions are normally more reliable. I tend to think that the cars owned by younger buyers (eg. Jetta) get lower reliability because those buyers tend to be more unreliable than older folks in terms of how they maintain and drive them. To get back to the midsize category, the three that appear to have the most younger buyers are Altima, Mazda6, and Legacy. These have, respectively, 37%, 39%, and 46% in the 16-35 age range, according to JD Power.  What is a \"Legacy\"? :confuse:  Prior to the acquisition of our family\\'s present cars, Accord, Elantra, and Camry in that order, we drove (and, in one case, still drive) SAABs. I\\'ve never owned a new primarily GM-influenced SAAB, but rather the old Classic 900 SAABs - a 1985 900 (which is still a daily driver) and a 1987 900S. Built like a tank and very, very durable. Reliability? This depends on the owner, and preventive maintenance. In the case of our 1985 900, its power train (both engine and transmission) is still going strong, and does not burn any oil. The only thing that seems to keep me under the car is replacing the exhaust system - about once every 5 years, and front brake pads, otherwise it\\'s very reliable. No head gasket problems or timing chain problems either. And, FWIW, the parts cost on the SAAB are cheaper than our old Grand Caravan or any of the current Asian cars!  It\\'s a mid size sedan, of course...Subaru Legacy  SAAB parts cheaper than Dodge or Asian models??? I have little experience with SAABs other than a friend who had to replace a radiator, a front head-light and a key FOB on a year 2000 model. I don\\'t know exact prices, but the radiator cost 2-3 times as much as a Honda radiator, the headlight was outrageously expensive and the key FOB was something like $300.  If you read the article, it says the V6 Passat is recommended by CR. The 2.0T\\'s reliability is \"much lower\" than that of the V6, thus CR can\\'t recommend it yet. That is the same thing CR said in their April auto issue, and what I noted in my earlier post.  Yes, parts for either my 1985 900 8-valve or 1987 900S 16-valve are (or, were in the case of the 900S) far cheaper than my Dodge Grand Caravan or either of my Honda, Hyundai, or Toyota. You just have to know where to buy them, and that is certainly not the dealer.The best place by far to buy OEM SAAB parts is www.thesaabsite.com - they purchase OEM SAAB parts directly from the OEM supplier. For example, when buying a tail light lens from them, the box will say Hella (the OEM manufacturer) rather than SAAB. And, $131 for a new non-turbo CAT, as compared to over $600 from a SAAB dealer. But, you can also buy a Walker direct fit CAT from Advance Auto Parts for less than $75. The headlight for my \\'85 SAAB 900 is a standard halogen lamp assy. - not just the bulb - the entire headlamp. Its cost is around $11 from Wal-Mart or any of other discount auto supply houses. And, no fancy key FOB or keyless entry, just a plain old key which can be duplicated for around $10.When I first became a SAAB and Volvo owner, they were not perceived as they are today. This was before both marques went \"up market\" so to speak. Back in the \\'60s and \\'70s, buying either was analogous to buying a Chevy or Ford. Heck my \\'85 900 cost $12,100, including TTL in April 1985.  Interesting comparison of the midsize 2008 Honda Accord and 2008 Acura RL. Accord vs. RLAccord is actually larger both outside and inside.  Thats why those cars (altima, mazda 6,excluding the legacy) have lower reliabilities. Younger people drive their cars harder, they are under experienced and abuse their cars more. Now the Legacy is geared towards gear heads. Young gear heads know what they\\'re doing and when they buy a legacy they usually add mods to it etc. They know how to care for a car properly.I think reliability depends on the engine itself, how the car is driven, and how the car is cared for. Car\\'s like camry\\'s and accords are bought my family men/women. They drive the car normally. Cars like the Mazda 6 and Altima are a little more \"sporty\". In return younger age groups who tend to be insensible buy these cars and drive them like ferrari\\'s, thus causing it to get lower reliability ratings.  Honestly though, i believe if you take care of the car it\\'ll last, american, german, japanese, korean. If you take good care of it, it\\'ll take good care of you. Granted, japanese models seem to care less about getting cared for. I\\'d love for you to cancel that belief after driving a Chrysler made product around for awhile. Then you will say that perhaps American cars (or at least Chrysler cars) don\\'t care how much you care for them, they will screw you anyways.  Thats why those cars (altima, mazda 6,excluding the legacy) have lower reliabilities. Younger people drive their cars harder, they are under experienced and abuse their cars more.Really now???? :surprise:  I have to disagree with your assumptions, as I have real-life real-world experience that tells otherwise.My close friend got a new Geo Prizm (toyota corolla with Geo emblem vehicle) in the fall of 1994. No teenager ever drove a car harder or more abusive than him. He drove it harder than anyone has ever driven a Ferrari (which are probably mostly babied by old rich men). He drove it like a drag strip race car everywhere he went. He floored the thing everywhere he went. It wasn\\'t a particularly fast car, so flooring it everywhere he went wasn\\'t really going all that fast, but he\\'d definitely cruise along the highways at 90 MPH traffic allowing. This is far worse than your typical teen male driver, those who tend to drive their cars hard. However, the fault of an unreliable car is not in the way it is driven, but in the poor engineering, design, and build quality (how it was put together). No car should require care beyond that typically specified in the owner\\'s manual for regular maintenance. Now putting it in reverse while going 40 MPH forward is another case of abuse not relevant here. If you can do it, then the car should be able to handle it.Case in point, that Corolla clone was indestructible, bulletproof, and built like a tank, extremely well-built and put together. Nothing could bring it down, not even rear-ending a Mercedes at significant speed at 100K miles or so (because he got it repaired). It had an automatic transmission too.Either way, he reached 100,000 miles without having to spend a dime on unscheduled maintenance or repairs (not related to damage from minor dings, dents, skirmishes, fights, horseplay). The car was flawless. I believe he sold it to another friend who kept it for a long time after (lost track now). I purchased a domestic vehicle and babied it (in comparison to him) and maintained it supremely, but I was spending major dollars approximately quarterly (yes, that\\'s 4 times a year). I drove my 2003 Honda just as hard as my domestic from when I was younger (if not harder since the Honda was 10X faster and more powerful), and I didn\\'t have any problems outside of the known tranny issue. I didn\\'t feel like racing my Honda every weekend would have any detrimental affect on it. If it\\'s destiny was to go 400,000 miles, then it didn\\'t matter if it was done at 100 MPH or 50 MPH. The car simply showed no weaknesses.  >I think reliability depends on the engine itself, how the car is driven, and how the car is cared for. CR and JD Powers show there is little difference in the problem numbers among many cars these days. It goes back to how it\\'s cared for. Some have certain brands and do all the extra and scheduled service and then talk about how they have no problems. Of course not, it\\'s been well-serviced. People also have selective memories when they love their car or their brand.  The collision speed in a rear-end accident is measured by the relative speed (or speed differential) of the two vehicles.If you friend was driving 80 mph and read-ended a Mercedes driving 75 mph, the impact would be less than that of someone driving at 15 mph into a stationary object.  you\\'re absolutely right. i agree older models last longer, they were built better, thats what this whole discussion is about- how newer cars aren\\'t quite as good as the old ones (not technologically speaking). Today though, i think all cars are essentially the same. All cars, except a few, are built by mindless robots. Toyota and honda have managed to figure out how to coax the robots into making a better product.  on a slightly different note, check this out, scion tC has a \"v-4\"!!!!http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/4813/v4gv0.jpg This week\\'s newsweek. Gotta love typo\\'s.  I\\'d love for you to cancel that belief after driving a Chrysler made product around for awhile. Then you will say that perhaps American cars (or at least Chrysler cars) don\\'t care how much you care for them, they will screw you anyways.I certainly hope not. We have three Chrysler vehicles in our immediate family and we hope to get many more years of relatively trouble-free service from them. Our Chrysler loyalty dates back to 1998. My wife has been enjoying her \\'03 turbo Cruiser for 5 years. Our \\'99 Viper still gets my heart pounding the same way it did when I first brought it home. My Sebring I just purchased last month has been a total joy to drive around with all of its gadgets and things to play with. It\\'s covered by a lifetime powertrain warranty if something big should ever break.Finally, I bought my mom a 300C Hemi for Christmas two years ago. She\\'s been all smiles and no problems with it.Sorry to hear you\\'ve apparently had a bad experience.  Unfortunately, your experience with Chrysler is the exception and not the norm. My dad\\'s 87 Dodge Aries K car was a piece of dogpile. That car would break down without a single warning. That was our first and last Chrysler product. Poor quality is obe big reason ( the other being heavily dependent on trucks and SUV\\'s ) Chrysler is in deep trouble.  Good grief - a 1987 anything was crappy by today\\'s standards. You don\\'t think Dodge has improved any since 1987?  Unfortunately, your experience with Chrysler is the exception and not the norm. My dad\\'s 87 Dodge Aries K car was a piece of dogpile. That car would break down without a single warning. That was our first and last Chrysler product. Poor quality is obe big reason ( the other being heavily dependent on trucks and SUV\\'s ) Chrysler is in deep trouble.Our \\'83 Reliant sucked (although it was at least in part to a thirsty Mistubishi engine...doors falling off, door handles falling off, hubcaps flying off, bad roof welds, poor power windows, etc), but the \\'89 Grand Voyager was great. Three kids learned to drive in that van. It had 2 failures, both covered by 7/70 (trans, steering rack). The vehicle was traded w/150k or so. Chrysler and I are good, the redeemed themselves on that van. I had a 2007 Caravan as a rental in Hawaii and it felt more/less the same (not a bad thing to me). The dash was a bit of a disappointment w/mismatched colors and textures, but no worse than my \\'07 Accord.The \\'89 Mitsu Galant was fantastic, although it used a 2.0l FI motor vs a 60\\'s tech 2.6l carb truck motor like the Reliant.  People also have selective memories when they love their car or their brand.generally agree with this - for most of us a car is our 2nd biggest investment so therefore, human nature and our egos will want to think that we each made good decisions on a car we purchase. On the flip side of this is when a car really does perform below expectations and those memories will stick with us forever - there is nothing worse than having to make payments on a car that\\'s in the shop.That all said, statistics indicate that very few of us new car buyers keep a car long enough that we should have any real serious problems with it. If we limit reliability evaluations to the 3/4 years and 50/60k that most new car buyers/leasers keep any brand car then, of course, the \\'buyer\\' should really expect no mechanical difficulties and/or is covered by warranty (which the buyer obviously tends to forgive for some reason). A number of us, plan to and do tend to keep cars well into triple digits (200k or so) and therefore for 8 or 10 years, a point at which a manufacturer\\'s real ability to produce something betteris tested. First year or \\'initial\\' quality studies mean nothing IMO simply because it ought to be good and the folks that do these kind of \\'studies\\' are effectively paid for their results anyway. Show me what something does 10 years down the road ( well after the warranty expires). This means a lot. A favorable record in that regard is still heavily biased towards those mfgrs. with names ending in a vowel. If the buyer of an older car is looking for something for his kid\\'s first car - it will likely be a \"Japanese\" brand if reliability is a primary consideration, and conversely be an \"American\" brand if cost is a primary consideration. This has been true, for a reason, for maybe 20 years or so. And now magically I\\'m supposed to spend 25 large because I believe what somebody like JDP says? Show me a Fusion, for example, that is 10 years old and has held up as well as that mid 90s Accord or Camry and then maybe I\\'ll give it a fair shot at my 25 grand! So yes it will be several years before those \\'American\\' mfgrs. see any of my money, at which point, then I have to decide how important it is to me that I support our Canadian/Mexican/Chinese friends or some fellow Americans.  They sure hadn\\'t by 1996, when we gave Chrysler a second chance after our 1994 was a dealer-queen (it was there for 2 of the 8 months total we owned it because they couldn\\'t fix the problems). The 1996 needed a suspension rebuild and a transmission by 35k miles. We learned out lesson. TWICE bitten, four times as shy?  It doesn&#146;t matter to me if Chrysler have actually improved the reliability aspect of their cars, the fact is, the cars themselves leave a lot to be desired. While I have been impressed by the dynamics of 300 given the size of the car, fuel economy and engine refinement have sucked, and I don&#146;t feel the need to have Hemi to feel good about the engine, the 3.5/V6 that I have gotten in rental 300&#146;s can be a lot better.The lesser cars have trimmings and fittings that I can&#146;t stand inside. Even when looked from outside. My last extended experience with a (2007) Stratus was not a good one. I drove it for about 3000 miles, with virtually all of it on freeway. 26-27 mpg was it, while the engine lacked passing power, refinement and the car was terrible handling cross winds at higher speeds. Just a few hundred miles later, I was repenting having not gone for Accord, which would have been the first time I had managed to spot one, but didn&#146;t go to save $10/day as Avis considered it an upgrade over Stratus. That was to save me about $50 over five days. But with that fuel economy in Stratus, and given that my experience with Accord has always gotten 32-33 mpg under those situations, the Honda would have made up for the premium. Given the choices again, I know it won&#146;t be the Dodge, much less when it comes to actually buying one.I am not surprised at all Chrysler has become a huge player in rental fleets. I do like their minivans though, but again, they go against two excellent ones: Odyssey and Sienna.  a 1987 anything was crappy by today\\'s standards - given the \\'by today\\'s standards\\' caveat perhaps - but this is also a very relative thing. That Dodge was (and maybe still is) a whole lot less then what the \\'Japanese\\' were producing at the time. It is this fact that \\'gave\\' the domestic car market to the Japanese in the mid late 80s and early 90s.  Perhaps a better way to look at the situation would be, to list three reasons to choose a new Chrysler Sebring over Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, Ford Fusion, Saturn Aura or Hyundai Sonata. In other words, what makes that car better than these others?  The only point was that you can\\'t judge a 2008 vehicle by what a company made in 1987 or even 1996. I was not implying anything about current Chrysler reliability or desirability.  I\\'m not implying anything necessarily about the Sebring either, but what I did say is that whatever quality differences there are, are certainly relative to those cars available at same time whether that vintage be 2008 or 1987. If the market perceives the current Sebring to have the same quality related issues relative to let\\'s say an Accord, then nothing has really changed because back in 87 that was true comparing a \\'K\\' car to an Accord. And many contend that the \\'K\\' (and the minivan takeoff of the \\'K\\') is largely what \\'saved\\' Chrysler back then, and they sold Camcord-esque numbers of them (300-400000/year). But the quality difference even back then is why the American mfgrs. \\'lost\\' the sedan business, it wasn\\'t because the Japanese cars were any cheaper, they were simply better. The fact that an \\'87 car from any mfgr. is not as good as a 2008 version is a tribute largely to technology and doesn\\'t really have anything to do with Chrysler, in this case, improving their cars - of course, they have - but so has everybody else.  Perhaps a better way to look at the situation would be, to list three reasons to choose a new Chrysler Sebring over Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, Ford Fusion, Saturn Aura or Hyundai Sonata. In other words, what makes that car better than these others?I\\'ll be glad to. I just bought a 3.5L Sebring Limited sedan last month. Before I bought it I test drove a 2.7L Sebring, I sat in a Camry and I also test drove a 3.0L AWD Fusion. I never made it down the road to the Saturn dealer because after I drove the Sebring I knew that\\'s what I wanted.I was not impressed at all with the interior of the Camry and taking one for a test drive would have just been a waste of time.I wasn\\'t happy after my original test drive of the 2.7L Sebring. The 3.5L, with its 6-speed autostick, changed my mind.The 3.0L AWD Fusion I drove had decent performance but it had a ho-hum interior, not much better than the Camry. Plus, there was just too much chrome on the front end for me to like.The Sebring I drove and ended up buying had just about everything I could ever want - MyGIG GPS navigation, 20GB HD for storing up to 1,600 songs plus photos. UConnect hands-free voice commands with bluetooth to connect with my cell phone, Sirius satellite radio with real-time traffic interface, front seat DVD player and more. I\\'m a gadget guy and all this was sort of like a playground on wheels. I even noticed things like the nice, solid sound and feel the door made when closing.Okay, in answer to your question...1. It had what I wanted. The others I looked at didn\\'t.2. My family has been happy overall with Chrysler vehicles and I decided to finally give them a try for my personal vehicle.3. I know some people in the auto business and I was able to get an employee discount, which saved me over $5,500 off the $30,000 MSRP, including a $1,000 rebate.  Unfortunately, your experience with Chrysler is the exception and not the norm. My dad\\'s 87 Dodge Aries K car was a piece of dogpile.As others have already pointed out, things have changed a lot in two decades. I could write a book about the problems I had with an import Isuzu Opel I had back in the 1980s.  Chrysler interior...Yikes!!!  I\\'m a gadget guy and all this was sort of like a playground on wheels.You\\'ve demonstrated that there\\'s lots of different reasons for why someone buys a particular car. Having a \"playground on wheels\" would never make my Top 10 or even Top 20 reasons for buying a car, but that\\'s why everyone has to evaluate cars based on their criteria and not others\\'. One thing Chrysler appears to have done with the Sebring is attack a niche market for people who like lots of electronic entertainment features in their sedans. Have fun with them!  One thing Chrysler appears to have done with the Sebring is attack a niche market for people who like lots of electronic entertainment features in their sedans.What about the Fusion with Sync? I thought the Chrysler only had a hard drive for music - does it do more than that?  Personally i like cars that are simple. It should be car, radio, GOOD A/C, comfy seats, and maps. I dont care for the Nav system because i live in a suburb, i know all my streets. Put all of that in a reliable package with good worksmanship and i\\'m a happy camper.  It looks like the Sebring\\'s hard drive can do more than play music. And, does the Fusion have a front-seat DVD player?  Yes, I would rather have a car that itself is entertaining rather than its media systems providing the entertainment. And any need I had for a nav system has just been satisfied--my company just gave me a cell phone with built-in GPS navigation. Works in ANY car--even if I\\'m just a passenger.   Good grief - a 1987 anything was crappy by today\\'s standards. You don\\'t think Dodge has improved any since 1987? Absolutely not. Chrysler is the exact same company it was 10, 20, and 30 years ago; that being a company that makes nothing but junk lemon cars :lemon: I see no indication that they have ever improved on anything.  Any credibility you had before just went out the window with that blanket statement. I say this, and my family has been burned by Chrysler and I drive a Honda. Your statement is still outrageous.  Man I see why you needed those great Audi seats, your back must hurt from that huge chip you carry on your shoulder. :P  \"Any credibility you had....\" It was nil anyhow and, if possible, is now less than ZERO..0...nada...zippo.  This is not a discussion about other members - focus on the cars, please.  Ok, I checked out the MyGig. It does store music on the hard drive but it doesn\\'t interface with MP3 players except through a generic audio jack - no mp3 player control and no voice control. No bluetooth phone interface. And it does play DVDs on the built in screen - but only while you\\'re parked. How many people watch DVDs while parked in their car and sitting in the front seat?  And it does play DVDs on the built in screen - but only while you\\'re parked. How many people watch DVDs while parked in their car and sitting in the front seat?How many drivers do you want watching TV while they are driving? or are you thinking about having the video sent to the rear screens?  Well, not me. But apparently it was an important feature for at least one buyer, as he specifically mentioned it. I have a 9\" portable DVD player that I use when we go on trips of over a couple of hours with the kids (which isn\\'t that often), and play it back through the stereo system via a wireless connector. The whole rig including the connector cost less than $100. That\\'s one of the reasons I have trouble justifying paying a premium for these features to be built into a car. That Sebring mentioned earlier listed for $30k and even with a huge special discount was just under $25k before T&L. You can get a very nice Accord or Camry for $25k, or even something bigger like a Taurus or Azera.  No, I don\\'t want the driver watching anything except the road. I was just indicating that I didn\\'t see that as a really useful feature.  Or for 25k, you could get a v-6 mazda6 with alloys, side airbags, a/c, cc, and have 8k in your pocket (just saw an ad in the paper for a 07 Mazda6 as described above for 17k - it was one of those ads that says one only, so I wonder how real it is). It was at a new Mazda dealership though, so I wonder if they are just trying to buy some market share right now... but still a great deal if you can find it!  Yes, there are many deals available for less than $25k. I was pointing out what $25k could buy instead of a Sebring with lots of electronic gear.I wonder if that one-only Mazda6 was a demo?  It seems people now buying cars to get hard drive instead of, to drive the car. That said, since I\\'m wary of anything but solid state when it comes to storage in a hostile environment, are these hard drives solid state?After having lost a lot of data (which was recovered at a cost) to a damaged micro-drive in my digital camera, I\\'ve been wary of going that route again. No more micro-drives... compact flash works better. With proliferation of HDD based systems, I\\'m thinking along the same lines, especially in cars where extreme heat, cold and bumps could play a major role in terms of reliability/durability over the life of a car.  I just don\\'t understand why you want that much electronic storage in a car. You have everything at home, everything on your iPod, everything at work...how many places do you need to capture the same information?Just let me plug my stupid iPod in and play it and control it. Design an interface to control the iPod in a vehicle that doesn\\'t suck. I don\\'t want to re-copy all my cd\\'s in 50 places, especially if I already have a portable tool I can use.  I don\\'t, but apparently a lot of people couldn\\'t live without HDD in their cars. Unless I\\'m sure about their long term durability in something like a car, I certainly don\\'t want them in my car. I\\'m perfectly happy with 6-disc changers in my cars though. I may have replaced one or two DVD audio discs in my TL over last year. Those, combined with FM/XM seem more than enough.I\\'ve one at home but have not used i-Pod in my car yet.  Just let me plug my stupid iPod in and play it and control it. Design an interface to control the iPod in a vehicle that doesn\\'t suck.Is there something wrong with the Sync iPod interface?  Mazda has it. A fully integrated iPod cable designed by Apple for Mazda products.  lets hop on the topic of the azera. Why buy an azera over....a passat or a camry or an accord, especially the accord since its in the same class as the azera.  Price v. Features!!!The Azera presents a pretty great value as far as bang for the buck is concerned.  Just let me plug my stupid iPod in and play it and control it. Design an interface to control the iPod in a vehicle that doesn\\'t suck.Is there something wrong with the Sync iPod interface?I haven\\'t gotten to play with it yet, but as far as I can tell, it is exactly what I am talking about. It interfaces with devices people already have, doesn\\'t require them to do anything differently (like dump a bunch of songs on a hard drive) and provides a better in-vehicle interface.  Correct. You can select songs for playback by playlist or song title or artist via voice command. Can\\'t get much easier than that. And it doesn\\'t require any additional wires or connectors. And it works on multiple MP3 players, not just iPods.And new devices will also be supported via software upgrade.  So looks like Ford is offering a discount to all the people in S. Cal who had their cars burned up in the recent fires. During the fire, they even donated 11 super duty trucks to help with the effort. Yeah the cynic in me says nice PR move, but to those who have lost a lot, it could make a real difference to them. So even if it is just a PR move, kudos for Ford for going further than other car companies to help out people in need. discounts for fire victimsOf course, I wouldn\\'t buy a car based on how generous a company was to people in need, but it is a nice gesture deserving of praise.  That is a nice gesture and also smart marketing for Ford. They realize lots of people will need to replace their cars. This is not a new idea, it\\'s been done before after, for example, hurricanes, but a good move by Ford. I expect other carmakers will follow suit.  Interesting review from the Detroit Free Press on the Accord EX. To me it seems as if the writer was going out of his way to find something to justify the overall theme of \"the Accord no longer leads the mid-sized pack.\" And he never does explain why he thinks other mid-sizers, and which ones, are now ahead of the Accord, and why the Accord merits only an \"above average\" rating, and an iffy one at that. Does he really think the new Malibu (not yet available), Fusion, Mazda6, Aura, and Camry are all superior to the Accord, which is what he implies with his closing remarks?His comments about interior flaws do reflect the recent discussion here about interior quality slipping in general.http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071025/COL14/710250367/1015/BU- SINESS01  The fact that he is from Detroit explains everything, at least to me. This is exactly what people in Detroit want to here.  Actually the writer in question is not an import basher. If anything he has a tendency to deride the domestics more often than not when they do not measure up. He is more performance orientated in his choice of favored vehicles. Long time Freep reader.  The fact that he is from Detroit explains everything, at least to me. This is exactly what people in Detroit want to here. Read more of Mark\\'s reviews and you will discover he is an equal opportunity basher.For people with a strong anti-detroit bias, I can understand how your conclusion could be reached.  Yes, he is negative against GM also.Discussion Toyota\\'s problemsPriceless comments:What do you think of the J.D. Power surveys?\" another executive asked me last week, regarding the quality rankings. \"They\\'re making us crazy\" because Toyota\\'s top models don\\'t always finish on top these days.\"We get downgraded because of little things like a squeak or a loose piece. It\\'s not like we had a transmission failure.\"He went on to say that the company felt Consumer Reports magazine treats it more fairly. Of course, that was a couple of days before the magazine downgraded Toyota for problems ranging from squeaks and rattles to suspension and transmission faults.  is it built as well as the accord? will it be as reliable? those are the questions what hold me from even test driving one. Because, generally all new cars are gonna run better than my 14 year old one.  Ok, I checked out the MyGig. It does store music on the hard drive but it doesn\\'t interface with MP3 players except through a generic audio jack - no mp3 player control and no voice control. No bluetooth phone interface. And it does play DVDs on the built in screen - but only while you\\'re parked. How many people watch DVDs while parked in their car and sitting in the front seat?My Sebring does have a bluetooth interface with my cell phone. I don\\'t know if it was part of the MyGIG package or some other option but as soon as I turn the car on it connects. The hands-free interface lets me use voice commands to control the phone, GPS, radio and possibly the DVD player, although I have yet to watch a movie on it.Also, the factory setting will not let you watch a front seat movie while in motion but there is already one hardware hack to get around it, available on the Internet. I wouldn\\'t ever watch a movie while driving but it would be a great feature whenever my wife and I travel.One of the options that you can get with MyGIG that mine didn\\'t come with is a backup camera that automatically switches to the camera display when you shift into reverse. I\\'d like to add that to mine but I\\'m waiting the results of a Nitro owner who is adding a backup camera display to his MyGIG. The small camera attaches to the license plate frame. I\\'ve seen them on eBay.One owner talked about the ultimate setup being to have an IR camera for the front view and a switchable display signal to send to the MyGIG screen for night stealth driving. Hmm...   Last night I noticed something unusual in the interior of my 2007 Accord. Directly in between the front seats is a center console with a cloth covering, which serves as an armrest (the whole top slides back and forth to allow the driver to adjust the position of the armrest). Well, in my car, the cloth covering has pulled out in the front. I\\'m going to see if I can get a picture of this and post it later. The car has 10,800 miles. I have no other interior-related complaints, save for a very slightly misaligned glove box.  Edmunds.com has posted their first review of the 2008 Malibu, link on the home page. They tested the top-of-the-line LTZ with the V6 engine, but they must have driven other trims too because they had comments on the I4. Overall a positive review, although they didn\\'t like the steering, or the 4AT in the I4.The base Malibu looks like a nice package for only $19,995, especially this spring when the 4AT is upgraded to a 6AT. That undercuts Accord, Altima, and Camry and is in the Sonata\\'s ballpark, but with some unique features such as OnStar and, soon, the 6AT. But not ESC.Which reminds me, I noticed at least one gaffe in the review:Front and rear head curtain side-impact bags and front-seat-mounted thorax bags are standard, along with dual-stage front bags. Standard ABS and traction control along with electronic stability control (standard on the Malibu LT and Malibu LTZ models) are there to prevent impromptu testing of any of those airbags.There isn\\'t a competitor that offers a better allotment of standard safety features.Wrong. Both Accord and Sonata offer all of these features on every trim; Malibu doesn\\'t offer ESC on the base trim. Now, if they toss in OnStar as a safety feature, then perhaps the statement is true. But they didn\\'t. Also no mention of whether the Malibu has active front head restraints, which many mid-sized cars including Accord and Sonata have.  The new Malibu appears to be a pretty decent car. The last piece of the puzzle is in place for the onslaught of comparison tests to commence. Among the Camry, Malibu, Aura and Accord I predict the Accord to take the number one spot and the Camry to be last in most of them. Hey, the Camry is still the sales champ.  Based on Edmunds.com\\'s review of the Malibu and reviews (and my own drive) of the Accord, I don\\'t think it\\'s out of the question for 1-2 comparos to put the Malibu at the top. But C/D will probably have the Accord at the top (and Camry near the bottom), while MT might tend to put the Malibu at the top--and make it their COTY, since the new Malibu is a significant car and that\\'s what MT\\'s COTY award measures.I think 2008 is the year the Camry will lose the sales lead to Accord, unless Toyota dumps a lot of Camrys into fleets.  >unless Toyota dumps a lot of Camrys into fleetsToyo can\\'t do that after so many people have criticized GM for selling cars to fleets all these years, ridiculed GM, in fact.  Sure they can. They already sell lots of Camrys to fleets. I think it depends on how badly Toyota wants to hang onto the #1 sales position for cars. They are already undercutting Honda big time on leases, e.g. Camry LE for $184/month vs. $259/month for the Accord LX, with about the same money out of pocket. The new Malibu will take some mid-sized sales away from others too. So if Toyota wants to maintain the Camry\\'s strong sales, it may have to increase fleet sales.  >already sell lots of Camrys to fleetsThey should be selling them to individuals. That dilutes the value of the brand and the car to sell them to fleets. And they\\'re dumping them in leases. That means in two years those used cars won\\'t be worth anything!  Well, so much for the vaunted Camry resale value then!   Toyota has consistently put about 14% units of Camry in fleet sales over last ten years or so. I\\'m not sure about how many went to fleet before that. That makes for an additional 60K in sales. So, while a relatively big number when compared to companies that don\\'t do fleet much (Honda has traditionally limited itself to 2% or so), it isn\\'t, when you consider 14% might be on the lower side of the average.I think Chrysler is the brand that is suffering from it the most. In fact, I was shocked to learn that 79.4% of Avenger went to fleet (based on mid-year registrations, not over a full year). There seems to be a pretty long list of vehicles with more than a third of their sales going towards fleet. Here are some midsizers that top the list (w/minimum projected annual sales of 40K units)Chrysler Sebring 63.50%Chevrolet Malibu 58.80%Dodge Charger 56.20%Chevrolet Impala 53.90%Kia Optima 52.80%Chrysler 300 44.00%Ford Five Hundred 43.10%Mazda6 42.70%Pontiac G6 36.20%Now with these cars, fleet sales really becomes an issue. Most of them have less than half making it to a private owner. When fleet returns happen, these cars can\\'t hold value, and resale suffers. For Camry and Altima (typically 16-18%), it is much less of an issue, even though they sell in higher volumes than most of these.  Do you happen to have info on the % of Sonata sales that are to fleets? I think it was about a year ago that Hyundai said it was reducing fleet sales.  Based on Edmunds.com\\'s review of the Malibu and reviews (and my own drive) of the Accord, I don\\'t think it\\'s out of the question for 1-2 comparos to put the Malibu at the top.If the author of the Malibu preview drive is any indication of how the rest of the editors feel then the Accord will take #1 spot at Edmunds.  The fleet numbers are based on half year registrations (Oct-Mar). For 2007, 27.6% of the total sales of Sonata went towards fleet. A year before that, it was 50.2%.In number of units, 15K units of Sonata out of 54K sold went to fleet in first half of 2007. Over the same period a year before that, it was 42.5K units of 84.6K units sold.So, Hyundai did reduce fleet sales from 42.5K units to 14.9K units going from 2006 to 2007. The retail sales was about the same, dipping slightly from 42.1K in 2006 to 38.9K in 2007 (same period).  Yes, I agree. Unless... they do one of those \"what can you get for $XXk\" comparos again and it happens to be a Malibu LT I4 with the 6-speed AT vs. the Accord LX. That could get interesting.  I don\\'t see a major price advantage on Malibu actually. It is priced in the same price range as the Accord.  There\\'s now a lot of good choices in this segment even if you would just limit yourself to the domestic name plates. With only Chrysler being left out of the party in my humble opinion. And even then it\\'s not like you\\'re being punished for getting a Sebring.  - Malibu LS I4 AT, $19,995 including destination charge.- Accord LX I4 AT, $21,795 including destination charge.I don\\'t know about you, but $1800 is a significant chunk of change to me.  I would feel punished if I had to drive a Sebring every day. :sick:  You apparently have not driven the redesigned 07 or 08 Sebring with the 3.5L 6-speed autostick and all the options lately.It\\'s a joy to drive. I usually go out during my lunch break just to sit in it and play. I never knew I could drive to Disneyworld from St. Louis without using any freeways until now.  I am glad you enjoy your car. Personally I don\\'t buy a car to use its electronics to find out that I could drive from St. Louis to Disneyland without using any freeways, but as I\\'ve noted before, each of us has his/her own criteria for buying a car. If I had to look at the exterior and interior of the Sebring every day, I would not have a good feeling. A car I own has to be one for which I could live with its looks for a long time. The Sebring isn\\'t one of those cars for me.  map out a trip to Wallyworld just like Clark Griswald took in National Lampoon\\'s Vacation. Only you\\'re not gonna be starting from Chicago you\\'ll start from St.Louis. Remember to stop at the Grand Canyon(it really is not to be missed...Clark dissed it in the movie).Would the Chrysler Sebring be comfortable all the way to Los Angeles from St.Louis?I like the new \\'08 Bu from Chevrolet, as far as looks go anyways. I was looking at it on the net back at the beginning of this year but was turned off when Chevy announced that they would not sell any with manual tranny\\'s.Then I bought a 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS with a CVT automatic anyway! Really, the \\'08 Bu is a tad big for my tastes. The Lancer GTS is just right for my wife and I.  That\\'s the sound of the last almost full-page of posts disappearing. Let me suggest to all participants that if you want to continue to be a part of this conversation that you keep your posts on topic. Posts about other participants are out of bounds period. Posts about minivans, SUVs, manufacturers in general, etc., do not belong here. We are here to discuss midsize sedans and that\\'s all.Every one of you who has had a post removed just now knows those things so let\\'s stop and think a minute before making an inappropriate post. If you feel like a post is out of line, you have two choices - ignore it or email me and ask me to look at it. Jumping on the poster is not one of your options.  It won\\'t be, if you consider that you don\\'t get a few things in the Malibu that you do in Accord. You did make a point about 6AT earlier, so why doesn\\'t Accord have an edge on Malibu until that happens? This, besides the fact that you have to move up to LT trim to get stability control. Both are points that you often use to compare \"value\".And we are not talking long term ownership costs here, right?  Which trim lines of the Accord offer OnStar as standard equipment? Or if not standard, what is the cost of the OnStar option?If you require stability control on a car to consider it a good value, how about this:Malibu LT I4 AT with moonroof: $21,755Accord EX I4 AT (least expensive Accord with a moonroof): $24,495Until early next year, the Accord has one more cog in its AT that comes with the I4. But then the Malibu will take the lead there with its 6AT.  Accord\\'s don\\'t have OnStar as that is a GM service. But if you meant the Mailbu, it\\'s standard from LS on up.  No, I meant the Accord. There was a comment that the Accord has features the Malibu doesn\\'t have. It seems that is true the other way around also.  I read the Edmunds.com review of the 08 Malibu. These are just a few of the areas where the reviewer said the Malibu came up a little short, when compared to the Accord (and some other competitors). Power (I4 and V6), fuel economy, interior, and steering feel. Not huge advantages, but advantages none the less. A couple I would have mentioned are the likelyhood of better reliability and resale value.  It would be helpful to avoid the sarcasm and just make the point directly.  Excuse me, but my post was not intended as sarcasm. I am sorry you saw it that way. It was, however, an indirect way of noting that the Malibu has features that the Accord does not.  I am glad you enjoy your car. Personally I don\\'t buy a car to use its electronics to find out that I could drive from St. Louis to Disneyland without using any freewaysOh, I think you already knew that was just one of many examples of the entertaining things it can do. Besides, it was DisneyWORLD. I had a choice of vehicles to take to work today. There was Scarlett the red Sebring, Shirley the blue/black Trek bicycle (I ride a lot) and Elvira the black Viper. I know many people would not give up a chance to drive a Viper around but Scarlett the Sebring got the call. She\\'s just so much darn fun in her own way.  Since fantasy comparisons are fine and dandy in these forums, now that you couldn\\'t make a point against Accord LX, you want to add moonroof, eh?I don\\'t know about you, but I have seen this as a cyclical process. The debate pops up every five years. Malibu started with a bang ten years ago, even louder five years ago. And now, there is yet another.The way you see value is not the way everybody else does. If I were to bet on value, my pick would on Accord LX/LX-P over Malibu LS/LT. There is a whole lot to cars than trying to find a feature or two that might be missing in one. One of the points you have made is with the assumption that Malibu will have 6AT (if I asked you, what advantage it afforded, we will be going back to a discussion that you couldn\\'t digest earlier). So, why are you ignoring that it has 4AT right now? And if GM is indeed planning to put 6AT in couple of months which will drastically transform the car, as you seem to believe, then shouldn\\'t we pity anybody who buys the Malibu today?The only thing we could agree upon, perhaps, is that you can\\'t prove anything until tested against time. Give them 2-3 years, and we might be discussion \"upgrades\" necessary with next generation.  Backy...you didnt really drive from St Louis to DW using back roads...did you?So how do you like Sebring?Good mileage?  There\\'s a pretty good review of the 08 Malibu on the 2008 Chevy Malibu forum, message 545 for those who might be interested. Looks like the LTZ model on the four cylinder will be the first to get the six speed auto, with the other trim levels to follow thereafter.  Actually, \"value\" is as subjective of an opinion as is \"color\" - everyone is entitled to his or her own definition which includes you, backy and everyone else here. No need for us all to agree, otherwise why would so many choices be available?!   I agree with your opinion. And didn\\'t think challenging another\\'s was the point but that what one sees as value isn\\'t that for another.  So, why are you ignoring that it has 4AT right now? And if GM is indeed planning to put 6AT in couple of months which will drastically transform the car, as you seem to believe, then shouldn\\'t we pity anybody who buys the Malibu today? I didn\\'t ignore that the Malibu has a 4AT on the I4 right now--I was very clear that it has one, and actually mentioned it more than once in this discussion. And I never said that a 6AT will \"drastically transform the car.\" We can have a much better dialogue about these cars if we don\\'t put words on each other\\'s fingers and not take (inaccruate) stabs at what other people say. Agreed?  Its not taking stabs, I\\'m expecting consistency in arguments. It got worse because instead of sticking with the original argument (LS versus LX), you changed it to now compare LT w/moonroof to EX. I could have just as well taken it further, and we get nowhere.If you can make a case for value based on initial price versus features with one trim, you should be able to do so without having to change the argument.  So how do you like Sebring?Good mileage? Well, you can see from my replies to Backy how much I like it. The mileage is a little low but it\\'s within tolerable limits. The two times I\\'ve actually checked it I calculated 20.7 and 20.8 mpg combined city/highway. The in-dash display shows it to be about 1 mpg less than that but I like to figure it the old fashioned way.I\\'m looking forward to testing it on a long highway cruise someday. Maybe I\\'ll drive down to DisneyWORLD, although I only know how to get there by not taking the freeway.   Do you also have average mph display to go with average mpg? If you do, could you post that as well when you do reset the trip computer?Based on my experience, average mph is a big factor in determining observed fuel economy. My previous experience with Chrysler 3.5/V6 was in 2007 300, that I had as a rental in Arizona. It got a decent 26-27 mpg (90% highway) in that car.  It got worse because instead of sticking with the original argument (LS versus LX), you changed it to now compare LT w/moonroof to EX.Uh, you were the one who asked to change the comparison. You noted that the Malibu LS doesn\\'t have stability control and the Accord LX does. Even though the Malibu has features the Accord doesn\\'t, I went ahead and took your suggestion to compare a Malibu with stability control to the Accord. But I noticed the Malibu LT has 17\" wheels, which is what the Accord EX has. So to make the price comparison more fair to the Accord, I added a moonroof to the Malibu. So, what is the big deal with that?  It\\'s funny how passionate some people are about their FWD family sedans. I\\'m not knocking everyone who posts here; I just find it amusing how some people can actually be Family Sedan Snobs.If you want to be a car snob, at least buy a pre-owned BMW or something comparable.Fact is: family sedans are appliances. For those who are unbiased and willing to test drive all of them, you will find very little difference between Brand X and Brand Y.  It might be interesting to re-visit discussion from the beginning of time. Your original post on the topic:&#147;Yes, I agree. Unless... they do one of those \"what can you get for $XXk\" comparos again and it happens to be a Malibu LT I4 with the 6-speed AT vs. the Accord LX. That could get interesting.&#148;To which I responded:&#147;I don\\'t see a major price advantage on Malibu actually. It is priced in the same price range as the Accord.&#148;This is where hell broke loose. You had started with LT, went back to LS to quote the lowest price possible then went back to LT w/moon roof option added to ensure you weren&#146;t getting left behind in feature list. Regardless of where you go, my point still stands... Malibu is pretty close in pricing to Accord.To be more realistic, let us leave it to the market to decide &#147;value&#148;, shall we?PS. It is interesting that you put greater value to 17&#148; rims. Give me 16&#148; rims, unless it happens to be a sport tuned model that demands a lower profile tire. Otherwise, those things are not only going to add to the cost of tires during every replacement but also add about 40 lb to the unsprung weight of the car. I have argued about this endlessly in some Accord related forums. I\\'ve went far enough to say that Honda has gone overboard with wheel sizes even in Civic LX which uses the same size wheels as the much more heavier, performance oriented and powerful BMW 3-series. Now one can get a Civic Si with rim size that is larger than was ever offered in Acura NSX.There are a lot more ways to appreciate &#147;value&#148; than the initial price tag.  Fact is: family sedans are appliances. For those who are unbiased and willing to test drive all of them, you will find very little difference between Brand X and Brand Y.Your comments, Autokritiker, are sure to rankle some posters on this thread but I for one happen to agree with you. My wife and I enjoy our 2007 SEL AWD Ford Fusion immensely but it is, after all, a four-door sedan, albeit it a very nice one.The four-door sedan has come a long way in the last half century but mostly all manufacturers these days offer competitive products: There is not a great deal of difference between Brand X and Brand Y, in my book.  I agree there are is more to value than original price tag. But I don\\'t know why you seem to be so upset at my attempts to compare prices of like-trim Malibus and Accords, in reply to your statement, \"It is priced in the same price range as the Accord.\"First, I compared the price of the base trim Malibu with AT to the base trim Accord with AT. You objected because the base Malibu doesn\\'t have stability control and the base Accord does. So to accomodate your complaint, I compared the up-level Malibu LT, which has stability control, to the up-level Accord EX. And I added a moonroof to the Malibu since that is something the Accord EX has. I guess you didn\\'t like that either. Is it that you don\\'t like the fact that the new Malibu is significantly less expensive than the Accord? If you want to think of a difference of $1800-$2800 as \"close to\", that\\'s fine with me. We\\'ll just have to disagree on that. As we do on the value of larger rims/tires. Or the value of a 60/40 split rear seat, which is standard on the Malibu but not available on the Accord. Or the value of OnStar, which is standard on the Malibu but not available on the Accord.You define value the way you want, but others may disagree.  You define value the way you want, but others may disagree. You stole my words from a previous post. I don\\'t know why you seem to be so upset at my attempts to compare prices of like-trim Malibus and Accords, in reply to your statement, \"It is priced in the same price range as the Accord.\"I don\\'t know about you, but when someone responds to my post, as long as it doesn\\'t include \"you\" in it (addressed to me), I see no reason for anything personal but a discussion around the topic on hand. A response isn\\'t an indicator of being upset with someone.If you want to think of a difference of $1800-$2800 as \"close to\", that\\'s fine with me.Ok... :confuse:When I got my Accord, I was able to negotiate the price to about $1800 below MSRP, basically getting a $23K Accord for a little over $21K while having a $25K budget. Would that be possible if $1800 weren\\'t \"close\"? If automakers are capable of giving up to $4K-5K off MSRP, you\\'re questioning \"closeness\" of about half that amount here!  > $1800 below MSRP, basically getting a $23K Accord for a little over $21K $4K-5K off MSRP,Wow.  We\\'ve come a long way from the 03 Accord era when some people \\'informed\\' :sick: me that Honda never had to have discounts, incentives, rebates, etc.   I\\'m not sure what your experience at getting a discount off MSRP on an Accord (not a 2008, right?) has to do with what we were discussing. Do you think that Chevy doesn\\'t discount the Malibu? IMO, I think big discounts on both the 2008 Accord and Malibu will be hard to come by for awhile. But they\\'ll come. The market is too competitive for anyone to sell a mid-sized family sedan at MSRP in any volume, for any length of time.  The idea is to provide a perspective on how big (or small) the price difference is. Prices haven\\'t changed much over last ten years, so the argument about old versus new is mute.  A changing market calls for changing business practices, no?With Toyota flooding the market with incentive-laden Camrys (Camries?), Honda had to do something to keep its share of the market from its closest competitor, what is quickly beomcing the McDonald\\'s of the car industry, Toyota.  Did you mean \"moot\"?Since people will be buying 2008 models as new cars now, I think it\\'s appropriate to focus on those when comparing prices of the mid-sized sedans, not models from 10 years ago.I think we\\'ve established the MSRP price difference between the Accord and Malibu is roughly $2000-3000, at least for the I4 models. I haven\\'t looked at the V6 pricing yet; I\\'ll leave that to you or someone else to do the comparison. Personally, I think the Malibu is priced right where it needs to be--still near the lower end of the market, but more than the old Malibu--now called the \"Malibu Classic\". Want a burger and fries with that?   I was through the local Honda dealer\\'s lot Sunday browsing the used cars. There were hoards of Accords; very few used cars.  With upgraded 2.4 177hp) and 3.3 V6 cylinder(260hp) engines with enhanced fuel economy, revised suspension, standard 5 and 6 speed trannies and improved interior, Hyundai is addressing flat Sonata sales. I\\'m not sure the exterior is as crisp and clean. The new design, both interior and exterior has that \\'Lexus knock-off\\' look. Interior is much improved! These figures come from infor from the Hyundai Dealer Convention.http://forums.subdriven.com/zerothread?id=3522630&page=2http://forums.subdriven.com/zerothread?id=3522630&page=1  New Sonata Video just released displaying enhancements to the 2009 Sonata.http://www.hyundai-motor.com/index.html  Sorry, my Korean is a bit rusty. Do you have a direct link?  Hmm. The exterior looks worse IMO. I liked the way it looked before.As for the interior, MUCH better IMO. But only with the nav. The non-nav interior pick has something that looks out of place under the main CP where the radio is however. Anyone know what that is and why they put it in such a place? I don\\'t like things that look tacked on like that at all.That being said, the exterior alone would probably keep me from buying one now. Add the tacked on looking thing under the CP, because I wouldn\\'t want a nav system, and Hyundai would have a hard time selling me one of these. I\\'ll reserve final judgement until I see one though.  Story here.40+ mpg? Very impressive!Being that we\\'re now an SUV/CUV family I\\'d really like to see what Honda puts in their\\'s for 2009 as that\\'s when we\\'ll need a new one.  If that\\'s the same photo that has been floating around the net, the DIN-sized electronics device lower in the center stack that looks out of place is a taxi meter. This is a shot of a Korean taxi version.I agree on the exterior - not as clean as the original. Give me the current exterior, and the new interior.  I completely agree with backy on this... the Malibu seems to be a very good buy compared to the Accord and will likely be available for several thousands less than an Accord. Personally, I\\'m happy midsized sedans continue to improve as if offers consumers more choices. In years past, I doubt I would have considered anything from ford, saturn, or chevy, but now I\\'d have to agree with others on this forum that they are making some very good cars. I\\'ve owned 2 Accords in the past and they served me well... now that most cars in this segment are very reliable, it\\'s refreshing that I\\'m not married to a brand anymore and am willing to consider other options.  Keep in mind these are photos of the Korean market Sonata. The exterior, including grille and wheels, of the current home market Sonata are different than what we have here (interior is pretty much the same, except they have nav already). That is clear from the video posted above. So it\\'s possible what we are seeing in these photos is not quite what we\\'ll get here next spring. I hope we get the new interior but not the new grille and wheels--a little too fussy for my taste.  Nice!! 2.4L I4 177; 3.3L V6 260 and with improved fuel economy, that\\'s getting efficient.The interior is fantastic; the exterior will take a bit of time to get used to but concurring with Backy, let\\'s see if we\\'d get a different one for the NA spec.This perhaps is a better angle:Thumbs up on the interior:  Maybe my problem with the new face is that there\\'s nothing special about it. It looks to me like a cross between the previous-generation Passat, the Elantra, and the Sebring. At least the old face had some edginess to it, and was honest in its simplicity. And the wheels look just like the vent on my (rather cheap) Coleman outdoor grill. \"Dislike\" is too mild for those, IMO--\"detest\" is closer. :P BTW, got a \\'07 Sonata SE rental tonight--silver with those slick 5-spoke alloys. Very tasteful. And a toasty heater--needed that tonight, with flurries in the air and a 40 mph north wind. Car was very stable and quiet in those conditions though.  this is the future (maybe the reason why Honda discontinued the Accord Hybrid) with oil approaching $100.00 but this is going to be one slow car. Maybe 10 sec. 0-60 based on the 150hp, but also something that will feel quicker than it is (because of the torque). It kinda surprises me in that Honda didn\\'t diesel a V6 and get something like MB does with their 3.2 6 cylinder, 200+hp and 400 lb. ft., a car that really does pretty well both in the drag races and at the fuel pump. 40 mpg? It should!  Since the Accord hybrid would get better mileage than the regular Accord,why would they discontinue the hybrid? I dont understand your justification for that.I submit that they should make all Honda\\'s hybrids.At perhaps $4.00 per gallon approaching,who cares about acceleration? :confuse:  That a midlevel Hyundai has a better interior than just about any of the American nameplates. I don\\'t know why the domestics cannot make an interior like this.   Maybe 10 sec. 0-60 based on the 150hp, but also something that will feel quicker than it is (because of the torque).I don\\'t know about that. I\\'d wager more like mid to high 8s for that run. That\\'s a lot of torque for a FWD car so I hope they do something else to reduce the torque steer that is inevitable. It kinda surprises me in that Honda didn\\'t diesel a V6 and get something like MB does with their 3.2 6 cylinder, 200+hp and 400 lb. ft., a car that really does pretty well both in the drag races and at the fuel pumpThey are, but it wasn\\'t in that article. This article suggests that they will use their new diesel tech on an SUV like the Pilot. That is why I eluded to the Honda SUV/CUVs getting diesel in \\'09 as well. I would expect those to be V6 versions probably similar to the 200 HP and 400 ft-lbs the Benz makes. Give me 25+ mpg in the city in a Pilot, or dare I say even a Ridgeline, and I\\'ll certainly visit the Honda dealer when shopping in \\'09.  If that\\'s the same photo that has been floating around the net, the DIN-sized electronics device lower in the center stack that looks out of place is a taxi meter. This is a shot of a Korean taxi version.Well let\\'s hope it is just that! Although, that looks like a pretty darn fancy taxi meter to me. Cabbies must have it real good over in Korea. :shades:  Since the Accord hybrid would get better mileage than the regular Accord,why would they discontinue the hybrid? Because nobody bought them. Remember the Accord was a V6 hybrid - it wasn\\'t a fuel miser.  The interior obviously created picking the mind belonging to Lexus\\' RX330. The center of the dash is almost a carbon copy, add to that the half wooded steering wheel, and wood trim.  It started with Veracruz, while looking at Lexus RX.  Accord will get 155 HP/260 lb-ft version of 2.2-liter i-DTEC engine. That should enable it to run 0-60 in 8s, far from being slow. There will be another higher output version of the engine, with 180 HP/320 lb-ft, but likely reserved for higher performance trim in Europe.V6 diesel is also supposed to happen, but will likely be limited to light trucks (Odyssey, Pilot and Ridgeline).  That front clip looks like a 90s Toyota Crown. I was never a fan of this car, but... yeah, I\\'m still not a fan of this car.  The Accord hybrid was (as Hondas aren\\'t) not a true hybrid - in the Accord\\'s case a V6 with cylinder deactivation (a system now used in all the V6s) and a supplementary electric motor that really served only to make the car even quicker that the regular V6. FE was not significantly better, in that the car was not a true hybrid in the same way as the Camry/Altima hybrids. And sure, at 4 or $5/gallon acceleration may become a secondary consideration, although I would suggest to you that gas prices in Europe exceed even $5 and there is still a market for something other than \\'appliances\\'. Diesel technology is such that a diesel Accord wouldn\\'t necessarily have to be dull. My comment was only some disppointment that Honda chose the \\'appliance\\' path with a 150hp 4 banger, the FE better be good to put up it.  That should enable it to run 0-60 in 8s, far from being slowat the risk of starting an interminable debate about hp and torque - I would suggest to you that this car will only \\'feel\\' like its running in the 8s, and actually be slower than its 2.4 liter gas engined cousins pulling a car that should be heavier than the already bloated Accord- much like the E320CDI is slower (and heavier) than the E350 although it feels \\'peppier\\' and delivers much better FE of course. I guess we\\'ll have to wait to see how the car tests but it is HP (torque applied over time) that is still the primary influence on any car\\'s ability to accelerate. The Accord diesel, IMO, would be an easier \\'sacrifice\\' for most folks to make if, as I said earlier, they could offer it at 200hp+/400 lb.ft (probably requiring a v6) and somewhere around 30 mpg overall because then at least the car would be fun to drive. I believe that Honda with a 150hp Accord diesel will have the same sort of acceptance issues that the VW Rabbit/Golf/Passat have had for years.  You are focusing on peak numbers. Performance is determined by average power that is delivered to the wheels during any run. Torque curve from a diesel engine tends to be much higher than comparable gasoline engine, but it is also narrower. The upside to this downside is that the peak power is very close to average power during any run (a fact).In case of Accord&#146;s 2.2-liter i-DTEC, 100 HP would be available at just 2000 rpm, which climbs to 155 HP over a span of next 2000 rpm (from 2000 rpm to 4000 rpm). This indicates a relatively flat power curve. With a few assumptions that the diesel will use V6-like gearing, you&#146;re looking at 100 HP at just 13 mph in first gear. OTOH, 100 HP in gasoline powered Accord corresponds to about 23 mph in first gear. Interestingly enough, 13 mph in gasoline powered Accord would also correspond to 2000 rpm, but it would have only 55-60 HP at its disposal. You could work the math upwards for other speeds, like I have, to understand it better.Now, I do expect diesel to weigh (realistically) 125-150 lb more than comparable gasoline powered version. And I had that covered in my estimate for 0-60. BTW, you can expect to see it do 0-60 in about 8s with MT. Add almost a second for AT. That would still make it quicker than most four cylinder family sedans and on par with 190 HP Accord. Its got the potential to generate almost 1.7 times as much thrust (100 HP at 13 mph in diesel/~58 HP at 13 mph in gasoline) without weighing 1.7 times.Besides, it is not just the feel of being peppier, it would be a fact. Most magazines bog themselves down with measuring 0-60 runs, which I think is one of the most useless measures around. Rolling acceleration matters more but few seem to care about it. Given that diesel might cruise at 2000 rpm at 60 mph in top gear, minor hills that may require a downshift in gasoline version, would be unnecessary in this one, since all it would take is opening the throttle as up to 100 HP would be on tap. With gasoline, the engine will need to be revved up to about 3500 rpm to get 100 HP.See... it didn&#146;t need to be about power and torque, just power.   I&#146;m always amused at the sound of someone suggesting IMA not being a true hybrid. A hybrid is a hybrid, when it is capable of being propelled by hybrid power train system. Honda took a simpler approach than most. Instead of an overhauled design, the concept itself is brilliant: Replace the flywheel of an engine with a thin electric motor and voila! The problem is around storage capacity. For packaging, cost and weight reasons, smaller battery pack make more sense, and that was Honda&#146;s approach. Otherwise, they could have used the big motor and battery pack (which is now an ultra-capacitor pack) from EV-Plus currently available around as the FCX.With Accord, Honda chose performance model, to address folks like you who keep complaining about less power (you&#146;re doing that against diesel, wanting a V6). I always doubted Honda&#146;s choice for going with hybrid on the top trim, for sale reasons. They should have started with a lesser trim with a lower base price. But I think, diesel would be a better option in bigger vehicles, Accord and above. It will be really interesting to watch Accord Diesel go against Camry/Altima/Aura/Malibu hybrids in the near future.  I&#146;m always amused at the sound of someone suggesting IMA not being a true hybrid.It probably would have been stated better if he had said a \"full hybrid\" which is probably what he meant. Vehicles like the Prius and Escape Hybrid are considered to be full hybrids while vehicles like the Civic Hybrid are considered to be partial hybrids. I don\\'t know who defined what a full or partial hybrid is so please don\\'t shoot the messenger if you don\\'t agree. :shades:  \"Full\" hybrids can run on electric power alone while \"mild\" hybrids simply shut off the combustion engine when the vehicle stops.  Can these hybrids keep the air conditioner going in the heat of summer, or the heat going in the middle of the winter?  It appears from Hyundai\\'s domestic site info that the Sonata\\'s 2.4 4-cylinder will put out 179 hp. The pics in this forum IMO aren\\'t as good as those from Hyundai\\'s site. This is a much improved car. I am interested to drive the new suspension, engines and to see this interior up close.  The Accord diesel, IMO, would be an easier \\'sacrifice\\' for most folks to make if, as I said earlier, they could offer it at 200hp+/400 lb.ft (probably requiring a v6) and somewhere around 30 mpg overall because then at least the car would be fun to drive. I think Honda made the mistake of going with a \"performance\" hybrid, when they used a V6 engine. It obviously didn\\'t work. With the diesel, I think Honda is going in the opposite direction. Fuel economy will be the main attraction for this car, and that IMO will make it a big hit. Honda is NOT going for the \"performance\" crowd with this one. If you want performance, the V6 (gasoline) version will be for you.  I am not sure whether Civic Hybrid does, but Accord Hybrid did. It didn\\'t require engine to run when climate control had to be on.  It is an irony that the ability to run solely on electric power has to define a &#147;hybrid&#148;, much less a &#147;full&#148; hybrid. That should make an electric-only vehicle fullest hybrid. :PI find terms like parallel and series hybrid far more logical. Some of them can be dual mode (work in either/or mode) while some others might use them both at some point.The &#147;full&#148;, &#147;mild&#148;, &#147;true&#148;, &#147;false&#148; or whatever term seem to have come from marketing PR material, propagated by sales folks and magazines. A series hybrid is just as much a &#147;true&#148; hybrid with batteries as without (in which case, it cannot run solely in electric mode), as would be a parallel hybrid or any combination of. &#147;Mild&#148; might be acceptable term however, since the car may rely more on gasoline/diesel engine for a significant portion of operation but even some of them (Civic Hybrid) are capable of running in electric mode under some circumstances, blurring the line.But, we might be going well out of the realms of the subject.  \"Full\" hybrids can run on electric power alone while \"mild\" hybrids simply shut off the combustion engine when the vehicle stops. That is partially correct if I\\'m not mistaken. Full hybrids are full hybrids and there isn\\'t much difference between any of them. Mild, or partial, hybrids come in many flavors. You have those which only shut off the engine when stopped. Then there are some which power two wheels with a small electric motor like the GM pickups (totally useless IMO). Then there\\'s those like the Civic which, and corrrect me if I\\'m wrong, use an electric motor somewhere between the gas engine and wheels to assist the gas motor. There are more variations of the mild hybrids IIRC but I think I made my point.   this is very simple - diesel powered cars don\\'t accelerate well because the engine is slower to pick up rpm and are in fact rev limited to much lower rpms, so in effect it doesn\\'t put all that torque to good use - which BTW is the mathematical definition of HP - (torque*rpm)/5252. There is a direct correlation between car acceleration times and HP and vehice weight (hp per lb.) and not necessarily with torque. What I am saying is that the 260 lb. ft. lb. will improve the drivability of the new Accord diesel as well as provide the a nice sort of \\'kick\\' on initial throttle application only. It will still be the 150hp (and the extra weight) though that makes it a slow car. Relative to something like a diesel the gas engine puts out more of that usable horsepower simply because it can (and does) rev more freely and quickly. Anybody that has spent anytime with the VW diesels knows what I mean - a car that \\'feels\\' faster than it is.Whether it\\'ll beat 10 seconds to 60 I don\\'t know but I also think that the auto buyer is not ready to return to those underpowered \\'wundercars\\' of the 80s and early 90s (or FTM manual trannies) all in the interest of saving 10-15 gallons of fuel a month.  Whether it\\'ll beat 10 seconds to 60 I don\\'t know but I also think that the auto buyer is not ready to return to those underpowered \\'wundercars\\' of the 80s and early 90s (or FTM manual trannies) all in the interest of saving 10-15 gallons of fuel a month.I think the Accord diesel engine will be more advanced than those engines of the 80\\'s and 90\\'s. Honda will, I\\'m sure, pair the engine with a transmission that will get the most out of the package. You may be surprised.  I have always understood that torque does actually make the car quicker at slower speeds (lower RPMs) - yes?? It just doesn\\'t carry through to higher RPM\\'s / speeds. Do I have this right? Ft/Lbs of torque is a better measure of off-the-line performance than is horse power --- correct?  ... but I also think that the auto buyer is not ready to return to those underpowered \\'wundercars\\' of the 80s and early 90s (or FTM manual trannies) all in the interest of saving 10-15 gallons of fuel a month.I humbly disagree, Captain. When gasoline gets to $5 a gallon, which will be sooner rather than later, 10 to 15 gallons a month translates into $50 to $75 a month. I am already regretting buying a 3.0-liter V6 AWD 2007 Fusion because of its horrific (14.8) in-city gas mileage.Indeed, our next car may well be the new four-cylinder diesel from Honda, if and when it arrives on the market, preferably with a six-speed automatic.  Torque by itself is meaningless. I can generate 300 ft/lbs of torque with my arm but I can\\'t generate many RPM. HP is torque x RPM so you can get more HP by increasing torque or by increasing RPM. The advantage of having more torque available at lower RPM is that it makes more HP than having less torque at the same RPM. And when you\\'re doing a 0-60 run you have to get through the lower RPM range before you get to the upper RPM range. In the end, it\\'s all about HP. But an engine with more torque at lower RPM will have more HP available off the line.  Just saw this on CNNMoney site: Malibu vs CamryLots of praise for the new \\'Bu.  From the review:From now on, those who go blindly to Honda and Toyota dealers in search of their next mid-sized sedan will be making a serious mistake.\"From now on\"? CNN is a little late to the party with that line. But it\\'s nice to see that they have healthy respect for the new Malibu.I don\\'t think it was a coincidence, however, that GM invited the press to the Malibu/Camry comparo before the 2008 Accord was available for testing.   \"\"From now on\"? CNN is a little late to the party with that line. But it\\'s nice to see that they have healthy respect for the new Malibu.\"Heck, CNNMoney is making a mistake if they expect the American buying public to see their views. After all, a consumer who pays cash is never wrong.  $50 to $75 is maybe just an average and may also be more. Certainly can make a difference for a lot of folks. In your case if your Fusion is only delivering 15 mpg for your particular driving conditions and habits, then I would also suggest that this Accord diesel is likely going to get you \\'only\\'about 10 or 12 more mpg in the same conditions. Not to poo-poo the significance of that, have no idea how much you drive, but in these days of our \\'appliance\\' (as one poster contends) 4 door sedans in some cases leaving \\'muscle cars\\' in the dust are we really going to happy with 150hp pulling along 3500-3600 lbs or more. Not that I have any problem with the diesel per se, I really believe that this is where we are heading (near term) but I wish that Honda would have taken a more \\'performance\\' approach instead of just out and out FE. Such things are possible these days even with diesels. If we really wanted appliances, we could all line up to buy the Camry and Altima hybrids, which apparently don\\'t justify their cost premiums especially over the short term. This all said, I\\'m relatively confident that the Accord diesel will be met with an adoring audience and possibly even some good reviews (from everybody except the enthusiast mags) and sell at some premium over MSRP.  I have always understood that torque does actually make the car quicker at slower speeds (lower RPMs) - yes?? no, that torque only makes the car feel quicker, if that torque can not be turned into HP it will have no effect on things like acceleration times. Akirby has it right, in effect, torque is meaningless.  Diesel engines may lack some responsiveness of gasoline engines, but they don&#146;t have to rev higher to have higher average power. So that aspect evens out. What does higher average power get you? It will potentially improve average power to weight ratio which in turn would help improve performance.You are trying to make a point on power but getting bogged down by looking at torque, and treating them as independent entities when they are not. The bottom line is, torque is only as good as the power it helps generate. If you know power, there is no need to re-focus on torque that you are doing in that &#147;kick-in&#148; argument.If you are aware of characteristics of a diesel engine, you would also know that diesel engines tend to have flatter power curve, whereas a gasoline engine with broader torque curve will have a steadily rising power curve. The former was also a big part of muscle cars until recently. They had lot of torque but peak was usually low but average power was higher than it was in higher revving but equally powerful performance engines.If you could operate solely at peak power (155 HP in Accord Diesel, 158 HP in Camry, 169 HP in Malibu or 177-190 HP in Accord) using a CVT, then Accord diesel would have no chance as it will not have that higher average power advantage anymore while also weighing more. But reality is different. Engines operate over a range. So, contrary to your belief, a diesel&#146;s usable power is closer to its peak. That is one reason why, despite being heavier and less powerful, the current European Accord Diesel (138 HP) is quicker than European Accord 2.0 (155 HP). It is slower than the more powerful Accord 2.4 (190 HP) however, but not by much.For these reasons, don&#146;t expect the Accord Diesel to be a slouch when it comes to performance. It won&#146;t match the performance of most V6 powered versions but with 0-60 in about 9.0s with auto transmission, it will be one of the quicker four cylinder family sedans (by comparison, the new Malibu got it done in 10s).What car do you drive?Are we really going to happy with 150hp pulling along 3500-3600 lbs or moreLike I suggested earlier, you won&#146;t be if you only stuck with peak power. In reality, a 3500-3600 lb diesel car is likely to have better power to weight ratio than a similar gasoline powered 3400-3500 lb car. That would be due to higher average power in diesel. Remember, diesel engines don&#146;t have steadily rising power curve, so the average power over operating range is closer to the rated peak power than it is in gasoline powered cars.I illustrated this earlier. 190 HP Accord (3400+ lb) or 169 HP Malibu (3400+ lb) have higher peak power, but do would they have higher average power? I don&#146;t know the gearing for Malibu, so I will use the Accord, and apply V6 gearing for the diesel.In first gear, Accord Diesel 2000 rpm (100 HP) will correspond with 13+ mph and 4000 rpm (155 HP) will correspond with about 27 mph. Median power accelerating from 13 to 27 mph: 127.5 HP.The same speed range will correspond with 2000 rpm (55 HP) and 4300 rpm (130 HP) in Accord 2.4. The median power: 92.5 HP.Now, even if the diesel tipped the scale at 3550 lb, it would have 27.8 lb/HP at the median. For gasoline with 3425 lb, it would be 37 lb/HP. Now you know why the diesel would feel peppier.Unless the gasoline version operates over a range where its average power is higher than that from diesel, it won&#146;t perform better simply by virtue of having higher peak power or 100 lb less weight. The focus needs to go beyond peak output ratings.  I agree with you. And while to many $50/month may not seem like much, I (and it seems you are too) prefer to look at the bigger picture. Ownership cost over extended time is important or I would just lease a luxury car and pay less per month than I do buying a mainstream car. A $50/month in savings over only 5 years would translate to a whopping $3K savings at the pump.But 15 mpg is VERY low for a midsize family sedan. Have you had dealership check out your car? What are your driving conditions?  Engine rpm translates to wheel speed. Torque is related to thrust. Power combines them both. So, torque by itself is meaningless, while simply knowing power can reveal quite a few things. For example, if there are two cars, identical in all aspects but power/torque output, if one of them produces 200 HP on average during a run compared to another that produced 160 HP, even if the second had higher average torque, it will be outperformed by the first by 25% (200/160=1.25).Now, this 25% advantage in power doesn&#146;t necessarily imply higher speed (most folks associate power solely with speed and torque with force, and while partly correct, the argument has big flaws). Power by definition relates speed and force. In fact, it balances them. A car with 200 HP (average) may be going 25% faster than another with 200 HP (average). On the flip side, the second car will have 25% greater thrust. So, neither is outperforming the other (200/200=1.00), but compensating in different ways.This is why, for traditional performance measurements (acceleration), it is better to relate power and speed. The best way to understand this is to use a CVT setup as it can allow certain power during acceleration (that power replaces the &#147;average&#148; power). Doing so, if we have two similar cars, one produces 200 HP (but only 160 lb-ft) during the run and the other has 160 HP (but 200 lb-ft) during the run, the 200 HP car will out-accelerate the other car with higher torque, and will feel peppier (by 25%).The key is in average power generated during a run.  But 15 mpg is VERY low for a midsize family sedan. Have you had dealership check out your car? What are your driving conditions?The revised (lower) EPA rating for this power train, V6, AWD, is 17 mpg city and 24 mpg highway. Yes, the dealer put it on a portable computer at 1,500 miles and everything checked out OK.Our in-city driving is stop \\'n\\' go, short hops, but not bumper-to-bumper. Our terrain is as flat as a pool table, the tires are properly inflated and my wife and I are gentle, conservative drivers. I think the AWD is the gas culprit. On the only trip we have taken with it -- 360 miles round trip -- it delivered 26 mpg going and 24 mpg returning.The 2007 SEL Fusion is a great car except for this mileage problem, which is of great concern since gasoline is at $3 a gallon and heading north. Fortunately, we don\\'t drive the car all that much: Only have 5,300 miles on it since Dec. 4, 2006.  But 15 mpg is VERY low for a midsize family sedan. Have you had dealership check out your car? What are your driving conditions?My Optima gets even less MPG in town.14.something.I blame the fact that it never has a chance to warm up,since usually the trips are less than 2 miles.Yes...it is a 4Cyl,and the HP is 161.Plenty peppy enough for me.  We\\'ve been through this many times. His typical commute is very low speed, lots of stop and go and only about 5 miles - hardly enough time to get the engine warmed up. It\\'s not the car - it\\'s the driving.  Who says the diesel will be that much heavier than the gasser Accord? It all depends on the trim Honda chooses to pair the diesel with. In LX-P trim a 3236lb gasser won\\'t preform much different from a 3300lb? diesel.  By MMC time when the 4 cyl EX will have 200+HP there might a diff but till then performance won\\'t be a differentiator between any of the 4 cyl Accords.  I suppose this could be more entertaining than an auto w/out manual overrides, and perhaps a little more convenient than automatics w/ overrides... but I\\'m not sure I\\'d find the experience w/ paddle shifters a big deal beyond the novelty of it. Perhaps you\\'re wondering why I\\'m bringing this up... I saw a pic of the next gen mazda6 and it showed paddle shifters. Of course it\\'s possible these are only for europe and/or Japan since the north america specs have not been released...sorry for the supersized pic, but I don\\'t have a way to resize at work...  My assumption is based on a few things. I&#146;ve seen Honda&#146;s current diesel engine (which, I believe was a first for using aluminum block) mentioned weighing 375 lb, about 100 lb more than the number I have seen for 2.2-liter used previously in Accord/Prelude. My guess is that the current 2.4 in Accord weighs about the same (or probably is lighter) than the old 2.2. Also, to handle the extra torque, a beefier transmission is required. So my guess is that the transmission will be shared with Accord V6, and that may add a few pounds.And finally, identically equipped, Accord EX/Diesel in UK weighs about 79 kg more than Accord EX/2.4. That translates to 170 lb. In some applications, the difference is less, so 150 lb would be a logical guess.If it is put in LX-P trim which weighs around 3250 lb I believe, then LX-P/diesel would be around 3400 lb. If it is EX trim (about 3425 lb), then the diesel would be 3550-3600 lb. But diesel has more than enough grunt to make up for the additional weight, when it comes to accelerative performance. It will lack some in high HP scenario, but unlikely to be experienced in around town driving. It should get 30-35% better fuel economy (in the real world), however.  Since Fusion uses a reactive AWD system (rear wheels engage only if slippage is detected in the front wheels), I don&#146;t think AWD is the culprit. And I don&#146;t think EPA considers impact from different types of AWD system either. Permanent AWD systems (like Acura&#146;s SH-AWD or BMW&#146;s x-Drive) that keep all wheels engaged at all times are mostly covered, but in reactive system as in Fusion, Escape, CR-V etc (or even proactive/reactive systems like Honda&#146;s VTM-4), they don&#146;t have a test cycle for it. My bet would be that they simply deduct a percentage off for just having an AWD system.Now a reactive AWD can have an impact anyway, due to additional weight (logical guess would be 125-150 lb) but it should be negligible. So, if not your car, then your driving conditions might be it. The worst tanks in my 98 Accord over its 183K miles so far returned 23-24 mpg seen for about a year when I lived within 2 miles from office. Otherwise, 26 mpg is the norm in mixed driving (up to 33 mpg at 75 mph on freeway).So, driving conditions do affect a lot. In addition, I don&#146;t idle my cars much after cold starts. While a bit longer during winter, 10-15 seconds is the norm. Engine warms up quicker when rolling, I just take care to not be aggressive with the throttle until it does. Despite its age/miles, Accord will warm up in a little over a quarter mile (up to half mile on colder days). That can also help improve fuel economy a bit.You could try some of these things, besides less braking (or avoiding it as much as possible), and could see 10-15% improvement. For me, less braking might be helping. I&#146;ve replaced front brake pads only once in my 183K mile Accord (the current pads have 93K miles on them). The rear brake pads were replaced at about 132K miles so they have about 61K miles so far. As a result, even my TL gets me 25-26 mpg consistently. And I\\'m one of the fastest drivers on the road.  I got a chance to drive my friend\\'s Hybrid Accord yesterday. What a powerful car !!!!! Accleration is effortless and you can easily get 35 + mpg. I am surprised the car didn\\'t sell well. Personally, I would definitely prefer the Hybrid Accord over the diesel.  Since Fusion uses a reactive AWD system (rear wheels engage only if slippage is detected in the front wheels),Wrong again. Ford\\'s AWD system used in the Fusion, Taurus and Edge will actually predict the need for power to the rear before slippage occurs based on driver inputs (throttle position, etc.). This is far more useful than a reactive only system.  the only fuel saving technology in the now discontinued Accord Hybrid really was the variable displacement system used to minimize fuel consumption the V6. For 08 this system is now standard on all V6s. As on all Honda \\'Hybrids\\' the electric motors are provided to essentially supplement the gas engine, no to periodically replace it - as on the Toyota system, for example. Since electric motors provide maximum torque at 0 rpm (at startup) the Accord Hybrid is indeed very quick with the additional benefit of that 240hp V6 working on all its cylinders. There is however very little benefit to the system in terms of fuel economy - which I guess is why Honda has had trouble getting folks to pay the extra money for it. The diesel, of course, will change all that and may actually justify an assummed price premium over the standard 4 banger.  I will be curious where \"again\" came from. But as far as Fusion\\'s AWD system is concerned, this should tell you something you might not be aware of. An excerpt:The Ford-developed technology is similar in many ways to the Haldex system, Kurrle says, without revealing exactly what changes were made. &#147;This is a &#145;slip-and-grip&#146; system. It detects the slip of the front wheels and transfers torque, similar to the Haldex system.&#148;  boy, do I have some swampland for you - another case of believing some of that seemingly endless publicity. Perhaps you would like to explain how the car can \\'know\\'this and can anticipate that icy spot on the road or whatever, thereby correctly guessing something is going to happen before it does. My God, just think about it. Of course, systems like this are reactive, just like SC systems, and not just Ford\\'s.  Just ask him what his mpg was when he drove a Focus, then you will know it is the type of driving and not the car.  Maybe THIS will tell you something that you obviously aren\\'t aware of:&#147;What&#146;s really impressive about these systems is that they don&#146;t just react to slip,&#148; says Rodrigues. &#147;They usually prevent that slip from occurring in the first place. By predicting slip and preventing it, the driver doesn&#146;t feel the vehicle slipping and responding. The operation is seamless.&#148;  Perhaps you would like to explain how the car can \\'know\\'this and can anticipate that icy spot on the road or whatever, thereby correctly guessing something is going to happen before it does. My God, just think about it. Of course, systems like this are reactive, just like SC systems, and not just Ford\\'s.Ok, try to pay attention this time. Of course the system reacts to an icy spot by sensing a loss of traction in the front wheels and transferring torque to the rear. It has to do that. But what it ALSO does is sense when rear torque is likely to be needed BEFORE slip occurs. How does it do this? Simple. The computer knows the steering angle and the throttle position at all times. If you\\'re accelerating into a turn or just accelerating hard then it knows this before slippage occurs and it can compensate.It\\'s not rocket science.  That is marketing bunk. AWD/4WD vehicles cannot predict slip. They can only react when slip occurs, even before the driver knows it\\'s occuring. How in sam hill for example, can an AWD tell if it\\'s raining and the limits of grip are lower? The obvious answer is they can\\'t. It can only react to a preprogrammed difference in input parameters for the system.BMW which IMO has the best DSC type in it\\'s class, cannot predict slip. The system only reacts on inputs so miniscule the driver does not know it.  I see more marketing talk there than technical. What is being done to &#147;proactively&#148; counter slip? There is no mention of that. What I do see is that under non-slip conditions, Fusion&#146;s AWD system doesn&#146;t come into effect.No AWD can pre-detect slippage. Some may pro-actively engage all wheels during situations that may induce slippage. Honda&#146;s VTM-4 system used in Pilot has an Acceleration Torque Control module to do that. All wheels are engaged whenever the vehicle is accelerated. Otherwise the system remains reactive, waiting for slip detection and fix (&#147;seamlessly&#148; in marketing speak).Does Fusion have something similar that engages all wheels by expecting slippage as opposed to functioning only when detecting one?Even then, these systems do not put as much drag on drive line as do those that are engaged permanently (that is one of the ideas behind developing such systems). So, they shouldn&#146;t affect fuel economy as much either.  The computer knows the steering angle and the throttle position at all times.exactly, the computer is REACTING to that steering angle and throttle position, and therefore pushing a little power to the rear wheels. As you say ain\\'t exactly rocket science.  Why is it marketing bunk? Because Ford developed it? Or just because you don\\'t understand it?From an engineering standpoint it\\'s quite simple. First, remember that this is an electro-mechanical system, not a mechanical only system. If it was mechanical only then you would be correct. The Fusion has ETC so the computer knows the throttle position. It also knows the steering angle. If you accelerate while turning the computer says \"hey - there might be a loss of traction\" so it tells the center diff to shift torque to the rear wheels - BEFORE IT ACTUALLY STARTS TO SLIP.It has nothing to do with whether the front wheels would actually slip or not - it doesn\\'t matter. It shifts the torque to prevent a POSSIBLE slip.If BMW\\'s AWD system doesn\\'t work that way then maybe they need to license the technology from Ford.  robert - I guess we\\'re kinda on the same page on this, but the only system I know of that proactively does anything is the \\'Collison Avoidance\\' systems on some of the Lexus (MB?) models and even that is tightening seatbelts, disabling throttle and applying the brakes in REACTION to what it (the computer) sees as an impending collison. Dangerous stuff IMO.  But the point is it shifts the torque BEFORE the front wheels lose traction, so it\\'s not ONLY reacting to front wheel slippage - it\\'s also preventing it under some circumstances.  Does Fusion have something similar that engages all wheels by expecting slippage as opposed to functioning only when detecting one?It does both - shifts torque when slippage is detected AND shifts torque when slippage is expected.  but you don\\'t concede the fact that this (and many other systems) are really reacting to what some computer programmer somewhere is really guessing to be a problem - in this case your precious steering angle combined with a throttle setting. Think about it - this is Pandora\\'s box - a computer program making driving decisions for us. This does, BTW, go well past silly AWD systems BTW and can be more invasive than simply routing some power to the rear wheels. Of course Ford is well behind the curve on things like SC systems. Since so many folks want these kind of things I wonder how many sales Ford loses simply because it won\\'t add an extra circuit to the brake systems (and a yaw sensor) on the Fusion and therefore doesn\\'t even offer Stability Control - for any price. That\\'s OK I guess, Ford will do it when the government forces them to.  That\\'s an entirely different argument - whether the computer should be making these decisions for us. The original assertion was that it only sent torque to the rear if slippage was detected and that\\'s not true.I\\'m sure Ford is losing a few sales over lack of SC in the Fusion. But that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re behind the curve from a technology standpoint. SC was available in 1999 on the Lincoln LS (as was manumatic shifting) so the technology is there. They were also the first to put roll stability control on a SUV IIRC. You could argue the same thing about the Camcord\\'s lack of AWD. Ford decided to spend the money on AWD while Toyota and Honda spent it on 4 channel ABS and SC. And just because YOU prefer SC over AWD doesn\\'t mean everyone does. Next year the Fusion will have both AWD and SC. Where does that leave the Camcords?  Why is it marketing bunk? Because Ford developed it? Or just because you don\\'t understand it? Because this would make them the first manufacturer on the face of the planet to predict slip \"before\" it occurs and that ain\\'t so. You cannot predict \"slip\" any more than you can predict the stock market.It has nothing to do with whether the front wheels would actually slip or not - it doesn\\'t matter. It shifts the torque to prevent a POSSIBLE slip. They can say whatever they want different systems work differently. But I\\'ll repeat....Slip can not be predicted and therefore proactive shift of torque to prevent slip is an impossibility.  Where can I read about that? I haven\\'t found anything on the topic.  Acura\\'s CMBS system is another. But we would be digressing from the topic.One example of engaging all wheels proactively (as in... no need to detect slippage before doing so) in an AWD system is Honda\\'s VTM-4. But, it doesn\\'t know if a slippage will occur. It will simply engage all wheels when the vehicle is being accelerated. There might be other systems like it, but so far I haven\\'t found anything that suggests Ford\\'s AWD in Fusion/Milan works like that (or engages without detecting any loss of traction). I will now leave that for akirby to provide us with the details.  but you don\\'t concede the fact that this (and many other systems) are really reacting to what some computer programmer somewhere is really guessing to be a problem In that case evey AWD/4WD system should be called a \"reactive\" system. Even a full time system like those in Subarus are reacting to something electronic or mechanical in the driveline. Akirby\\'s point is that 4WD can be engaged in the Fusion without slippage of the front wheels. Our Explorer has the same system, but for RWD, and I do feel the rear wheels slip in snow, ice, and sometimes rain before the front wheels kick in too. What I don\\'t feel is when it might be kicking in going around a bend or something like that. But the part you really need it for IMO, which would be getting better traction in slippery conditions, is totally reactive and you can feel the wheels slip a little at first.Does that make a little more sense or am I just adding to the confusion? :blush: Of course Ford is well behind the curve on things like SC systems. Whoa now captain. They may be behind in offering in on their fleet of cars but all of the SUVs/CUVs, and optional on some cars now, have it standard. And what Ford uses is not the same animal as what other mfrs offer. Look up Volvo\\'s SC with RSC system and you\\'ll see the difference right away. Most mfrs are now copying it but I have yet to hear of one that\\'s better than what Volvo and therefore Ford use.  One example of engaging all wheels proactively (as in... no need to detect slippage before doing so) in an AWD system is Honda\\'s VTM-4. But, it doesn\\'t know if a slippage will occur. It will simply engage all wheels when the vehicle is being accelerated. That seems really silly to have it work that way. Why not just send a little power to the other two wheels all the time rather than programming it to start from 0% and work up from there each time the accelerator is depressed? Is it a cost savings thing so they don\\'t have to add another clutch or something? :confuse:  Where can I read about that? I haven\\'t found anything on the topic.I posted the link in post 7051. Here it is again:Ford Media Article  now that most cars in this segment are very reliable, it\\'s refreshing that I\\'m not married to a brand anymore and am willing to consider other options.Where do you get that incorrect idea, impression, and opinion?  Because this would make them the first manufacturer on the face of the planet to predict slip \"before\" it occurs and that ain\\'t so. You cannot predict \"slip\" any more than you can predict the stock market.Slip can not be predicted and therefore proactive shift of torque to prevent slip is an impossibility.You are absolutely totally missing the point. Slip is most likely to occur when accelerating briskly or when cornering. Doesn\\'t mean that it will occur - just that it\\'s possible or even likely depending the road conditions. Ford\\'s AWD software senses one or both of those conditions and sends torque to the rear to AVOID a potential slip situation.Why is that so hard to comprehend? All you need is a steering angle sensor, throttle sensor, electrically controlled center diff and some softwtare. It\\'s not rocket science.  Ford\\'s AWD software senses one or both of those conditions and sends torque to the rear to AVOID a potential slip situation. Ok, I understand what you are saying. The Ford system detects acceleration shifts accordingly. That is different than saying it is able to predict slippage.As a comparision, Subaru\\'s system has been doing that for years. I posted a description in this thread earlier.  Here\\'s a list of mid-sized cars that are above average in predicted reliability according to CR:Accord (based on history--current model is a new design)Camry I4FusionMilanPassat V6PriusSonataThose cover a very large percentage of cars sold in this segment. Several others are at least average:Malibu (pre-2008 model)Mazda6GalantG6Altima, Aura, Optima, and Avenger/Sebring are too new for CR to have enough data to rate them for reliability. Altima has historically been reliable.  That article doesn\\'t speak anything about being pro-active. It does about the system being FWD-only under normal driving conditions. What do you think is \"non-normal\"? (since the link you provided doesn\\'t talk about it) Thats the missing link.  SH-AWD does that with all wheels engaged at all times, and it is an evolution of VTM-4. But like I said earlier, permanent AWD systems come with a cost. Sending power to additional wheels on occasions when it makes no discernable difference does nothing but adds to drive train loss (which equals reduced fuel economy). So, while VTM-4 is capable of sending up to 70% of the torque to rear wheels, it won&#146;t keep any part of it during steady state cruising conditions. 2WD is easier on fuel economy than 4WD with all wheels engaged.VTM-4 does allow a lock mode to engage all wheels permanently, and will keep it that way for as long as you choose to drive under 18 mph. :P  That article doesn\\'t speak anything about being pro-active. It does about the system being FWD-only under normal driving conditions. What do you think is \"non-normal\"? (since the link you provided doesn\\'t talk about it) Thats the missing link.Umm....how about the entire last paragraph? Try this:Simple mechanical systems use a clutch to send torque to the secondary drive axle when the primary axle starts to slip. Today&#146;s electronic systems &#151; like those found on all Ford Motor Company cars as well as Ford Explorer and Expedition, the Lincoln Navigator and the V-8 Mercury Mountaineer &#151; use a computer controller that monitors such things as steering angle, accelerator pedal position and engine speed to provide the precise amount of torque, front to rear, as needed.&#147;What&#146;s really impressive about these systems is that they don&#146;t just react to slip,&#148; says Rodrigues. &#147;They usually prevent that slip from occurring in the first place. By predicting slip and preventing it, the driver doesn&#146;t feel the vehicle slipping and responding. The operation is seamless.&#148;He says on-demand systems create a smooth, confident driving feel in all weather conditions with much better traction. The systems also help balance and improve driving dynamics by sending torque to the secondary axle when it&#146;s most appropriate for handling.&#147;On a normal front-drive vehicle, the front wheels have a limited amount of traction available to them,&#148; says Rodrigues. &#147;That traction has to be used for moving the car forward and for steering. If you use all of the torque to drive forward, you don&#146;t have anything left to steer with, and vise versa. An AWD system off-loads some of that drive torque to the rear wheels. The harder you accelerate, the more of that torque that&#146;s going to be redirected to the rear wheels, restoring the ability of the front wheels to steer the vehicle while providing an even higher level of acceleration.&#148;   Again, it doesn\\'t tell you anything about the condition(s) that the system sees as having a potential to cause slippage. That is the missing piece.The paragraph/link from Ford PR is emphasizing on seamlessness/transparency of the system, not on how it works or when it works.  . How in sam hill for example, can an AWD tell if it\\'s raining and the limits of grip are lower? The obvious answer is they can\\'t.Because in a low traction situation, all the wheels may be going different speeds (as picked up by ABS sensors) so the AWD system knows full well the traction level.The car can also know if the lights are on, wipers are on (especially BMWs with rain sensors) and if hte defroster/AC is on.  Because in a low traction situation, all the wheels may be going different speeds (as picked up by ABS sensors) so the AWD system knows full well the traction levelYou get a cigar. Thank you for proving my point. Systems don\\'t predict slip they measure it. The only reason the wheels are going different speeds is because they are already slipping. :shades  Next year the Fusion will have both AWD and SC. Where does that leave the Camcords? I have experienced more benefit from AWD rather then SC. Is SC control nice, and effective? Yes. But, in my neck on the woods (North East) AWD will help me more, being we have curvey roads and snow.  Fords\\' AWD system is built by Haldex, which as we all know is a part time AWD system. It is capable of sending 50% power to the rear wheels when nesessary. It is FWD biased, 100/0 on dry pavement, straight lines.Haldex differs from SH-AWD, Quattro, and Symmetrical AWD because it is part time. Is it as sophisticated at the others? No. Is it effective? Yes. Haldex is the best responding part time AWD system in the industry. The benefits are longer tire life and better gas mileage.  Again, it doesn\\'t tell you anything about the condition(s) that the system sees as having a potential to cause slippage. That is the missing piece. Good grief. It\\'s right there in black and white:use a computer controller that monitors such things as steering angle, accelerator pedal position and engine speed to provide the precise amount of torque, front to rear, as needed. They\\'re not going to publish the exact algorithm - that\\'s obviously proprietary. Suffice it to say if you\\'re cruising at 30 mph and go WOT - it will engage the rear wheels to avoid slippage. If you accelerate while turning with enough throttle and/or steering angle it will engage the rear wheels to help handling and avoid slipping in case the roads are slick. If you\\'re doing 15 mph in a parking lot at full steering lock with 10% throttle it\\'s not going to engage. Is it that hard to imagine the situations where you might have wheel slip on a slick road? That\\'s all the software is doing using the steering angle, throttle and speed indicators.  Fords\\' AWD system is built by HaldexThat was true for the Five Hundred originally, but not anymore and never for the Fusion. Ford\\'s AWD system is NOT built by Haldex. It is built in-house and is based on the Haldex system but it works differently. The Ford technology, Kurrle says, is simpler than the Haldex system because it is &#147;more electro mechanical (and) the Haldex is more of a pressure, hydraulic-based&#148; system.The fact that it\\'s electro-mechanical is what allows it to be proactive and reactive instead of only being reactive to slip.  Might want to search the original thread. I posted a link to a video that showed various ESC,DSC systems in action. Not all systems have the same capability. I would take Symmetrical AWD over PT anyday. Symmetrical AWD can send 100% power to the rear axle on launch.  It must be in white. With the webpage background being also white, I can&#146;t see it. You haven&#146;t addressed the issue, but keep repeating excerpts from the link (which shows nothing to the effect I&#146;m looking for). If it is pro-active in any way, what condition is it looking for? I haven&#146;t found anything on the subject, and apparently, that article is all you&#146;re relying on for knowledge as well. Automakers don&#146;t have to publish an algorithm to explain something that exists. It is as simple as tell when to expect the engagement.  I stand corrected, however, after reading the Ford tecnology press release, it is very very similar to Haldex. It\\'s also similar to Mazda\\'s as well.  &#147;What&#146;s really impressive about these systems is that they don&#146;t just react to slip,&#148; says Rodrigues. &#147;They usually prevent that slip from occurring in the first place. By predicting slip and preventing it, the driver doesn&#146;t feel the vehicle slipping and responding. The operation is seamless.&#148; The problem with this statement, is in the wording. What Rodrigues should have said is. By anticipating the POSSIBILITY of slip, it can prevent it. Just saying the system PREDICTS slip, gives the impression that it can detect an \"Ice patch\" on the road ahead of you, and engage the rear wheels. The system does not have ESP. Unless the \"Psychic Friends Network\" designed it.  Just saying the system PREDICTS slip, gives the impression that it can detect an \"Ice patch\" on the road ahead of youand this \\'press release\\' type of wording aggravates an already dangerous situation, folks like akirby, perhaps, that bite into this whole thing and then drive their AWD or SC equipped vehicles like madmen until, of course, he ends up in a snowbank. And you are right the computer that controls this AWD system must also know who really killed Kennedy - bet if we searched thru Ford press releases we could find the answer along with an unfulfilled promise to bring the culprit to justice.

In Consumer Reports, the difference between below average and above average is usually less than 5 percentage points over a five year period. And JD Powers\\' Long Term Reliability data shows that the most reliable cars in this segment have around 2.5 problems over a 5 year period vs below average cars in this segment having around 3.7 problems. Not a big difference. And why do you have to be so rude when you want to express yourself? I know you like Honda and their reputation for reliability despite your having to replace your transmission in your Accord. I\\'ve had two Accords so far and they have been good cars. Personally, I like Honda a lot. But with two independent organizations coming to similar conclusions about the excellent reliability of the vast majority of cars in this segment allowed me to choose a car with traits that I prefer. For me it was having extra hauling capacity in a hatchback and superior braking performance in case emergencies crept up. I also wanted something comfortable that had a good amount of power and handling that could control this power. I wanted good safety ratings too. The Mazda6 had all these things and was several thousand dollars less than the Accord or Legacy GT that made my short list. And since I thought it looked much nicer and had more direct steering, it was an easy choice. When I first started looking, Mazda was nowhere on my cars under consideration list. But keeping an open mind about what cars I\\'d consider led me to my perfect choice and after nearly 2 years of ownership I couldn\\'t be happier with my decision.Here\\'s another pic of my car:   Hey guys, let\\'s put a sock in it. Just agree to disagree. I\\'m getting tired of reading page after page of you 3 going at each other.  As someone who enjoys Backy\\'s posts, I don\\'t know how anyone could read sarcasm into that--not that I don\\'t enjoy sarcasm. .  In case this has any bearing on the subject, the 04 Explorer I had appeared to be a \"reactive\" type system. It would drive the rear wheels 100% of the time unless it detected some slip, at which point it would automatically engage four wheel drive.That said, the system worked very well. I often tested it in slippery conditions such as on gravel or loose dirt, and on wet roads. From a dead standstill, going immediately to full WOT, the rear tires would chirp only very slightly before the front tires kicked in. I would say the system was able to detect slip, transfer power, and actually obtain additional traction all in well under one second.I can see where this would be advantageous on a sedan as well.  A few replies and then I\\'ll let it drop.It senses the steering angle, the throttle position and the engine speed. Based on various combinations of those inputs it knows if you\\'re going straight or turning, accelerating or decelerating, etc. When it sees some combination of these conditions that could possibly cause slip (accelerating quickly, accelerating while turning, turning at high speed, etc.) it kicks some torque to the rear wheels JUST IN CASE. In addition to preventing POSSIBLE slip it also helps with handling. I don\\'t understand why that concept is so hard for you to understand. It\\'s common sense.  Just saying the system PREDICTS slip, gives the impression that it can detect an \"Ice patch\" on the road ahead of you, and engage the rear wheels. That\\'s because nobody in their right mind would think that a car could do such a thing in the first place and would not interpret that from the press release wording.It works as advertised - let\\'s move on.  Nice look\\'n car!! Mazda sure does a great job with their wheels. . . those are cool! :shades:  Let me recap. The discussion on AWD started with a point around its impact on fuel economy. It included my opinion on varying degree of impact based on how the AWD system works, and that permanent AWD systems (all wheels powered at all times) affect more than AWD system with a little pro-activeness built (all wheels engage under certain conditions that don&#146;t wait for slippage to occur). This in turn has greater effect than completely reactive system (all wheels engage only when slip is detected).Our argument is around whether Fusion&#146;s AWD system has a bit of pro-activeness that it will engage all wheels under non-slip conditions which is something you&#146;re suggesting. My understanding based on articles (including the one you provided) is that it is a completely reactive system.You did claim something that would put an AWD system in the middle category: &#147;Slip is most likely to occur when accelerating briskly or when cornering. Doesn\\'t mean that it will occur - just that it\\'s possible or even likely depending the road conditions. Ford\\'s AWD software senses one or both of those conditions and sends torque to the rear to AVOID a potential slip situation.&#148;The question remains, does the system being discussed do that? Does it always engage all wheels when turning, regardless of traction? Would it engage if the wheel speed sensors didn&#146;t notice any change while considering steering angle? Those will make it more like Acura&#146;s SH-AWD system which (while permanent) will redistribute torque by default and doesn&#146;t wait for slippage. I haven&#146;t seen any such claim from Ford.Besides, virtually all AWD system use some form of yaw, speed and throttle sensors to make it work.  I don\\'t understand why you can\\'t comprehend what the Ford article is saying.It sends torque to the rear BEFORE any slip is actually detected in an attempt to both prevent slip from occurring AND to improve handling. So yes, if you\\'re accelerating around a corner it will shift torque to the rear - period. It does sound very much like Honda\\'s SH-AWD but I don\\'t think it\\'s quite as sophisticated.I\\'ve posted the relevant quotes from the press release that say EXACTLY that. If you don\\'t understand them or choose to think they\\'re lying then fine. End of discussion.  \"I don\\'t understand why you can\\'t comprehend what the Ford article is saying.\"Because it\\'s a bunch of marketing mumbo jumbo designed to obfuscate the fact the it\\'s a rudimentary AWD system by today\\'s standards.   it\\'s a rudimentary AWD system by today\\'s standards. I don\\'t know if it is or is not, but it would seem to be clearly less rudimentary than the AWD systems offered on the Accord, Altima or Camry along with several other midsize sedans.It seems pretty clear that the system can engage, under certain circumstances, without slip first being detected. Akirby has clearly documented that this is claimed by Ford. Those who don\\'t believe it, I think ought to find some documentation to back-up their unsupported opinions.  It seems pretty clear that the system can engage, under certain circumstances, without slip first being detected. Akirby has clearly documented that this is claimed by Ford. And those of us who have a Ford vehicle with the new sytem, my \\'06 Explorer has it, have backed up that it does work in the way akirby describes. You can feel the main drive wheels slip ever so slightly in slippery conditions before the other two get power. There\\'s no doubt about that. However, in the case of the Explorer where you can feel the 4WD working via a slight vibration through the steering wheel when applying some throttle input, the 4WD does kick in sometimes when you never felt any slip and weren\\'t expecting it. It also stays on for a little while until it senses that all is right with the world again and it\\'s OK to shut down. This can happen at any time no matter what the road conditions are like. There are also no lights or indicators telling you what\\'s going on with the system so I\\'m guessing in the Fusion, where you most likely don\\'t feel the vibration the Explorer gives off, the switch is 100% transparent. Many times I\\'ve hit the go pedal hard to take off and the 4WD has kicked on. I know that because I could feel it. The one big thing missing from that equation though is that the rear wheels never slipped at all like they might on wet, snow covered, or gravel covered roadways. You hit the gas too hard on any of those roads the rear wheels will slip just a bit before the front wheels kick on. So somehow the onboard computer saw something it didn\\'t like about the way I was driving and felt it would help out a little. Whether I wanted it to or not.   If some of you want to twist, churn, and spin the data coming from CR and JD Powers, that is fine, and it\\'s your right to do so. However, taking a direct look and interpreting the information in a straight forward manner, the yield and results are this:There are a few above average midsize sedans in terms of long term reliability.There are quite a few AVERAGE midsize sedans in terms of longterm reliability.There are a few below average midsize sedans in regards to long term reliability.Some of you might be OK with mediocre and below vehicles.I\\'m not; I always want something that is AT LEAST above average, as a minimum.  That may well be, I did not bother to check, but if the difference, in absolute terms, between above average, average and below average is very small, then this may be a reason for not giving much weight to that factor.It was stated above that Consumer Reports and JD Powers data seem to confirm this. In Consumer Reports, the difference between below average and above average is usually less than 5 percentage points over a five year period. And JD Powers\\' Long Term Reliability data shows that the most reliable cars in this segment have around 2.5 problems over a 5 year period vs below average cars in this segment having around 3.7 problems. Not a big difference. Another thing I looked at is expected repair costs, based on edmunds data and my own information on the cost of extended warranties. Again there was not a big difference, the difference for most models was less than $100 per year. An operating cost difference of $5-10 per month is not something that would be a significant factor to me.  i agree with you totally.It becomes a problem when others are bashed, made fun of, and looked down upon as if they weren\\'t educated enough to pick the car you (not you personally, but you get it, right) chose.  So yes, if you\\'re accelerating around a corner it will shift torque to the rear - period.Now only if a Ford PR would put the words like you did. And given that it can only help market the AWD system better, I don\\'t see a reason not to! How about this...\"If the front wheels begin to turn faster than the rear wheels, as would be the case if they were spinning on snow or ice, the two hydraulic pumps would turn at a different rate and hydraulic pressure proportional to the difference in their speeds of rotation would be generated.\"Thats a marketing spin to suggest that the AWD system kicks in before the wheel spin happens. And this is from Honda\\'s Real Time AWD system used in CR-V and Element.  Except no one twisted any information. The list Backy posted does show MOST midsize being above average, that seemed fairly apparent by doing the math and observations in the real-world.   I always want something that is AT LEAST above average, as a minimum. Then you have many options to choose from.  The new Accord is a question mark for now, but CR has given it the benefit of the doubt due to its solid history. And there\\'s the Camry (I4 at least), Fusion, Milan, Sonata, Passat (V6), and others \"above average\". So quite a range of choices for different driving styles and budgets.  The problem is with that word. \"PREDICT\". I understand that the system can REACT to INPUT from steering or throttle or INPUT from wheel slip sensors. The system can only REACT to something, and not PREDICT anything. If the word \"predict\" is included in Ford\\'s description, it is misleading and false, IMO.  I\\'m sure it applies to a lot of people, but reliability ratings on CR or from JD Powers doesn\\'t govern people\\'s choice over everything else. Beyond personal experience, experiences from friends and family, preference for the type of car (soft, sporty or something in between, size), price structure/options, reputation built over time etc play a major role.Also, In my case, beyond personal experience I also happen to observe cars that are still abundant on roads while being from at least two generations out (8-plus years) vouches for their durability/reliability more than any survey could ever provide. Another way to look at is how a brand does when it comes to brand loyalty.In the longer term, it is the reality that takes over. If a brand keeps growing and sells on its name, there must be a good reason for it.  Yep. I didn&#146;t see predict in Ford&#146;s PR. It is written along the same lines as Honda&#146;s PR on Real Time AWD system. They make it sound like the system engages before slip occurs.It does happen in some systems that I have mentioned, but they are not predicting, they are just designed to engage all wheels under some conditions without requiring detection of slip. Acceleration torque control module in VTM-4 (Pilot) is an example. You accelerate, you basically engage all wheels. But it is reacting to acceleration, not predicting slippage. That is one of the conditions built in the design. I don&#146;t see something similar mentioned in any of PR from Ford.  I completely agree that ratings from any single source shouldn\\'t govern someone\\'s choice of a car. But I and others find third-party data re reliability useful. It\\'s one source, just like looking at how many cars from two generations back are seen on the road is a source of info. Each source has its plusses and minuses. For example, if you go by how many cars from two generations back are seen on the road, that favors the volume sellers (Accord, Camry, Taurus, Malibu, Century etc.) over cars that sold in lower volume. It also doesn\\'t take into account big improvements in quality and reliability by some brands over the past decade. Looking at brand loyalty has that same drawback. Personally I use a combination of long-term and shorter-term data to help with my car-buying decisions, so I don\\'t overlook a car that is a good choice now, even though two generations ago I might not have given it a moment\\'s consideration.  When looking at older cars still being abundant on the road, I do account for proportions. I don\\'t expect a Sonata from 1996 to be as common as an Accord from that period. But I do expect a Taurus and a Camry from that period to be as common. And I should have at least an occasional sighting of lower volume cars as well if they seem fairly abundant when they are launched.As far as relying on surveys from CR and JD Powers goes, I consider them, but don\\'t take them too seriously. Besides, if someone told me that a car had 2 problems per 100 sold and another had 1.5 problems per 100 sold, I would need more information than just that to really figure out what the problem really is. Both might fall under above average category, but does that by itself help?Besides, since when did we start relying on the past to create expectations around the new ones? :shades:  That is a beautiful car. Do you know if Mazda is keeping the hatchback for the new 6? I had some travel that diverted my flight about two and a half hours from home during a snow storm pretty recently, where I got a 6 for a rental. I really enjoyed driving that car for the short time I had it. Handled the snow perfectly too.  Now I\\'m confused... isn\\'t looking for how many cars from the past two generations are driving around \"relying on the past to create expectations around the new ones\", at least in part? :confuse:  You don\\'t see it because you don\\'t want to see it. Everyone else did.  I haven\\'t had trouble relying on the past and using it towards expectations for newer models.   Who\\'s everyone else?  Whatever works for you. I think it\\'s more prudent to consider the past when deciding which car to buy, but not rely on it, since the automotive market moves pretty fast and designs change--oftentimes for the better, but sometimes not.  Thats what I said. A lot more goes into buying a car than reading up CR and JDP survey, worse, taking them to the heart.  I read that 80% of Accord owners are repeat buyers. 30% of them did not even consider other cars, and just went to the Honda dealer for a new Accord. While this is telling, in it\\'s own way, what is more impressive is that 50% considered other cars, and still went back to the Accord. Seems Accord owners have a hard time finding another car (in it\\'s price range) that can measure up to what they are accustomed to.  effectively shutting their brains down to new and exciting product out there.Oh well. I\\'m glad it\\'s not me buying the hideously dull looking Camcord. Have mercy.  Didn\\'t you read the previous post?50% of the repeat Accord buyers considered other cars before going back for another Accord. Which part of that tells you that they are \"shutting down theirs brains to new and exciting products\"? :confuse:Also, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, counting out a car based on its looks is not going to gain you any credibility. Based on that thought, BMW might as well just pack up and go home...  for \"credibility\", just for starters. I have found that looking for a car is a very personal decision that can only be made by that person.IMHO the Honda Accord is one homely knight and the Toyota Camry is too. Don\\'t worry, the homeliest cars on the planet besides the Pontiac Aztek are Subaru\\'s.I\\'d rather be forced to listen to Britney Spear\\'s new CD nonstop for 250 hours at high volumes than buy a CamCord. They are hideous and not even worth considering. What\\'s nice is that there are so many choices in midsize that even if I was interested in a mid-size car I could consider a Fusion, Mazda6, Optima or a Malibu and each and every one of those would be reliable and trustworthy cars. Having to pick a CamCord would be an ugly, nasty day in paradise for me. So this is good...there are alternates to the sheep-fests out there available to one and all and they are no slouches in the price and reliability and performance variety. Not to mention price. This thread has taught me that well. It would be nice if Toyota would take some of those millions and work on designing a nice looking car. So far they are inept at it, even though the American people bail them out by buying CamCords. Go figure, Higgard.   Of course all that is in YHO. By the sales numbers, seems like Toyota has already figured out their target market and produced a product that satisifies that demand. Not to make them right and you wrong. Toyota isn\\'t for everyone and it\\'s nice to have alternatives.  I consider all brands when buying a car. I just don\\'t like Toyota and Honda\\'s midsize or large cars nor do I care for their SUV\\'s. To each his own.Now, as far as smaller cars go, I was close to buying a 2006 Scion xA in Polar White and 5-speeds. If not for my wife poo-pooing the deal I\\'d no doubt be driving one now. She didn\\'t even want to consider a Scion xA, but I enjoyed my test-drive in one and was ready to deal. Oh well. And I had my eye on a 2007 Toyota Yaris sedan for the longest time in Idaho, too. Just wasn\\'t the right time to buy on each of those rigs.I am glad I waited to trade our \\'01 Kia Sportage 4X4 in for a 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS. Oh I am so glad because this new Lancer GTS in Rally Red is a great car that I grow fonder of each passing day. But my point is that someone may love their Toyota Camry and Honda Accord and to each his own. It\\'s just that I require a lot more body design integrity than Toy-Hon offers in this size class. Plain Jane fact, man.Carry on.  Everyone except you, apparently. You seem to be the only one who can\\'t comprehend what the article said and I explained at least 3 times. If you don\\'t get it by now you never will so just move on.BTW - how does the AWD system work on the Accord, Camry and Maxima?  effectively shutting their brains down to new and exciting product out there. It is okay to have an opinion, but here is a piece of advise. Don\\'t put that on your resume, if you ever apply for a job in sales/marketing. If you make it there, I can only imagine what you would say to a long time repeat customer who has been extremely happy with the products your company sells.People aren\\'t idiots.  Haven\\'t you already? But since you asked...how does the AWD system work on the Accord, Camry and Maxima?Is there a point to the question? Or are you unaware that AWD isn\\'t offered in these cars in America?  :mad: I find that designs may change, but car companies and its employees do not, or at least they don\\'t change fast enough.Car companies in general are huge behemoths that move and change very slowly. They are gigantic goliaths that take over 50 years to figure out how to make a decent automobile sometimes...... how they stay in business for so long, I can never fathom.  I believe the vast majority of Camcord buyers are just looking for the best CAR for the money. The best value in automobiles. I don\\'t think there are really too many Camcord buyers THAT LOVE the way they look. They might like it, but not usually love it.It\\'s not the looks, it\\'s what\\'s on the indside that counts! It\\'s the way it drives, the way it moves, the way it works. The way it gets the most power and the most gas mileage at the same time. It\\'s kind of like a woman that way.... she may not be the prettiest, but she sure is the best in bed, and she won\\'t die on you prematurely. :P Guaranteed satisfaction for 15 years or 200,000 miles.   They are gigantic goliaths that take over 50 years to figure out how to make a decent automobile sometimes...So, since none of the current mid-sized car nameplates has been around for 50 years (most of them far less than that), is none of them \"decent\"?  Toyota\\'s existed in one form or another for over 50 years I believe.GM, Chrysler, and Ford have definitely existed that long.  Thank you very much! I\\'m still smitten by how my Mazda6 looks... it still makes me smile when I walk up to it; partly because I love how sleek and sensuous it looks, but probably also because I know I\\'m going to enjoy driving it. Even though my car is a couple years old, I still get lots of compliments on it. I\\'ve heard the new Mazda6 will be available in Europe as a sedan, wagon, and hatchback. But unfortunately, details on what we\\'ll get in North America haven\\'t been officially released. I hope they do though... I love how the Mazda6 hatchback is a powerful mix of great hauling capability and good looks which makes it a very unique choice in this midsize segment. I can\\'t say I was too thrilled with driving my Mazda 6 in the snow like you though. But it\\'s probably less to do with how the car handles vs how inexperienced I am at driving in snow... Portland seems to get very little snow in the last decade. But I think the biggest reason I didn\\'t enjoy driving it in the snow was because I was paranoid that I might crash my newish car!  If some of you want to twist, churn, and spin the data coming from CR and JD Powers, that is fine, and it\\'s your right to do so. However, taking a direct look and interpreting the information in a straight forward manner, the yield and results are this:There are a few above average midsize sedans in terms of long term reliability.There are quite a few AVERAGE midsize sedans in terms of longterm reliability.There are a few below average midsize sedans in regards to long term reliability.Some of you might be OK with mediocre and below vehicles.I\\'m not; I always want something that is AT LEAST above average, as a minimum.Your experience with your transmission needing to be replaced in your Accord goes to show that even cars that have been &#147;more&#148; reliable than others have significant problems. But I think in general, we agree that we both want very reliable cars. If you were to look past the overly simplistic symbols that exaggerate the differences in reliability and instead look at the percentage differences that those symbols represent in Consumer Reports reliability surveys, you&#146;ll find the difference between above average and below average to be pretty insignificant where just a matter of a few percentage points over a five year period separate the above average to below average. Now I do have some problems with the methodology of Consumer Reports reliability surveys, but their data seems to be consistent with JD Powers&#146; data where they have reported that over a five year period, the difference between the most reliable and below average cars is about one extra problem over that five year period. Personally, I don&#146;t really care if the car I buy is rated &#147;below&#148; average if the difference between below average and above average is barely statistically significant. But lets say you dismiss the small actual percentage differences between the above and below average cars and insist on buying the most reliable\\x85 well that would be the Ford Fusion.  I\\'m still smitten by how my Mazda6 looks... it still makes me smile when I walk up to it; partly because I love how sleek and sensuous it looksWould you, and your car :confuse: like to be alone? :surprise: If it were a Porsche or a Ferrari, maybe I could understand. But not a Mazda. Please.  who are you to judge what I should and should not feel? are you saying because I can\\'t afford an exotic and I need something practical, I should not enjoy driving my car or appreciate how it looks? save your snobbery and perversions for someone else. please.  While this is telling, in it\\'s own way, what is more impressive is that 50% considered other carsI would not be too impressed by this, claiming to have \"considered\" other cars does not necessarily mean much. One example is a co-worker of mine who has bought only Honda and Toyota for at least the last 15 years. I\\'ve gave him a hard time about not even considering anything else, when he was recently looking at minivans. He claimed he was considering others, yet he never even took a test drive in anything else.  who are you to judge what I should and should not feel? are you saying because I can\\'t afford an exotic and I need something practical, I should not enjoy driving my car or appreciate how it looks? save your snobbery and perversions for someone else. please.Its an CamCord thing. How could you get attached to that? Cars that have a soul facilitate a much more rewarding relationship. :P I have never been this unattached to an automobile before.  Funny you should mention I purchased a vehicle that is rated far above average (the amazing Accord), and I still experienced a few problems during warranty (all minor) not including the transmission (major). Of course, the tranny didn\\'t die until after the official warranty was over and done with, but Honda has the secret 100,000 mile warranty. So if an above average vehicle can have it\\'s fair share of issues, why in the world would I want to take a chance on a below average one? If an above average car can have 10 problems in 4 years, it stands reasonable to assume a below aveage one could just as easily have 20 problems in those 4 years. Believing you will always hit the median is a bad idea. Take a hall of fame baseball player... say.... Wade Boggs. Since he averaged close to hitting .350 for so many years, his lifetime batting average easily eclipsed .300 for his career. Now if he didn\\'t have a half dozen or so .350+ years, his average wouldn\\'t have been so high for his career. But even in his bad years he was hitting well over .300, but not always over .350. Now take your below average baseball player, and maybe he has ONE year where he can hit .300, but in most years, he\\'s very mediocre, and in some years, he might hit .220. Barely carrying his weight.I\\'ll take the Hall of Famer.  Yes, Toyota and other car companies have existed for over 50 years. But notice I was talking specifically about mid-sized cars--you know, the subject of this discussion? So much for trying to get things back on track...  I\\'ve never subscribed to Consumer Reports so I never got one of their report forms, but I understand correctly it doesn\\'t weigh for seriousness of the problem (I didn\\'t check this before posting so I\\'ll probably be corrected if I\\'m wrong). If I am correct that means your transmission counts less than a reoccurring electrical problem that cost a tenth as much to fix. The other problem with your baseball analogy is that cars have all gotten a lot better than in the past but Consumer Reports still grades on the curve. So if twenty five years ago the equivalent of 70% on a test was a gentleman\\'s C and 80 a B, 90% now gets you a C and 93% a B. In other words, every thing\\'s now better and every thing\\'s now closer together but the teacher still flunks a fixed percentage of students. In baseball parlance, sort of like the team average being .300 and the top hitter going .315.In the meantime, the Camcords have gotten progressively more conservative and less interesting. Compare a the original Sonata, a 1988 Celebrity and a 1988 Accord. Now look at the comparisons between the 08 Sonata, the 08 Malibu and the 08 Accord. Can\\'t you see that the difference is narrowing and that Honda is no longer the daring, innovative company that it was twenty years ago?  From their FAQ:...we ask subscribers to note any problems with their cars that occurred in the past 12 months. They are asked to identify problems that they considered serious (because of cost, failure, safety, or downtime). We ask them to include problems covered by warranty, but not the ones resulting from accident damage or recall. We also ask them not to include replacement of normal maintenance items (like brake pads, batteries, and mufflers) unless they were replaced much sooner or more often than expected. To me, one of the biggest weaknesses is it is too dependant on the the opinions of the person filling out the survey (eg. was the problem \"serious\"). I thought their survey was weak, when I was a subscriber long ago...I\\'ve discounted their information ever since then...meaning I don\\'t ignore it, but I also don\\'t give it too much weight.  I think CR\\'s ratings are useful, to a point. When CR had the 2001 Malibu as a \"recommended\" car, and my personal experience with that car, was far from something I would recommend. CR recommends cars, that I would not.  Is there a point to the question? Or are you unaware that AWD isn\\'t offered in these cars in America? Now that was funny. :surprise:  Personally, I don&#146;t really care if the car I buy is rated &#147;below&#148; average if the difference between below average and above average is barely statistically significant. Agree wholeheartedly.That being the case you would think the car that does it for you should be the overriding factor in your decision making.  ...but I understand correctly it doesn\\'t weigh for seriousness of the problem (I didn\\'t check this before posting so I\\'ll probably be corrected if I\\'m wrong).You are absolutely right... about being corrected if you\\'re wrong.  CR\\'s reliability ratings do weigh some problems more than others, e.g. powertrain problems carry more weight. That may explain why they un-recommended the Camry V6--it\\'s had transmission problems.  But that may not be reflected in overall reliability ratings. \"Recommendation\" is not quite the same as overall rating. Two cars may have same overall rating, but one of them may be recommended over the other.   It\\'s just that I require a lot more body design integrity than Toy-Hon offers in this size class. Plain Jane fact, man.This begs the question, why don\\'t you apply these lofty standards to other car classes then?You coveted cars such as the Scion aA and Yaris and now you drive a Lancer. Not that these cars lack style but they\\'re offensive to look at (in my opinion of course). Yaris! Yikes!!! Must be an age difference thing.   On the other hand, JD Powers does weigh problems the same.  I\\'m not sure what you\\'re trying to say, in relation to my post. If CR rates two cars the same based on their own tests, and it\\'s at least a \"Good\" score, but one has a poor crash test score and/or below average predicted reliability, than CR won\\'t recommend it but would recommend the other car, assuming it doesn\\'t have those same issues. There\\'s no mystery there--CR is very clear about under what conditions they recommend a car.Maybe if you or others want to get into a discussion about how CR rates cars in general, we should take it to the appropriate discussion, e.g. the one about CR and JD Power.  This is not the place to debate the merits or demerits of Consumer Reporst and JD Power as we\\'ve noted previously. There is a very handy discussion for that over in Smart Shopper.I want to also make the point (again) that sarcasm is not doing anything to move this conversation forward. If you have a point to make, make it, but being sarcastic about your point just makes people roll their eyes and move on - at best. It changes no one\\'s mind about the subject, but it may change some people\\'s minds about the poster. I\\'m really not sure why anyone would want to put their credibility on the line in that manner.  Anyone else besides Mazda making their cars lighter? source StoneyCreekNews-At the Frankfurt Motor Show, Mazda Motor Corporation underscores its \"Sustainable Zoom-Zoom\" vision for developing technologies that have less impact on the environment. The world premiere of the all-new Mazda6 took centre stage and this latest model continues Mazda\\'s lightweight strategy. Despite its increased dimensions and more comprehensive equipment, it is slightly lighter, uses less fuel and produces less CO2 than its predecessor.The all-new Mazda2, now on sale in Europe was the first model to break the upward spiral of ever-heavier cars.-endMy fingers are crossed that Mazda will introduce the same midsize Mazda6 in US that was introduced in Europe.  Mazda needs to do something - as all they have now is a substandard V6 and recently discontinuing the one engine that could sustain some \\'zoom-zoom\\'. Lets see the Camry SE moves 13.5lbs. of car for each HP it has - the Mazda 6 between 16 and 17 lbs. therefore all Mazda has to do is to get the 6 in at about 2800 lbs. (or about a 600lb. reduction!) and that\\'s just to match the Toyota\\'s \\'zoom\\'. Yes yes I know I\\'m missing the point - because 6 drivers are all enjoying taking corners at breakneck speeds ( or throwing themselves thru the windshield with their brakes) and never have any cause to use what is more useful - straight line power. Taking several hundreds pounds off a car in this class is not gonna happen in these days anyway, as the cars get bigger and bigger and also generally safer and safer. The new Accord and the Sonata are both classified as large cars with things like the Altima/Camry not far behind, do you really think that a 4 door sedan that can\\'t hold 4 adults comfortably is going to sell?  Geez, I hope discussing vehicle weights isn\\'t consider out of bounds.There\\'s nothing wrong with Mazda offering a fun to drive, smaller, lighter car. With VW discontinuing the Jetta 2.0t there\\'s nothing else out there unless you move up to the premium brands. I know there\\'s a VW GLI but not every one wants all the boy racer effects that come with the car. Doesn\\'t seem like Audi, Acura, BMW, or M-B have any trouble selling 4 door sedans that can\\'t hold 4 adults comfortably. Where\\'s it written that smallish 4 door sedans have to be limited to the economy or premium classes? Only in this country it appears.For pete sakes we\\'re becoming a whole bunch of fat pigs in this country. What do you think Honda meant when they said their customers are getting bigger so they made the Accord bigger?I\\'ll applaud Mazda if they hold the weight and size of the next 6.  Well I agree, except what\\'s with this ridiculous idea that 4 adults can\\'t fit comfortably in a Mazda6? The car is plenty big enough for 4 adults. Even CR said The rear is comfortable for two adults, but three is a squeeze. in their review of the 6.  Mazda needs to do something - as all they have now is a substandard V6 and recently discontinuing the one engine that could sustain some \\'zoom-zoom\\'.Not true. Going by the sticker prices you can get a MAZDASPEED6 for roughly the same price as an Accord V6 or Camry V6 and you get AWD with the Mazda to boot. Real world prices? The Mazda is cheaper than the other two making it a screaming bargain. So if you are so hung up on power and performance, which your statement eludes to, then the Accord and Camry are lame ducks compared to the Mazda6 in it\\'s current form. :P  Yes yes I know I\\'m missing the point - because 6 drivers are all enjoying taking corners at breakneck speeds ( or throwing themselves thru the windshield with their brakes) and never have any cause to use what is more useful - straight line power. That might be a regional thing. If you live in Nebraska or Kansas, or even Texas, I could see straight line acceleration as being paramount, especially I would expect one to be leaving any of those states as quickly as possible. In mountain regions, or even in Michigan where country roads wrap around property lines and farmer\\'s fields, I find having a car that can corner to be more rewarding than one that can go fast in a straight line. I also think when times are within 1 second (as the case between the new Camry and the Mazda\\'s substandard V6, power is mostly about bragging rights and not anything actually measurable anyway. Oh, and that time is with an auto, since the fuddy duddy car doesn\\'t offer a manual. Of course, even my 4 cylinder Accord feels peppy enough and has a 7 sec 0-60 w/a manual.  Rumor has it that the new engine is going to be the same 3.7 that the CX-9 has which is around 270 hp and torque. If the North American Mazda6 turns out to be like the Euro version with less weight than the current version while also increasing rigidity by some 20%, the new mazda6 could be very entertaining. That\\'s Mazdaspeed power while using regular gas. But I do wonder whether they will be able to control this much power without torque steer and whether they will offer a manual transmission with the AWD version. We should know for sure in the next couple months...As far as the current v-6 in the Mazda6, I find that the amount of power is plenty entertaining even in a straight line. I think it was MotorTrend who tested the v-6 Mazda6 in the mid-6 second range. Thing is, from a standing start, the Mazda6 leaves quite a bit to it\\'s competitors, but it revs up quickly and willingly and once into it\\'s powerband, it accelerates quite briskly. Certainly plenty enough to pass slower moving traffic with lots of time to spare. Most auto mags find that the v-6 is not at the top of the class but is still quite good and does not detract from the fun-to-drive nature of the Mazda6. Automotive.com, for example writes, \"The 3.0-liter V6 in the 6s greatly increases the fun. Like the four-cylinder, it has continuously variable valve timing (VVT) for its intake camshaft; but on the V6, this feature seems to be used more effectively, providing better low-down torque along with a willingness to rev, with good gas mileage and a nice set of sounds from the air intake and the dual exhausts. The Mazda V6 doesn\\'t feel like it has as much low-rpm torque as the Toyota and Honda V6 engines, but it loves to rev and it\\'s a lot of fun to drive.\" So of course, the Mazda6 excels in the curves where a composed chassis shows it\\'s strengths. And the Mazda6\\'s near top in class brakes both keep the driver out of trouble but also allows the driver to keep the car\\'s momentum a little longer before needing to slow down. So while all this in a family car is far from necessary, it certainly is entertaining and it may even let you release some tension from the duties of the average work day. And considering a new Mazda6 v-6 can be had in my market for 6k less than an Accord v-6, some may find it worth considering.  Would you, and your car like to be alone? If it were a Porsche or a Ferrari, maybe I could understand. But not a Mazda. Please.This from a Honda owner? What?ts an CamCord thing. How could you get attached to that? Cars that have a soul facilitate a much more rewarding relationship.Couldn\\'t have spoken it better myself. Some people actually ENJOY their time behind the wheel every day, and having a car that\\'s fun-to-drive is simply icing on the cake. I\\'ll take that over a coma-inducing CamCord anytime.  Some people actually ENJOY their time behind the wheel every day, and having a car that\\'s fun-to-drive is simply icing on the cake. I\\'ll take that over a coma-inducing CamCord anytime. I\\'ll second that! Problem is, you still have to follow them once in a while which is almost equally coma-inducing. :sick:  The only thing I have against the so called CamCords is that there are soooooo many on the road and they have that great resale value.My Optima on the other hand is quite unique so it\\'s hard to get bored with it.However...it\\'s resale value is horrible,so one can get one cheap.( why is that?)I rode in an Accord a few weeks ago, and I will admit it\\'s a little more comfortable than my KIA and the leather feels a bit softer,and the sound system is more high tech...but for the thousands less it costs,it\\'s a good trade-off.  and there you guys go harping on what\\'s cheap - when the truth is that\\'s what\\'s \\'cheap\\' (over any normal period of ownership - 5 years or less) is NOT the 6 or the Fusion or the Sonata - it is those cars that actually tend to cost more initially - like the Camcordima. Truth to the adage: you get what you pay for .And I guess since the 6 is so cheap to buy that I should be willing to accept an inferior powertrain - 4 cylinder or 6 cylinder. Those substandard engines are one the reasons that the Camcordimas cost LESS to actually own than any 6, Fulan or Sonata.  Is there a point to the question? Or are you unaware that AWD isn\\'t offered in these cars in America?Of course I\\'m aware that those cars don\\'t offer AWD. THAT WAS THE POINT.  the point was: if Mazda is going to get their \\'zoom-zoom\\' back at least with its current crop of powerplants then the 6 would have to lose about 600 lbs. and presumedly would be closer to the size of the RX8 (which really doesn\\'t have a rear seat for anybody other than kids) and that car is only about 400 lbs. lighter. As far as Ford\\'s \\'new and improved\\' 3.5 or 3.7, yes the HP would certainly solve the problem, but WHY didn\\'t Mazda do this at the same time they are discontinuing the 270hp Speed6 - or is this simply a case of \\'Fordspeak\\' at its best? The 6 is not really a high volume car so it would seem easier to have done this with the 6 as opposed to the higher volume Fulan which apparently will NOT benefit from the larger engine. Relative to what Nissan (and Honda) were doing as far back as 2002/03, the \\'zoom-zoom\\' is going to be something about 7 years late at least as far as the V6s are concerned (if it happens at all) and who knows what happens with the 4 bangers which also leave some serious HP on the table.  The constant spin about how much better, or cheaper, or more expensive the Camry or Accord are to own gets boring in this midsize discussion. Even Consumer Reports is facing reality that they have regressed to the mean and most cars vary little in realiability. JDPowers has data also. Can we just hear about the features and quality of each car without constant jumping in by the fan club for Honda and Accord. The 03 Accord was the beginning of the regression for Accord with all its problems. The 07 has shown it clearly after the previous model\\'s styling \"lack of grace\" for the Camry. So lots of people buy them anyhow. They\\'re good cars and people like them. There are many other good cars. Can we hear about those?  The constant spin about how much better, or cheaper, or more expensive the Camry or Accord are to own gets boring in this midsize discussionI agree but the facts are that it is not \\'spin\\' look it up here on Edmund\\'s or Intellichoice. And BTW your constant ragging on what is purportedly the Camry\\'s lagging reliabilities are getting boring in this forum and most importantly has nothing to do with that car\\'s actual cost to own - which I think is what we were talking about ( is something like a Mazda6 really a better buy just because the mfgr. is having to float big discounts on them).  While the cost differences may be smaller for those who trade frequently, cars such as the Mazda6 do still cost less over a 3 or 5 year ownership period. I\\'ve compared the Accord to the Mazda6 in 4 cylinder automatic form a number of times...I\\'ll do it again with the 2008s... The 2008 Maxda6i sport value has invoice of $19,671 and a $1000 cash to dealer incentive (or discount financing). So one could easily buy one for $18,671. The expected resale value according to edmunds is $11,558 after 3 years and $8755 after 5. So net 3 year cost is $7113 and for 5 it is $9916. (I had to use the 2007 for resale, as they have not yet put up 2008 figures)The 2008 Accord LX-P has invoice of $20,720. Its resale, per edmunds, is $12,744 after 3 years and $9553 after 5. So net cost is $7976 for 3 years and $11,167 for 5.So in this comparison the Mazda6 will cost around $250 to $290 per year less. If we want to account for every penny, we can add about $70 per year to that, as that is what one can earn right now on the $2070 initial cost difference. So that puts the difference at $320 to $360. Since most people buy cars on credit, a perhaps more realistic comparison is the Mazda6 for $19,671 financed at 3 years 1.9% (that is the alternative to the $1000). The total payments come to $20253, so net cost is $8695. For the Accord I\\'ll assume 6.5% for 3 years, this puts total at $22,862 and net is $10,118. So in this case the Mazda6 costs $1423 (or $474 per year) less. In percentage terms the Accord costs 16% more, based on this estimate.  Yes intellichoice...maybe a beter name would be ignoramachoice. This is the site that gives a target price of $19,320 for a 2007 Mazda6 that invoices at $19,076 and has a $2500 rebate. Anyone can buy that car for $16,576 or less. So yes, I guess if you pay $2744 more than even the feeblesest non-negotiator could get by simply emailing 2 or 3 dealers, then you probably will do better buying an accord or camry.  cars such as the Mazda6 do still cost less over a 3 or 5 year ownership period.well, since I\\'m not one to keep a car more than about 3 or 4 years, please SHOW ME some sort of support for that because I think that the Intellichoice/Edmund\\'s costs are projected over a 5 year time period. I would suggest to you that there isn\\'t a soul on this forum that wouldn\\'t prefer to save a few grand on a car if that car is a good alternative to something more expensive and it holds that advantage over time. As they say in Missouri - show me?  >purportedly the Camry\\'s lagging reliabilities are getting boring in this forumI will keep posting the facts.Since you mentioned the CR dropping the recommendation for the Camry I looked back through and don\\'t find I\\'d mentioned that in this discussion. I have pointed out other short-comings like rental/fleet sales to bolster sales. It is a hard fact to accept that CR has lowered rating because of problems. If you want to talk about ownership costs you must include the hard packs the local dealer puts on the sale of their cars because they are considered by some as the only car they can buy and therefore they must buy. That increases the purchase cost despite any discounts allegedly made. A pack of $999 for mudflaps and couple of other options with a mandatory documentation fee of up to $600 on a sticker in the showroom and who knows what other packs are added after the customer feels commited to a price before they get to the final line. Those don\\'t happen at the dealer for other brands because their customers feel less mandated to purchase the car with high reliability.Add on the extra service they mandate under threat of warranty not being honored and you are up to a higher cost of ownership despite the --current, at last-- higher resale value if the owner sells straightout. Tradein values probably run into the \"it\\'s 3 years old and there\\'s not much value to them\" when the salesman evaluates the trade-in.   please SHOW ME some sort of support for thatUhh, I just did that at length in the post you responded to...read past the first sentence, it\\'s post number 7168...hope that helps.  and while I\\'ll agree that Intellichoice (or Edmunds) can not and do not forecast whatever \\'special\\' is running any given week - it is also true that if the market price is overstated by $2744 (your example) so is the resale value overstated - by a similar amount. Therefore the gross dollars lost (and the cost-to-own) remain about the same. The bottom line is that as soon as Mazda has to start offering $2500.00 rebates - that the chances are that the earlier buyers of that car that didn\\'t perhaps receive the benefits of Mazda\\'s largesse also took a $2500.00 hit. It is never good to see anything you bought go on \\'sale\\' especially if you expect to sell it later. And yes, the 07 Accord was sold for awhile at some very \\'un-Honda-like\\' prices (to make room for the 08s) and those folks that bought that car earlier in the year took a hit as well. Economics 101.  as often noted in this forum - repairs costs for the most reliable of these cars vs. those repairs for the worst are NOT much different if we are considering new cars purchased and kept 3 to 5 years. There is negligible impact, therefore, on \\'cost to own\\' as none of these cars should have any large repair costs. Again, we are talking cost to own here - not how bad you think that Toyota\\'s reliability is getting.  As far as Ford\\'s \\'new and improved\\' 3.5 or 3.7, yes the HP would certainly solve the problem, but WHY didn\\'t Mazda do this at the same time they are discontinuing the 270hp Speed6 - or is this simply a case of \\'Fordspeak\\' at its best? Originally, the new Mazda6 was supposed to be a 2008, but, Mazda pushed back the launch date here in NA. The new Mazda6 is out in Europe and Japan. The Speed6 was only slated for a 2yr-12,000 unit production run. Since the Speed6 was also built in Japan, in the same factory in Hofu that is now building the new Mazda6 for Japan and Europe, Mazda cannot continue to build it, for they no longer produce that body style. Many think, Mazda will introduce a new Mazdaspeed6 once they finalize r&d. But, for now, they are concentrated on the regular production Mazda6, in which, according to Mazda, this is very big for them for it\\'s showing the \"evolution\" of the first car to emphasize the \"zoom-zoom\" philosophy.  Originally, the new Mazda6 was supposed to be a 2008, but, Mazda pushed back the launch date here in NA. I undertsand your point about The new Mazda6 is out in Europe and Japan.Hmm - \\'supposed to\\' and \\'pushed a launch date back\\', etc. etc. Is this Mazda speak or Ford speak?. Correct me if I\\'m wrong - The \\'good\\' V6s (in the 6) are not available anywhere yet (in Europe Japan or the US), true? And nobody knows yet what\\'s going to happen to the poor Fusion (engine wise), true? Why should I believe Mazda/Ford when they can\\'t seem to do anything they promise (except close plants) , I believe the HP deficit in the Fusion was \\'promised\\' to be fixed for the 2008 MY, true?  Sorry, but no. Intellichoice has target price of $19,320 and depreciation at $11,232 leaving resale of $8088. If you take another $2744 off of that it would be $5344. You are not going to buy a 5 year old Mazda6 in good condition with a normal amount of miles on it for $5344, the $8088 looks to be pretty close to reality.The 2007 Mazda6 had a $2000 rebate pretty much right from the start (as of November 2006). The rebates on the 2007 Mazda6 did not vary much at all throughout the sales year.  The Mazda6 never had a V6 available anywhere but in the US.  I find having a car that can corner to be more rewarding than one that can go fast in a straight linewhile I happen to agree with you, personally I would suggest to you that that \\'straight line\\' capability is what most drivers will find more useful whether its passing a semi on a 2 lane or merging on the highway that happens to be moving at 80! That old DT engine does leave about 50hp on the table.  Hmm - \\'supposed to\\' and \\'pushed a launch date back\\', etc. etc. Is this Mazda speak or Ford speak?. Unsure. Could be a combo of both?Correct me if I\\'m wrong - The \\'good\\' V6s (in the 6) are not available anywhere yet (in Europe Japan or the US), true?Only NA got the V6 in the Mazda6. Everywhere else in the world got 4cyl gas and diesel engines, or the 4 cyl turbo. North America will be the only region to get a V6 this time around as well. Remember, gas prices everywhere else in the world are 10 times worse then we have it here. Rumor has it that the North American Mazda6 will also have Mazda\\'s Active Torque-Split AWD system, as late availability.Why should I believe Mazda/Ford when they can\\'t seem to do anything they promise (except close plants) What has Mazda promised that was not delivered? What plants has Mazda closed? You keep forgetting that Mazda does run their company differently then Ford does. They have two different CEO\\'s, they are two different companies. They are not the same. Saying they are states ignorance.I believe the HP deficit in the Fusion was \\'promised\\' to be fixed for the 2008 MY, true? I never heard that. What does the Fusion have to do with the upcoming Mazda6?  exactly - so the original poster can talk all about \\'the new 6 available in Europe and Japan\\' but it is still an underpowered vehicle relative to what is available in THIS country meaning V6s. Ever since the MX5/Probe days back in the late 80s and early 90s the Mazdas have always had \\'Ford\\' Vulcan and DT V6s - something that I contend has hurt the Mazda6 ( and 626) in the showrooms. It sure has kept me away.  I believe the HP deficit in the Fusion was \\'promised\\' to be fixed for the 2008 MY, true?The Fusion was never targeted for any new regular engines for 2008. The hybrid was targeted for the 08 model year when it debuted 2 years ago but that got pushed back to 09 (next fall).  While Ford has had a history of delayed product launches and being slow to market, a lot of the current delays are a direct result of improved management reversing earlier bad decisions. As an example, the 09 Fusion was supposed to get an improved 3.0L engine instead of the 3.5L due to supply issues. It has now been confirmed that the 3.5L engine program will be accelerated (more plants converted sooner) and the 3.0L improved engine has been all but cancelled (except maybe for the Escape). This may delay things a bit but the end result will be right.You can\\'t expect Ford\\'s new management to fix 10 years of mismanagement in just over a year.  I agree with akirby on this one. I think I was the one who originally reported the rumor of the PIP Duratec30 being slated for the Fusion and Escape. That has since changed and sources on other forums are confirming the D35 for the Fusion in \\'09 along with a facelift and new interior (Still the PIP D30 for the Escape though as the D35 does not fit apparently). Other engine choices for \\'09 that are being thrown around include the new 2.5L I4 and a TwinForce I4 making near 280 HP with excellent FE. Those engines along with the gen II hybrid system and the D35 do give the consumers a lot to choose from when shopping for a Fusion. I\\'m not sure why they would offer the TF in anything but an SVT though. Seems like it would steal sales from the D35 copies as it should have more power and better FE than the V6.  While folks like to talk endlessly about V6 which makes for a fine marketing statement, the reality lies with success of I-4 power. That fact has long been ignored by GM, Ford and Chrysler. But there appears to be an end in sight. For the first time, GM seems to be paying more respect to the power of four-cylinder engines, expecting more than half of Malibu to be equipped as such. I also remember reading that Aura will get the I-4 as well. Honda expects 50% of Accord sales to be EX/EX-L trim, then there are LX/LX-P trims. Clearly, V6 is expected to be a niche. Just see how many Camry V6 or Altima V6 you can spot on the road. Usually, if I-4 is good enough, people will overlook V6. Besides, saving an mpg or two won&#146;t go out of fashion. In fact, it will be very much in fashion. Hence the rush to improve EPA ratings by hook or by crook (whether it all translates to reality, remains to be seen).  well , let\\'s see here - if you really don\\'t think that Ford\\'s financial problems do effect Mazda\\'s ability to to fulfill its promise for a better V6 in the 08 6 (you said so yourself) OR if you don\\'t think that the 6 and the Fusion are close to identical mechanically then I guess the marketing people did their job. I personally have owned a number of Mazdas and even a Probe and have always thought that Mazda has been a good product that has been hurt by Dearborn.  Of course I\\'m aware that those cars don\\'t offer AWD. THAT WAS THE POINT. And that wasn&#146;t the point of discussion around AWD. You might want to revisit \"facts\". I\\'m not interested in discussing Ford\\'s commercials.  You forgot the most important thing about having \"zoomzoom\" handling in Michigan - pothole avoidance!  and one would think that with $5 gas on the horizon that even more of these engines will be 4 bangers. When was the last time that \\'Detroit\\' made a good 4 banger, anyway? While they may be paying some attention to things like that now (as you contend) - which \\'Detroit\\' 4 bangers are you going to consider equal to the \\'Japanese\\' efforts today (or in the near future)?  I think the Ecotec 2.4L must be pretty good. It\\'s not as sweet sounding as a Honda though!  Four cylinder engines have always been a challenge for GM/Ford/Chrysler. It also shows in their reluctance to compete with entry level cars with smaller and more fuel efficient engines. They will usually slap bigger engines to make up for it and sell power.For most part, they still believe in bragging about V8 (and to a lesser extent, V6). The priorities are messed up. On the marketing front, even if a V6 manages to deliver as good mileage as an I-4 (the Malibu/Aura V6, based on history, won&#146;t be a candidate for it), people perceive differently. It could be from experience though, because more often than not, what we compare is EPA rating, and not real world fuel economy.My recent research into certified used RAV4 revealed some of that. 100% of relatively new RAV4 (from up to 2 years old) were V6 powered. I couldn&#146;t find a single I-4 powered RAV4 in my area. It only indicates to me that many bought V6 powered version looking at EPA rating but were either disappointed or scared to keep it home. They can&#146;t be fleet returns either because, based on my experience, virtually all fleet RAV4 have four bangers.Another interesting option on the horizon is diesel. And with $5/gallon, it is only going to get more interesting. And at least one from Detroit (Bob Lutz) is downplaying it and considers it a ridiculous option. IMO, we\\'re looking at history repeating itself.  if you really don\\'t think that Ford\\'s financial problems do effect Mazda\\'s ability to to fulfill its promise for a better V6 in the 08 6 (you said so yourself) I never said why the launch of the new Mazda6 was not on par with the rest of the world, because I do not know. No one does. You are forgetting that Mazda makes it\\'s own money, and spends it own money. Do we really know if Ford\\'s financial status effects what Mazda does in Japan? According to rumors, the only real difference from the Euro/Japanese Mazda6 will be the V6 engine. Now, is Mazda going to use the 3.7 sourced from Japan, or the 3.5 sourced from the U.S.? We don\\'t know. Also, did Mazda push back the launch of the 6 so it did not clash with the Accord? That is another rumor. If that were true, it\\'s a good thing they did that. In this segment, you want to make the biggest splash upon arrival. The Accord most certainly did that. Then there is the AWD speculation. With the CX\\'s selling strong, and demand increasing, AWD systems are scarce.if you don\\'t think that the 6 and the Fusion are close to identical mechanically then I guess the marketing people did their jobThe current 2003-2008 Mazda6 and Ford Fusion are very similar. Same Mazda platform, and engine choices. The D23 is a Mazda design, and the D30 is Ford\\'s. Tranny\\'s are different as well as suspension/materials/design. The up-comming Mazda6 uses a Volvo platform, recently used in the new Ford Mondeo in Europe. If you have not seen the Mondeo, you need to take a look. Whatta car that is. In Europe, Ford\\'s have a strong reputation for reliability and quality.  Grad- think you will have a hard time finding anybody that doesn\\'t know that Honda makes and has made the best small engines for many years. I was thinking more about a comparison of that Ecotec (or Hyundai\\'s/Chrysler\\'s \\'world engine\\'/Ford-Mazda\\'s 2.3s) you mentioned to the Nissan and Toyota 4 bangers which are not shabby either. I wouldn\\'t even think of comparing a Honda engine (4 banger) to pretty much anything else made on this planet - their expertise in building a small engine is legendary and why they make such good lawnmowers  !  Not sure what your point is, do you expect Mazda to put a V6 in the new 6 for the rest of the world, where no one wants this?To me rather than underpowered engines in the rest of the world, I would say that only in the US do over-powered FWD family sedans sell. As was pointed out the majority of buyers of the two (maybe 3?) most popular midsize sedans have found the 150-170 HP 4 cyl to be adequate for the job. You have a fixation on V6 and HP that most buyers don\\'t seem to share, in the end.  This topic just keeps getting funnier (and more ignorant) as it keeps moving along!personally I would suggest to you that that \\'straight line\\' capability is what most drivers will find more useful whether its passing a semi on a 2 lane or merging on the highway that happens to be moving at 80!I happen to drive a lot of two-lane roads and highways as part of my commute and with weekend jaunts. Not once, and I\\'ll repeat, NOT ONCE has my V6-equipped Mazda6 let me down when I needed more power, both in the instances you just described, and in thousands of other situations when I needed to get up and go. 50 HP may mean something on paper, but where it counts ON THE ROAD, the difference is negligible at best.Ever since the MX5/Probe days back in the late 80s and early 90s the Mazdas have always had \\'Ford\\' Vulcan and DT V6s - something that I contend has hurt the Mazda6 ( and 626) in the showrooms. It sure has kept me away.No. What\\'s hurt the Mazda6 in showrooms is the fact that it\\'s 9/10th the size of the behemoth CamCords. Since the vast majority of this segment buys I-4\\'s and avoids the V6, AFAIC the V6 is not an issue, nor will it be when the \\'09 model debuts.I personally have owned a number of Mazdas and even a Probe and have always thought that Mazda has been a good product that has been hurt by Dearborn.As proven on this forum about a thousand times now, MAZDA AND FORD ARE TWO DIFFERENT COMPANIES. Different philosophies, different management teams, etc. And also as repeated before, Mazda WOULD NOT EXIST had it not been for Ford purchasing a share of their stock and investing some much-needed $$$$. It\\'s not a marketing \"scheme\", it\\'s no joke, or \"Fordspeak\", its FACT. Whether or not you choose to believe it is your choice, but don\\'t bash something that you obviously know nothing about and are too ignorant to understand fully.  According to rumors = Ford/Mazda speak.of course the \\'new\\' Mazda6 would be based on some sort of Volvo platform - Ford already did that with the S80/500-Taurus - not that platform sharing is necessarily bad or unusual - if the platform is good enough - the majority of Nissan/Infiniti models are all based in some degree on what they call the \\'FM\\' platform, and quite successfully. From what I understand Ford Europe is the only wholly owned Ford subsidiary that actually makes money (Rover?) . I don\\'t know much about the Mondeo as I also understand that it is not destined for the US but I do read that it is a helluva car...  The up-comming Mazda6 uses a Volvo platform, recently used in the new Ford Mondeo in Europe.Besides your dealer connections, where else did you get this info. A number of other sources, including automotive journalists across the pond, say that the \\'09 6 is based on a revised version of the current platform.link here  You might want to revisit \"facts\". I\\'m not interested in discussing Ford\\'s commercials.Just because you can\\'t comprehend the \"facts\" about how Ford\\'s AWD system works doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a \"commercial\". The system works as advertised by sending torque to the rear wheels to help handling and to help prevent slip from occurring under certain conditions. End of discussion. Move on.  Haven\\'t you noticed that the people who complain the most about Ford (and Mazda) are the ones that know the least about them?  If Ford and Mazda are different companies then why are they producing cars that except for a few inches and some suspension bits are otherwise identical?. Or FTM, why, if they are different companies, does Mazda seem to have the same sort of problems getting a competitive V6 in the car? I don\\'t know for a FACT (as you say) what kind of financial condition that Mazda was in back in the late 80s when Ford commissioned them to build the new Mustang (later became the Probe) , the only thing that seems to be apparent to this Mazda fan is that Ford ( and perhaps its financial problems) is \\'holding back\\' what used to be an innovative car mfgr.  According to rumors = Ford/Mazda speak. I have gathered rumors from forums, magazines, and from what my rep\\'s at Mazda have hinted to. I really only take what my rep says seriously. I cannot get any of my Mazda hierarchy to spill the beans on what they plan to do, officially. Does this mean they don\\'t know what going on? No. It just means they are not ready to let everyone know what they are up to. What\\'s wrong with that? Every company does that.  OK I\\'ll bite, akirby, than you tell me what I have said in the last several posts that is inaccurate -outside of that contradictory information that you might glean from that unimpeachable source - the FoMoCo press releases. A challenge if you will....  Yes, Aura gets an I4 for 2008. Another example of increased emphasis on I4s in mid-sized cars is the availability of an I4 on the Sonata on all trim lines for 2008, even the top-end Limited. The power increase for the I4 planned for early next year (2009 MY) should help increase the popularity of the I4 Sonata vs. V6 even more. Also, with increased emphasis on I4s and fuel economy, that could bode well for the \"upsized\" compact sedans like Elantra and Sentra that have mid-sized interiors, but only I4 engines.  If Ford and Mazda are different companies then why are they producing cars that except for a few inches and some suspension bits are otherwise identical?. Other then the Escape/Tribute, B-Series/Ranger, which are identical? The Fusion and Mazda6 are similar, but not identical. Really, nothing else in the line are even close to identical! Other then platform sharing, which is done between \"global partners\", there are no similarities. Nissan/Infinity share platforms with parent company, Renault, which no one ever seems to talk about. I have not heard many good things about that company, but, people here seem to stay away from that debate because Renault does not import to the US anymore.  this bit of \\'info\\' came from \\'aviboy\\' #7191, but it does make some sense given that Ford is already borrowing from Volvo for other products.  Renault (the French government?) did dump a few billion into Nissan back in the 90s,it effectively was Carlo Ghosn (the man in charge at the time), the money, and the 2002 Altima (FM platform) that helped Nissan develop what supposedly is THE most profitable product line of any mfgr. (in terms of profit/unit - not overall (I think Toyota has that sewn up)) and a lot of that has to do with that platform/drivetrain sharing that we were talking about.As far as Renault cars go, I seem to remember some pretty sorry vehicles with that name (or cars built by Renault and imported by somebody else) - Nissan OTH something quite different.  then all you would have to do is take your 6 back for trade (or advertise it in the paper) and see how close to reality it is, wouldn\\'t you? Have heard many trade-in horror stories from 6 owners - especially the ones that paid the premium for the Speed6. The fact that the 07 6 had a \\'built-in\\' $2000.00 rebate would indeed serve to stabilize resale prices and reminds me a bit of how Buick markets their cars.  I think we\\'re on the same page - maybe a frightening prospect in itself  and also agree that Detroit may miss the boat if they don\\'t get on the small 4 cyl (or V6) diesel bandwagon - the future is not likely going to be in skirting EPA FE requirements with cheap to produce but costly to operate E85 vehicles. Wonder how many folks out there bought that \\'Flex-fuel\\' on the trunk and then have never had any occasion to use it!  outside of that contradictory information that you might glean from that unimpeachable source - the FoMoCo press releases.Why don\\'t YOU point out where FoMoCo press releases provide contradictory information?  We\\'ve been there. And sometimes it may not appear to be contradictory, just misleading. We have been there too.   didn\\'t think you would accept the challenge but to answer yours - I don\\'t read press releases because I think that nobody in their right mind should ever believe them - from anybody! And yes, that whole thing about a system on any vehicle that is NOT reacting to something is typical of PR BS, not to mention a number of PRs dated back in 05 that \\'promised\\' the DT3.5 in the Five Hundred.  That is such a ridiculous statement that I\\'m not even going to respond.Let\\'s talk about the vehicles.  Well, no I\\'d have to wait 4.5 years for mine to reach that 5 year old status first  and even then mine won\\'t really be a good barometer as I\\'ll probably have less than 50K mi in 5 years. I\\'m not a trader anyway, so not likely I\\'ll be looking into that just for the sake of posting about it here.I agree that certainly anyone who paid list or even invoice for a speed6 will be experiencing horrible trade in value. 2007 buyers of that got huge discounts, or were very foolish if they did not. I had read that Mazda was going to try to reduce incentives. In 2006 I think they had started at around $2k and ramped up to about $4K, I believe. So 2007 was quite different. In 2007 they also created the sport value package, which was reduced quite a bit in price from the most comparable model the previous year...I think it lost a spoiler and fog lights and price was reduced by around $2K.  Isn\\'t GM also getting away from limiting you to 4 speed auto in the 4 cylinders? This is another indicator of increased emphasis on the I4.Mazda (and presumably Ford???) are also upgrading the 4 cyl. They are going to a 2.5 L, with ~170 HP, I believe.  Detroit may miss the boat if they don\\'t get on the small 4 cyl (or V6) diesel bandwagon I will agree with that as well. 4 cyl and diesel engines seem to be the future, especially the way fuel prices are jumping. While V6 power is nice, and great to talk about in comparo\\'s, the reality is, a higher % of mid sized sedans will be sold as 4 cyl\\'s. When these companies can build a powerful diesel that meets Cal Emissions standards here in the US, I\\'m sure they will be in serious demand, like how hybrids were a few years ago.I have heard VW is about to import their newest diesel here. Mazda is working on one that they already sell in Europe.  So 2007 was quite different. In 2007 they also created the sport value package, which was reduced quite a bit in price from the most comparable model the previous year...I think it lost a spoiler and fog lights and price was reduced by around $2K. Yes, this year Mazda reduced the price with the intro of the Sport Value Edition, about $2,000 then the Sport package from 2006. Also, in 2006 there was a peak of $4,000 in rebates. This year, only $2,000 at model year end.  a TRUE story whether you choose to believe it or not:In the spring of 05 was shopping for a sedan to be my personal driver: things like a TL, G35, Avalon, Maxima, 300 and Five Hundred were all interviewed. Down here in Texas we have things called feeder roads that parallel the highways with many businesses including car dealerships directly accessing that feeder road. The problem is that the traffic on these feeders moves at or about the same speed as the highway. Since there is usually lots of traffic on these roads, 0-60 (or 5-60) becomes very important in any car to safely \\'get up to speed\\' or \\'merge\\'. Well, I had just got done test driving a Maxima and Avalon and then tried this in a Five Hundred which really did impress me on the showroom floor - I mistakenly anticipated similar power out of the Ford because the other 2 cars were leaving rubber and getting up to speed quite nicely. I almost got killed (literally) and just couldn\\'t wait to get the thing back to the dealership - at which point - the sales manager hearing my complaints hands me something on Ford\\'s letterhead telling me all about an improved engine for that car due within 6 months and asked me if I consider waiting. The answer to that was no, of course but it now seems like Ford was circulating its \\'lies\\' even amongst its own employees, it was 3 years not 6 months. Wish I still had the PR. In any case, I\\'ve had this thing ever since about Ford and its promises, the real value of what should be excessive power (or lack thereof) in cars like this, and particularily the DT 3.0 ever since.PS - what ridiculous statement? I believe I made 2 in that particular post and I also assume that everything I say is ridiculous in any case :P  my only wish is that these diesels are more like 200-250hp and 300-400 lb ft. so that much of the slowness (these cars are indeed getting quite large) that I personally find objectionable is minimized. The increased FE, whatever the HP is, is what its all about, of course and as long as the premium in cost is recoverable in a reasonable period of time - how can you not like the prospect of these new diesels? .  while I happen to agree with you, personally I would suggest to you that that \\'straight line\\' capability is what most drivers will find more useful whether its passing a semi on a 2 lane or merging on the highway that happens to be moving at 80! That old DT engine does leave about 50hp on the table.While it\\'s true that the engine in the Mazda6 is rated at least 50 hp less than the Accord, Edmonds just tested the v-6 Accord w/ a manual transmission and found it\\'s 0-60 time was 6.3 seconds. The Altima\\'s 0-60 time was 6.2 seconds. MotorTrend found the Mazda6 v-6 with a manual to be 6.4 seconds. Car and Driver tested the Mazda6 at 6.7 seconds. Most everyone have noticed that from a complete stop the Mazda6 is not the quickest off the line but it makes up time as it revs higher where there\\'s more torque. So that suggests that from a rolling start, the Mazda6 would out-accelerate the Accord. Probably top end speed would be higher in the Accord in case there are some people out there who think driving faster than 125 mph is a good idea :confuse: Perhaps I\\'m reading too much into this data, but it seems when you say the Mazda6 has a huge power defeceit I\\'d have to say that the difference in acceleration is minor so what\\'s the significance? For many thousands less than the $6000 price difference between the Accord and the Mazda6 I can get stickier tires, lighter wheels and a cold air intake and likely improve my 0-60 times by a few tenths. What was also interesting in the Edmunds review was their comments on the Accord\\'s braking system... they wrote, \"The Accord\\'s four-wheel discs and tires produced only one good stop from 60 mph with an effort of 128 feet, and the car\\'s stopping distances grew as the brakes heated and faded noticeably. The third quarter-mile run at more than 100 mph was particularly memorable, as the brake system couldn\\'t generate enough brake pressure to lock the tires sufficiently to even elicit a response from the ABS. Yikes.\" Not the car I\\'d like to be driving going around the twisty roads! Imagine heading toward a corner and finding your brakes have faded.... definitely one area that I\\'d have to modify if I bought an Accord.  Edmonds just tested the v-6 Accord w/ a manual transmission and found it\\'s 0-60 time was 6.3 seconds. The Altima\\'s 0-60 time was 6.2 seconds. MotorTrend found the Mazda6 v-6 with a manual to be 6.4 seconds. Car and Driver tested the Mazda6 at 6.7 seconds. Most everyone have noticed that from a complete stop the Mazda6 is not the quickest off the line but it makes up time as it revs higher where there\\'s more torque. So that suggests that from a rolling start, the Mazda6 would out-accelerate the Accord.Edmunds typically has slower runs that those car magazines you mention. Case-in-point:Motor Trend numbers for 2003-2005 Camry and Accord: 8.5 seconds to 60MPH, 9.5 seconds to 60MPH. Both are 4-cylinder models.Edmunds has the same cars (2005 models instead of 2003 like in Motor Trend). They quote the acceleration numbers at 9.5 and 10.3 for Accord and Camry, in that order.So, to compare Motor Trend or C&D to Edmunds, you really need to take into account Edmunds\\' tendencies to get times slower by around one second to 60 MPH.I\\'ll look at numbers from the SAME source a lot more closely. Different sources will offer HUGE variables, as in the example I provided.Most everyone have noticed that from a complete stop the Mazda6 is not the quickest off the line but it makes up time as it revs higher where there\\'s more torque. So that suggests that from a rolling start, the Mazda6 would out-accelerate the Accord.Um, no it doesn\\'t. (Correct me if I\\'m not following your logic)It means that it has more meager low-end power, and it improves with higher revs. The Accord\\'s power is more than ample at the low-end, but it improves with higher revs just like the Mazda. The Accord has more top-end power than the Mazda, so it would out-accelerate the Mazda.I\\'m not a drag racer (I have a 4-cyl vehicle), but I couldn\\'t help but chime in since it was brought up.  So you\\'re saying the Accord\\'s 0-60 time in Motortrend will be 5.3 seconds? Yeah, I\\'ll take that bet...  a few things - first, acceleration times from different sources on different vehicles are NOT comparable - second, it is that higher torque of the Honda engine applied over time (also called HP) that means it must outaccelerate the Mazda (other factors equal) and lastly the other factors aren\\'t really equal - the new Accord (which I assume is the one you are talking about) is in a different category size (and weight) wise.  manual tranny and a little car abuse - I would be willing to take 5.8 or so - 5.3 OTH is really really quick.  Never said that so you\\'ll be betting against yourself. Quit putting words in my mouth zzzoom6. I would be they\\'ll be a bit quicker than 6.3. I pointed out the vast differences possible from two sources in acceleration times due to conditions, drivers, and launch methods being different.My personal bet is 5.6-6.0 sec. The 240hp 2003 Accord coupe with a 6MT ran it in 5.9. I think a mid-upper 5sec time is reasonable if a 5.1 second time can come from a 306hp 3500lb Lexus IS350 from C&D.  yeah, 12hp/lb. is in a different category than even the 13-14 for the other \\'quick\\' cars of this group. However, 5.1 for the IS?? Consider the source - C&D....  bottom line: getting from 0-60 in 6 and change seconds is plenty fast for a family car and can be very entertaining especially if one is inclined to have fun when driving. dog the engine in the Mazda6 all you like, but those who have reviewed the Mazda6 in car mags tend to find the car very entertaining and quite comfortable. And with the prices available on this car, it is a great value. I saw an ad last week for a Mazda6 w/ a v-6 and an automatic for 17k... Having driven the Mazdaspeed6, more power would be a welcome addition to the 6 as the chassis has so much grip, it could handle more power without problems. But after taking the Speed6 around some familiar roads that are twisty, I came to the conclusion that yeah, the Speed6 was quicker, but the v-6 in my car was still very fun and I loved the utility of the hatchback design that I could not get in any other car in this segment including the Speed6 so I contentedly walked away from a great deal from the dealership on the Speed6. Who says you need 260+ HP in a car to be considered fun to drive or safe... this whole line of reasoning is just a strawman argument: making a big deal out of something that is really not that important. Especially when you remember that there is a Mazda6 that has more power... the Mazdaspeed6. And I bet you can get this car for less than a v-6 Accord w/ a manual transmission.  and there would be those that contend that 0-60 in 8 something with a 170hp 4 banger is plenty fast enough as well - and relative to those cars available to us even 10 short years ago - those that would say that are absolutely right!  the graduate writes: Quit putting words in my mouth zzzoom6. the graduate \"imposter\" also wrote: you really need to take into account Edmunds\\' tendencies to get times slower by around one second to 60 MPH. no, I\\'m just putting your words back in your mouth. ok, you did say \"tendencies\" which gives you some wiggle room, but I just took your argument to it\\'s extreme which I\\'ll admit is a bit unfair. Actually I was surprised that the Altima and Accord didn\\'t break into the 5\\'s so you\\'re probably right. But the argument that you need a car to have 0-60 times in the 5\\'s or even 6\\'s to be safe or to be able to have fun is ridiculous. Yes, the Mazda6 v-6 engine is less powerful than most v-6\\'s in this segment, but it is still fun, safe, and fast (relatively of course... maybe I should say faster than 90% of the cars on the road anyway).  Especially when you remember that there is a Mazda6 that has more power... the Mazdaspeed6. And I bet you can get this car for less than a v-6 Accord w/ a manual transmission. Good point. Even though the MS6 has been discontinued for now, it is still on sale, as there are a few still out there.  Yes, the Mazda6 v-6 engine is less powerful than most v-6\\'s in this segment, but it is still fun, safe, and fast (relatively of course... maybe I should say faster than 90% of the cars on the road anyway). I\\'m not saying it isn\\'t... like I said, my 4-cylinder pulling in the low-8s for 0-60 is still plenty quick for me.  But the argument that you need a car to have 0-60 times in the 5\\'s or even 6\\'s to be safe or to be able to have fun is ridiculous.Maybe I am just an old fuddy-duddy but 0-60 times are probably the least important, to me, aspects of the mid-size sedan equation just so long as the times are not measured with a calendar.Our 3.0-liter V6 Duratec in a 2007 AWD SEL Fusion delivers fully adequate acceleration under all circumstances. It\\'s no jack rabbit but it\\'s not a snail either. I just don\\'t get the 0-60 argument as a basis to evaluate the mid-size sedans.  0-60 is one of the least useful stat outside of drag racing. And traction upon launch (key word) is big thing. This is also why trap speed is far more representative of engine\\'s power than ET.A person recently ran an almost new (1000 mile on the odometer) Accord V6/6MT. Note the results:0-60: 6.2s5-60: 6.2sHow many times do you see that? When do you see that? More often than not, you would see 5-60 (rolling acceleration) being higher by 0.5s to 0.8s. And in some cases (as C&D discovered with MazdaSpeed6), 1.6s.The key is that sometimes a car\\'s performance potential is not exploited completely with 0-60 run. Traction plays a huge role, as powerful off the line starts can overpower the drive wheels.Note that in Edmunds\\' test, Accord is 0.1s slower in 0-60, but has higher trap speed at the end of quarter mile. What does it indicate? It seems to be putting down more power to the wheels during that run than the Altima V6. And did so despite of being heavier and rated with lower engine rating (a speculation is that Honda has underrated the engine, it is actually producing 280-285 HP at the crank with the 6-speed manual transmission).  Lots of car makers offer something more than a 4AT in their I4 mid-sized cars. In fact, the 4ATs are becoming the exception. The Malibu LS and LT I4s will continue to have a 4AT for awhile it appears, with only the LTZ I4 getting the 6AT early next year. But Honda, Toyota, Ford/Mercury, Mazda, Kia, Nissan (well, CVT), VW, Subaru (?) all have at least a 5AT with their I4s today. Early next year it looks like Hyundai is making the switch to a 5AT with the Sonata. So those 4ATs will be pretty rare on mid-sizers come 2008.  The V6 in Aura/Malibu has a 6AT and although we expect it to improve fuel economy, it has not been achieved (either reflected in EPA rating or observed ratings from road tests and reported mileage by owners). So, I\\'m wondering if GM\\'s reluctance to keep lower trims with 4AT is driven by the fact that it can still get decent mileage, albeit at reduced performance/refinement.In addition to that, I feel that GM should have put 6AT right from the beginning instead of putting it as a patch just a few months after launch, or waited for the model year to be thru. Mid-year change while announcing it before the car may have even gotten to dealership doesn\\'t sound like a good plan and sends a bad message to those who watch.  I never said that wasn\\'t true. In fact, the 3.5L was supposed to be available when the 500 was launched. We\\'ve already established that Ford was mismanaged back then and made bad decisions. But to imply that they lied on purpose just to sell vehicles is preposterous. In fact, advertising a new engine would most likely have the opposite effect on sales of the current model. And that wasn\\'t a public press release - it was a private dealer letter. And that\\'s precisely why they don\\'t advertise stuff like that publicly.At least now we know why you\\'re so biased against Ford. I would also bet that \"underpowered\" 500 was just as quick as an I4 Accord or Camry though, so I don\\'t see how that could possibly be \"dangerous\" - if it is then we need to recall about 600K vehicles sold last year.  I have a feeling that limiting the 6AT on the Malibu I4 to the LTZ is more of a cost and/or availability issue than lack of FE improvement. It could also be that GM wants to ramp up the 6AT slowly until it\\'s fully proven. The LTZ I4 will sell in low volume compared to the LS and LT I suspect.Why not put the 6AT in all Malibus from the outset? Again, it could be due to limited availability or GM\\'s desire to introduce it slowly. They are not the only automaker to ever offer a significant feature across the board on a mid-sized sedan after a new design has been introduced. Chevy will find out how important it is to mid-sized sedan buyers to have at least 5 forward gears on their ATs when they vote with their pocketbooks in coming months. I\\'m not sure how much Malibu sales will suffer from the lack of a 6AT on the I4s now. From what I\\'m seeing, there may be few Malibus available at dealers this year. My local dealer, which is a pretty big one, has only one 2008 Malibu, an LTZ, now, and they won\\'t get their next Malibu (an I4) for a couple of weeks. That\\'s almost December.  What was also interesting in the Edmunds review was their comments on the Accord\\'s braking system...What\\'s interesting to me is how you pinpointed on the one negative Edmunds had for the Accord Coupe on what was otherwise a very glowing road test.The 6 is an entertaining car to drive. And there\\'s nothing wrong with its V6 power output but it is less powerful then the Accord\\'s. The power difference is noticeable in everyday driving. But so what, your car is more nimble.  \"So that suggests that from a rolling start, the Mazda6 would out-accelerate the Accord\"In your dreams. You can\\'t compare times from 2 different sources.\"Perhaps I\\'m reading too much into this data, but it seems when you say the Mazda6 has a huge power defeceit I\\'d have to say that the difference in acceleration is minor so what\\'s the significance?\"Maybe minor to you, since its the Mz6 that has the deficit. If it was the Accord with the deficit; you would have been all around town.\"Not the car I\\'d like to be driving going around the twisty roads!\"These are street cars; any of these will lose bite after hard cornering. Please don\\'t implpy that your Mz6 would be fade free. Heck, my E90 330i with sport pkd exhibits brake fade after serious runs.\"For many thousands less than the $6000 price difference between the Accord and the Mazda6\"The Mazda6 is not priced cheaper than the Accord. The reason you can buy it for thousands less is because it is a sales failure (including the Mazdaspeed6) right from its launch and Mazda has been giving them away with big discounts. Again, don\\'t imply that Mazda priced the 6 thousands less. Try to get a Mazda 3 for thousands less than a Civic - no you won\\'t because it is a seller and has no 6 type discounts.  \"So you\\'re saying the Accord\\'s 0-60 time in Motortrend will be 5.3 seconds? Yeah, I\\'ll take that bet... \"Cmon, use some common sense. Not 1 second for any and every test. CD once timed a manual V6 Accord (I think it was the 06 or 07 Accord) to 5.9s; I would think the new Accord would be as quick if not more. Wanna wager CD/MT will get a high 5 for the Accord V6 stick?  \"Other then the Escape/Tribute, B-Series/Ranger, which are identical? The Fusion and Mazda6 are similar, but not identical.\"The Mazda3, Ford Focus (Euro) and Volvo s40 were built using one platfrom. The Fusion is a stretched 6 platform. A few of the enignes are shared as well, like the trannys.The similiraties however are not as close as Chevy/Pontiac/GMC  \"I happen to drive a lot of two-lane roads and highways as part of my commute and with weekend jaunts. Not once, and I\\'ll repeat, NOT ONCE has my V6-equipped Mazda6 let me down when I needed more power, both in the instances you just described, and in thousands of other situations when I needed to get up and go. 50 HP may mean something on paper, but where it counts ON THE ROAD, the difference is negligible at best.\"And I happened to drive my now departed 03 Accord over 84k miles, with a vast majority in the hills of Northern NJ; never once did it let me down as far as cornering ability of great handling goes. Some of the posters here would have all of us believe that the Accord is a boat that can\\'t handle, when the actual differences are quite miniscule.  \"I\\'ll take that over a coma-inducing CamCord anytime.\"Coming from a Mazda6 driver? You really think that the camry and accord drive as similarly to each other that you can club them together as coma inducing? If you really want to think coma inducing, think Mazda I-4 or V6  \"Can we just hear about the features and quality of each car without constant jumping in by the fan club for Honda and Accord\"And equally, stop jumping on the hate Honda and Accord bandwagon?  \"I\\'ll second that! Problem is, you still have to follow them once in a while which is almost equally coma-inducing.\"Why not try passing them? Oh I forget, you just can\\'t what with your lame duck engines Enjoy those taillamps.  Some of the posters here would have all of us believe that the Accord is a boat that can\\'t handlePerhaps that is because it has the weakest tires in its class, in an oddball size. Steering feel is on the numb side an the amount of feedback to the driver about what the front wheels are doing is poor. I actually can\\'t get over how much floatier my \\'07 feels than my \\'93.  I put Potenza RE950s on my Accord; never felt better. In fact, the steering of my 03 Accord was telepathic!  Accord has one of the best steering feel there is among midsize sedans. And despite hard OEM tires, the car handles corners extremely well. Don\\'t believe me? Lets meet.   The 93 Accord was a much smaller, lighter, compact car (about the size of the current Civic). It should handle better. The 7th gen I have handles better with Bridgestones. You might want to try some when a sharp rock takes out one of your Michelins.  [non-permissible content removed] for tat... just sharing in the strawman arguments  But really, in the many cars that Edmunds tests, how often have you read that after some of their standard tests the brakes have faded so badly that the abs wouldn\\'t even work.... and how many times have you read Edmunds say \"Yikes\" about a car\\'s brakes? A sporty coupe should have brakes that keep up with it\\'s engine and suspension and it seems clear that the Accord\\'s brakes are not nearly at the same high level as it\\'s engine or suspension.Actually, I\\'m planning on driving the Accord coupe and I think I will like it a lot. Remember the 06 Accord came in 3rd when I was evaluating which car I was going to buy. Also, I\\'ve had 2 Accords in the past and liked them quite a lot. But \"weakish\" brakes on the Accord have been something I\\'ve noticed in several comparos in the past and was something that I was hoping this generation would address. I\\'ve heard this coupe was supposed to have an improved suspension over what was already a pretty competent ride in the previous generation or the softer ride in the current generation\\'s sedan. It\\'s too bad the Altima did not turn out to be the competition it should have been. I thought the Altima had sorted out it\\'s tendency to ride on it\\'s bump stops when hitting a moderately large bump in the road. For a sporty coupe to behave that way is just awful. I\\'d like to believe that Edmonds just got a bad version, but apparently it was bad on many levels. Somebody at Nissan has got some explaining to do...  I\\'d actually agree that the previous generation Accord (I haven\\'t driven the current generation yet so I have no opinion yet) had good steering feel. It was a little bit heavy and numb compared to the mazda6, but still very good and much better than the malibu, impala and Altima (also, both cars were the previous generation) and slightly better than the Sonata. I thought only the 6 and Legacy had better steering than the Accord, but the differences were not great. I\\'m actually surprised lilengineerboy finds that the Accord so disconnected compared to his Subaru, but since he owns both, I\\'d have to think he\\'d know more about it than I.  wow...7 consecutive posts in a row! that\\'s got to be a record...someone\\'s feathers must have been ruffled I have no qualms in admitting the Accord is probably several tenth\\'s faster to 60 than the Mazda6, but for the most part, that difference is not worth the $6,000 more I\\'d have to pay for an Accord v-6 coupe with a manual transmission over a Mazda6 with the same. And I\\'m actually being generous... the Edmunds Accord coupe came to 28k and a Mazda6 v-6 w/ side airbags, ac, cruise, cd changer and 2 extra doors I saw advertised last week for 17k (sticker was 23k). Perhaps, a person could get a discount on the newly released Accord, but I don\\'t think it would be very much at this point. Add to this equation, the Mazda6 would stop in a panic stop 10+ feet sooner from 60mph than the Accord, which over the last 6 months that 10 feet would have put me into the passenger door of a BMW when they made an illegal left hand turn in front of me. I\\'m not saying the Mazda6 is the better car, because in some respects the Accord has some traits that I like more than the Mazda. The seats are some of the best, I like the look of the interior better, it is quieter at speed, it\\'s manual transmission is probably among the best of cars under 35k and yes, the engine has more power. But... the Mazda6 has very good seats, has a nice interior (a bit sportier look vs an Ethan Allen look of the Accord), has a solid manual transmission, has statistically been very reliable, has plenty of power, better brakes, better steering feel, cargo room that is much more flexible, nicer looking exterior (at least in the sedan version imo), is more enjoyable to drive, has 2 extra doors, and costs at least 6k less (not necessarily equipped equally btw). I never would disparage anyone for choosing an Accord though, in fact I\\'ve recently suggested friends should consider it. But for me, the Mazda made sense on many levels, and in two years of ownership, I\\'ve never regretted my choice, which for me is very unusual as I often second guess my choices. In that way, most of us on this forum are lucky that we have found cars that really appeal to us which is why we have such strong opinions about things. I look forward to driving the Accord coupe... not so I can say my Mazda is so much better, and not so I can discover how much better the Accord is than the 6... I look forward to it because I like cars, particularly good cars irregardless of brand.  Lots of car makers offer something more than a 4AT in their I4 mid-sized cars.Right, I am aware of that. GM seems to have been one of the most V6 oriented manufacturers, so having even them finally move beyond 4 speed ATs for the I4 implies greater emphasis on the 4 cyls. Subaru still has only a 4 AT in the legacy and also Chysler in the Sebring (if anyone cares).  Some of the posters here would have all of us believe that the Accord is a boat that can\\'t handle, when the actual differences are quite miniscule.They may be minuscule to you, but not to me, and to the many other auto journalists and drivers that have tested the Accord and the 6 back-to-back. IMO, the 6 felt more composed through corners and switchbacks, with excellent feedback from the steering, and brakes that were almost perfect. The Accord, OTOH, handled well, but I felt more body roll than I did the 6. The steering was good, but with less feedback, which could very well have been due to the less-than-stellar tires. The brakes were good, though, and I\\'m sure they\\'d also be more effective with better tires as well.IMO, between the Accord and the TSX (which I also considered), the TSX was actually the better match with the 6 in terms of handling. If you really want to think coma inducing, think Mazda I-4 or V6With that statement, you\\'ve obviously haven\\'t tried out a 6 with I-4 and manual. Either that, or we\\'re a little too sensitive about our cars...Why not try passing them? Oh I forget, you just can\\'t what with your lame duck engines Enjoy those taillamps.Once again, with my \"lame duck\" engine, I\\'ve NEVER had any problem passing with my 6, including the CamCords.  I never would disparage anyone for choosing an Accord though, in fact I\\'ve recently suggested friends should consider it. But for me, the Mazda made sense on many levels, and in two years of ownership, I\\'ve never regretted my choice, which for me is very unusual as I often second guess my choices.Well stated, and I fully agree. It seems that some others can\\'t say the same though... When I last bought a car in 2004, it was down to the Accord, 6, Altima, and TSX. The Altima was out due to the miserable build quality and interior materials (at the time. For the record, the 2007 Altima that my wife just purchased is quite different and much-improved IMO). The TSX had the excellent Honda VTEC and 6-speed, and the interior was top-notch, but so was the price, and the dealer wouldn\\'t budge anywhere near what I thought was a fair price. The Accord was honestly my second choice, and I probably would\\'ve bought it IF they offered a manual with the 4-door V6 (they didn\\'t at the time). I considered the coupe, but the 4-door is more practical for my needs, and the 6 had the 4-door with V6 and manual, at a lower base price (and much lower OTD price  ).  The 7th gen I have handles better with Bridgestones. You might want to try some when a sharp rock takes out one of your Michelins.Mine has Bridgestone Turanza EL somethings...if this is better I hate to see it before. I can\\'t believe this is the car you are bragging about, I am starting to think there is something wrong with the suspension on mine.On an upside, I noticed my tires are nitrogen filled from the factory/dealer, a nice touch.  PS - what ridiculous statement? I believe I made 2 in that particular post and I also assume that everything I say is ridiculous in any case Now that\\'s funny...and I am glad to hear it from you, as you sometimes seem kinda intense here. Down here in Texas we have things called feeder roads that parallel the highways with many businesses including car dealerships directly accessing that feeder road. Never been in Texas, but have seen the same sort of thing in AL...only no feeder road they just have 50-60 mph highways lined with busnesses and every business has its own entrance and exit directly to the highway. I\\'m no fan of big governement, but too much of that sort of freedom is not good either. We have a little different approach to zoning and highway design in the upper midwest.Anway, the 500 was measured at 8.7 seconds for 0-60 by CR. While this is slow by today\\'s V6 standards and 2 seconds slower than the Maxima and Avalon (6.8 and 6.7 sec, as tested by CR), many (most???) people do not have a problem driving cars with similar or slower acceleration.It has been redesigned since then, but in a test just 2 years before the 500 came out the previous version of the Avalon got a 0-60 of 8.6 seconds, when tested by CR.  On an upside, I noticed my tires are nitrogen filled from the factory/dealer, a nice touch.The Fusion comes from the factory with a 78% Nitrogen blend.   Once again, with my \"lame duck\" engine, I\\'ve NEVER had any problem passing with my 6, including the CamCords. Why I like a turbo under the hood. :shades  They may be minuscule to you, but not to me, and to the many other auto journalists and drivers that have tested the Accord and the 6 back-to-back. IMO, the 6 felt more composed through corners and switchbacks, with excellent feedback from the steering, and brakes that were almost perfect. The Accord, OTOH, handled well, but I felt more body roll than I did the 6. The steering was good, but with less feedback, which could very well have been due to the less-than-stellar tires. The brakes were good, though, and I\\'m sure they\\'d also be more effective with better tires as well.IMO, between the Accord and the TSX (which I also considered), the TSX was actually the better match with the 6 in terms of handling. I think you hit the nail on the proverbial head, I probably should\\'ve looked more at the TSX than the Accord, but the TSX was/is out of budget and incredibly hard to find with a manual transmission. It also seems a little pricey for a 200hp engine, regardless of the number of cylinders. In a way that still doesn\\'t make sense though, at that price point I could\\'ve gotten an MS6.  But to imply that they lied on purpose just to sell vehicles is preposterousnow see we do agree on something, the point was that the dealer was simply relaying what he understood from Ford at that time in an effort to get me in a Five Hundred by asking me to delay a buying decision. Points out the value of internal memos and press releases doesn\\'t it? Asking the 500 to do what an Avalon/Maxima (or any of the other cars I looked at) did without a problem certainly was dangerous, I almost got run over in that particular situation I described. And yes it was my fault for thinking that the DT3.0 was even half the engine that was in the other cars, it isn\\'t. I certainly wouldn\\'t have asked the car to do what I did if I knew it was as handicapped as it was, and I would even go so far as to tell you that the better 4 bangers in this group would have done better than the 500 in that situation, I sorry the car was a slug and Ford ought to have been ashamed. If it makes you feel any better that 3 year too late 3.5 when it finally did arrive would have handled that particular traffic situation with more aplomb even to the point of getting me to consider the car much more seriously at the timeTranslating this whole situation into the midsize segment and getting a little closer to on topic, the Fulans (and 6s to some degree) are in the same neighborhood weight and size wise as that Five Hundred and that DT still sounds (and feels) like a meat grinder at high rpm (and leaves mucho HP on the table) especially compared to what else is available in this class. IMO, its well past time for Ford to put the thing (DT3.0) out of its misery, and possibly go ahead and use that 260hp 3.5 (that everybody else has) in the car - in short make it competitive. Then they might actually be able to have \\'press releases\\' that are at least close to true and not misrepresentations.I guess by your comments we should now believe press releases and ignore what you are calling \\'internal letters\\' when I would think the opposite should be true. If the unthinkable happened and Ford would have to close its doors permanently, I would bet that the Ford dealers would know it in some sort of \\'not for publication \\'internal memo, before it got \\'spun\\' into a press release..  I don\\'t know about the \"floatiness\", but I agree with you on Accord steering...it just seemed way too light to me in my short test drive...but then I read zzzoom6 saying it was heavy compared to the 6 and I think maybe I am nuts. The mazda6, while better than the Accord to me, is still lighter than I would really like, but I have gotten used to it. I actually liked the heavier steering of the Fusion best at the time I was test driving.Just to be sure we are talking about the same thing, by light or heavy I only mean the amount of effort required to turn the steering wheel.  many (most???) people do not have a problem driving cars with similar or slower acceleration. true, my real problem at the time was thinking that the 500 was even in the same class (power wise) as the others, I should have known better. And sure the earlier Avalons were in the same ballpark as that Five Hundred - times change and even rich ole Toyota was late \\'getting on with program\\' with the Avalon and the Camry. Times have changed in the midsize segment as well. 3500 lb. is getting to be an average weight for these things!  And that\\'s the difference between an internal memo and an official press release. You put things in internal memos instead of press releases simply because they might change. You don\\'t want to make a press release and then have to change it later - that\\'s bad PR. And saying that any 200 hp sedan is so underpowered that it\\'s actually dangerous is simply ridiculous - stop being so melodramatic.You don\\'t have to justify your likes and dislikes - just stop trying to turn them into objective facts.  Just to be sure we are talking about the same thing, by light or heavy I only mean the amount of effort required to turn the steering wheel.Yeah, that is where I am at too. Also it seems like if the steering is a little better weighted, it provides more feedback about what the front wheels are doing. On the cloverleaf offramp by my house, the old Accord and the \\'05 Legacy both provide a lot of feedback if I am cooking on that corner, but the newer Accord masks that information.In hindsight - to Elroy\\'s comment, yeah when the \\'93 had MXV4s before the Kumho ASXs, it would squeal quite a bit on corners (but had pretty good snow traction - so maybe there is your trade off).  Yes, that is always a risk when test driving. I once rear-ended an SUV on a test drive, because I expected the brakes (or maybe I should say the tires...as the wheels were locked up) on a protege to work better than they did. Umm...hi mr. salesman, we just had a collision in that car we were test driving...:blush:  Times have changed in the midsize segment as well. 3500 lb. is getting to be an average weight for these things! Yes and this is partly because the mid-size cars are becoming large cars.  The Mazda3, Ford Focus (Euro) and Volvo s40 were built using one platform.A platform does not mean cars are \"identical\", as captain2 said. A platform is a very basic structure on which a vehicle is built. Vehicles may share platforms, but, in actuality, are very very different from there.The Fusion is a stretched 6 platform. A few of the engines are shared as well, like the trannys. I stated that before, the 6 and Fusion are very similar. They do not share tranny\\'s. Mazda had their own, and are not shared with any other company.The similarities however are not as close as Chevy/Pontiac/GMC Those company\\'s build mechanically identical vehicles. Only differences are cosmetic and the way they package or offer options.   I once rear-ended an SUV on a test drivenow I can\\'t say that I ever did that but I cam (almost) understand I would bet that most of us have a tendency to \\'wring out\\' cars we test drive. I sure do.   Yes I would also tend to \\'wring out\\' cars on a test drive. I\\'ll floor it to test acceleration and noise and take corners fast in an area with no traffic, etc. I imagine the dealer figured I was following to close and driving like a maniac.But when I had the crash I was driving sedately at 30-40 mph on a busy street and the car just took forever to stop...skidded a long, long way. I\\'m no tailgater either, I allow way more space than most drivers do...in this case I needed an extra 2-3 feet.Maybe brand new tires don\\'t have their full traction yet or something...the car had like 11 miles on it after we smashed it.  Certainly can\\'t blame you for testing the full limits of a car on a test drive. But, you fella\\'s are the exact reason I refuse to buy a new car that has even been test driven. Kudos to dealerships that have special cars dedicated to test driving. That\\'s the best of both worlds . . you get to really test the car, then hop into your new car that has never been abused!  Why not try passing them?Uh, because it\\'s illegal on a two lane road with double yellow lines! And it\\'s also very dangerous when the roads are very hilly and winding. Kind of makes it hard to see if someone is coming the other way. Nice try though.Oh I forget, you just can\\'t what with your lame duck engines Enjoy those taillamps.Sorry. Don\\'t drive the 6 anymore. Want me to try and pass you with my Mustang GT? Don\\'t worry, you\\'ll only see the taillamps for a second or two then they\\'ll just be little red dots on the horizon. Tends to make the feeling of embarassment easier to deal with when it doesn\\'t last long to begin with. Oh, and I\\'ll even perform that pass with my wife, two boys, and some groceries in the car too. :P  \"Uh, because it\\'s illegal on a two lane road with double yellow lines!

Hey, as they say: \"If you can\\'t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.\"And yeah, I may have bundled the CamCord as coma-inducing, but then again, it\\'s MY OPINION. The Camry (SE not included) surely fits that description. And while I have yet to try out a \\'08 Accord, I doubt that the larger (and heavier) car can improve on the \\'03-\\'07, let alone the excellent handling (IMO) the late \\'90\\'s had before that.So maybe \"coma-inducing\" is a little harsh, but I haven\\'t taken any shots to the 6 personally...  I guess each car gets pegged with a stereo-type. But, some of those stereo-types seem to be born out by the consumer reviews for the Camry and Accord. Take a look -- new Camry owners seem to focus on interior amenities, size and comfort. Of course, so do Accord owners. But, Accord owners also seem to note such things as steering response, engine power, ride and handling quality. Interesting . . . .  Even if you did try; you wouldn\\'t be able to. I didn\\'t realize you had some special one-off turbo-charged JATO powered version, because if you are talking about the EX 5spd manual I have been driving for the last few months, I think you are having a memory issue after driving your BMW too much.As fun as this bench racing \"mine is bigger than yours\" conversation is, its really not supported either way. In fact, it puts me to sleep almost as fast as the Accord.  Weight adds up quickly for a lot of reasons. It has little to do with physical size of the vehicle itself (which goes by EPA definition). Even a Rabbit can tip the scale around 3200 lb. Saturn Aura goes to 3630 lb and it will be safe to assume it will weight even more if there were additional options to be added.Compared a base Accord with MT (LX) with fully featured four cylinder version with AT (EX-L/NAV) might make for a good example. The curb weights:Accord LX (MT): 3230 lbAccord EX-L (AT): 3433 lbThat is a whopping 203 lb difference. Just by looking at the spec sheet, I can account for almost 75% of it.Larger Wheels: 60-70 lbAT versus MT: 60-70 lbMoon roof/NAV: 30-35 lbBesides these, and while safety features are standard and there is no difference, there is in terms of NVH handling (noise insulation, potentially more advanced engine mount), tweaks to chassis for additional rigidity etc.One might think that going from 16&#148; wheels on LX to 17&#148; wheels should not make for a big difference. But it does. In fact, Accord&#146;s new 17&#148; rim is wider (17x7.5) to accommodate P225/50/R17 tire than the 17&#148; rim used in last year&#146;s Accord (17x7) that accommodated P215/50/R17 tire. Equipped with OEM tires, each of the new size weighs 7-8 lb more, and that adds up to 30 lb for that small increase. It might be at least twice that compared to the smaller rim (16x6.5) in LX trim.Cars today are also far safer than before. And safety goes beyond just hitting a wall. Complex ways are being devised to accommodate everything from offering greater safety to pedestrians to being able to make colliding vehicle more compatible.  Translating this whole situation into the midsize segment and getting a little closer to on topic, the Fulans (and 6s to some degree) are in the same neighborhood weight and size wise as that Five HundredThe difference in weight between a Ford 500 (when it was still named that and had the 3.0 see this link for the weight: link title) and an automatic Mazda6 w/ leather and moonfoof is 340 pounds, which to me is not in the same neighborhood. And to me, the engine in the Mazda6 sounds very smooth with a touch of a growl to it (although not as smooth as the Accord or Altima v-6\\'s). Perhaps what you were hearing was different tuning in the 500 or maybe the engine laboring to carry much more weight? Mazda did tweak the engine a bit too, so perhaps that\\'s why your descriptions don\\'t really match what I\\'ve experienced. I mean, someone could say that after driving a Honda Pilot they should diss the TL just because their engine and chassis are similar, but I think that criticism would be misplaced because the weights are so different.  May be getting a little touchy here but I don\\'t ever recall saying or even implying that cars that shared similar platforms were necesarily identical. In fact I said something about a few more inches (stretching) and some different suspension (tighter) pieces talking about the differences betwen the Fulan and 6, Another good example of this might be the M35 and Altima/Maxima which are all FM platofrm cars that even use the same base engine, but the M35 specifically is quite a different car isn\\'t it?As long as you seem to be getting on GM for simply relabeling what exactly do you think Ford is doing with the Milan or Chrysler is doing with the Charger. Etc. Etc. IMPO I think the Milan is a far better looking ride than the Fusion, simply replacing some taillights and junking the \\'razor blades\\'. Not to mention the interior which struck me as an upgrade (as in typical for the Mercury nameplate) Again IMPO I think the car to own from FoMoCo in this size class has to be the Lincoln MK if for no other reason than the engine - if only it wasn\\'t so overpriced.  \"Hey, as they say: \"If you can\\'t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.\" And yeah, I may have bundled the CamCord as coma-inducing, but then again, it\\'s MY OPINION.

If it can hold its current weight and increase power with the 3.7, it should be a fast car.

If you\\'ve seen the interior of a CX-9 you\\'ll have an idea of where the new 6 is. It\\'s still sporty but adds a bit more warmth. Not that I dislike the fit and finish of the current 6, but I like the improvements in the new one too. here\\'s a link to the interior of the new 6: 2009 mazda6 interior  Yep. And that pretty tells all about the expertise in handling around here.   Seriously, my point was that the Accord is not as good a handler as a 6, but its no slouch either. I totally agree. This all started when you challenged a 6 to pass an Accord on a back road. I was actually referring to the last gen Accord as it is still the most found on the road. Given the handling advantage of the 6 and it\\'s comparable acceleration numbers, weaker engine and all, it\\'s a pretty good match wiht that gen Accord. Obviously there was some mis-communication so your point is valid when discussing the current Accord. And no, neither the Accord nor the Camry sixes are faster than a 330i, straight line or switchbacks.According to MT a 2007 330i does 0-60 in 6.6 seconds. Both the new Accord and Camry should be faster than that. Have you read differently? Just curious. :shades: As for handling, brakes etc., I would think I would be faster than you, what with your 400lb penalty (wife, kids, groceries) Maybe in the handling dept., yes! I don\\'t think 400lbs would make up for the 1.5 second difference to 60 between the two though.  I didn\\'t buy it for it\\'s handling anyway. The 6 was more fun in the twisites as I\\'ve stated once before even though it actually doesn\\'t handle as well as the Mustang. It was just easier to drive and more tossable. It seemed to have the right mix of power and handling for a spirited drive whereas the Mustang has too much power for the twisties, at least around here, and can be a handful if you\\'re not careful.  I\\'ve driven several Mustangs very hard, although they were not the current generation.The last part of that sentence is the problem. The new one is night and day. Ford Racing tuned Mustangs are constantly beating BMWs on professional circuits these days. Solid rear axle and all.Besides, I was going by magazine test numbers which do show the two as even mostly. I\\'m not a professional driver and a BMW is probably much easier to drive and that makes a big difference.  When considering a midsize sedan, I (like most people) don\\'t put handling as the #1 attribute I am looking for. I don\\'t want a car that has sloppy handling, but being able to pull maximum g-forces around every corner is not what I\\'m buying the car for. For the Mazda 6 crowd, this may be the top priority. For most of us, it\\'s not that important.  And the Mustang really does not belong here, so let\\'s drop it from the conversation.Then neither does the Accord or Altima coupe. :P  Thanks for the link that shows the interior of the next 6. I don\\'t like it. I\\'m not crazy about the Accord\\'s either. Honda will probably screw up the interior of the next TSX too. Well, according to my tastes anyway. I do like the interior of the next A4 though.  Yeah, it\\'s not jaw dropping at all, but I do think it\\'s better than the current version. But really, it\\'s not a huge departure from the current gen like the new Sonata vs the old Sonata. That\\'s one interior that took a huge leap forward IMO. I\\'ve resized a different pic so it\\'s easier to view:  Based on the photo, I like the current interior better. This one looks so... plasticky. Maybe because the photo is so dark.  I agree with backy. Too plasticky and the old 6 looks more upscale.  What\\'s with the giant grab handle on the door? Is that door made of lead? Does it take two hands to pull it shut?  I like it. But that\\'s because it bears a striking resemblence to the Mazda3 that I\\'ve been driving for the last two years.  I think that\\'s the \"O crap! You\\'re not going to take that corner at this speed are you?!?!\" handle. fyi, the driver\\'s side door doesn\\'t have that handle...    Yeah, those pics are a little more flattering than that first one. That big thing in the middle that has the numbers 1-6 on it makes my heart go a flutter as well.  I\\'d have to see the interior of the cheaper versions to come to a final judgement, since that would be what I would buy, were I buying. But I am pretty sure I\\'ll prefer the current interior. I think the current version looks \"sportier\" overallI don\\'t like the steering wheel with the silver bits and excessively chunky spokes. The button in the middle of the audio controls looks like it says \"menu\"...not something I want, menu implies an overly complex system to me. The woodgrain bit on the center console makes me want to puke...what\\'s Mazda going to do next put in a partial wood steering wheel  ? I much prefer the look and functionality of the round vents to those rectagular ones.What does \"ACC\" on the start button mean? (just curious)  When considering a midsize sedan, I (like most people) don\\'t put handling as the #1 attribute I am looking for. I don\\'t want a car that has sloppy handling, but being able to pull maximum g-forces around every corner is not what I\\'m buying the car for. For most of us, it\\'s not that important.Well said. And that is why there is some variety in the marketplace. Our Legacy has been phenomenal, it is a wagon (I know, not a sedan, but it does have a sedan counterpart), has AWD, a manual transmission, about 30 mpg, and is powerful enough to get out of its own way (although not a lot to write home about). I feel that it handles really well, even on crummy RE92s. Turn in is crisp, the back end feels very stable, there is a lot of feedback on what the car is doing. In poor weather, it is very stable (unless you are messing around) and provides a lot of feedback on road conditions.Our Accord has returned stellar fuel efficiency (low to mid 30s), feels very powerful for a 4 cylinder (rated about the same HP as the Subie), and does a great job holding the child seat. It has very sluggish turn-in, masks what the front wheels are doing, has a lot of body roll for a car in 2007, and doesn\\'t really do anything to inspire driver confidence. Normally some of that could be corrected with a tire upgrade, but due to a minivan tire size, performance options are severely limited w/o going to a 17\" wheel. On an upside, KBB, NADA, and Edmunds all have \"trade-in value\" pegged at about what I paid for it.  What does \"ACC\" on the start button mean? (just curious)On another vehicle that has that push start, you push it once to get the ACC position, or push and hold to start the car. The ACC position is the equivalent of turning the key to the accessory setting.  The pics are from the European version, so I\\'m sure some of the trim details will be different here in the states, but I\\'ll agree that I hope the woodgrain is a separate option (if offered at all).The square vents in the center stack makes me want to believe that the oscillating option for the vents returns once again (originally used on the 626). That was a surprisingly useful function. With the advent of dual climate control, I doubt it\\'ll be so, but still, one can hope...   In other words, ACC stands for Accessory.  \"According to MT a 2007 330i does 0-60 in 6.6 seconds. Both the new Accord and Camry should be faster than that. Have you read differently? Just curious.\" BMW\\'s conservative estimates for the 330i were 6.1s to 60. CD I remember did a high 5 on one of theirs.\"Maybe in the handling dept., yes! I don\\'t think 400lbs would make up for the 1.5 second difference to 60 between the two though\"I would think that difference would be more like < 1sec. And we were discussing switchbacks - so yeah, a 330i would have an advantage Before I get kicked out for being OT - let\\'s get back to midsize cars..  That does look better than the first photo. At least they lost those huge upright handles. Those looked really strange--and cheap. But since this is probably the top-end interior (e.g. note the nav), there\\'s still a little too much black plastic there for my taste. The dark plood is nice looking. I agree the spokes on the wheel are too big, If those bright door pulls are honest-to-gosh metal, that would be great.I don\\'t see a button to control the ocillating vents, so I doubt that feature has returned. I\\'d be real surprised if it had, in this era of de-contenting to save every last buck.  Do you have problems comprehending english? Where did I say the Accord handles better than a 6? Can you point it out on any of my posts? No I don\\'t have a problem \"comprehending english\". I was commenting on what he said, not you. I did not read your posts. I read his, in which he said his opinion was the 6 handled better. If you didn\\'t say it does, that\\'s fine. I was just saying that it\\'s not a matter of his opinion, it is fact. Since I didn\\'t read your posts, I didn\\'t know you didn\\'t say that. So, about my \"whether he likes it or not\" comment, I apologize. No need to insult, we are all adults here...most of us anyways....  To be honest, I really like the layout of the interior. I find that it fits with what Mazda is trying to do with \"connecting\" the car the driver with a \"cockpit\" type layout. That goes very well with the \"zoom-zoom\" philosophy. As for the quality of materials, it is near impossible to tell until we see them in person. From what I see, they seem right on par with everything else in this class. What seems to be clear is that the dash is in fact NOT plastic for the most part, and is actually the \"squishy\" foam type dash, like the current 6 has. If you look at the area around the \"push start\" button and gauge bezel, you can see that it is not plastic.As of right now, all we can go on is what we see in photos and Mazda\\'s own comments on their dedication to using higher quality interior materials.  I think it\\'s amazing that you can tell whether plastic is soft touch or not from a photo.  And plastic is plastic, whether it\\'s foam-backed or not.I said that the first photo (the real dark one) looked \"plasticky.\" The second set of photos look a lot better to me. Part of the problem I have with the new interior is that I\\'m not a fan of black interiors in general, especially interiors that are acres of black plastic. There\\'s some interesting contrasting materials in this cabin, e.g. the dark plood and metallic trim, but a lot of black. Hard to tell from the photo how soft the leather seats will be, what the door panels and dash will look like and feel like, etc. Some interiors look much better in person than in photos.  I\\'m a fan of black interiors. Black is the best color.  Never thought I would buy an all-black interior .. but I just did in my 08 Accord. Honda did kind of a cool thing. The black dashboard is hard plastic -- but it is very textured -- just like an interior wall in a house. It has a very matt-finished, subtle bubble-like texture that really makes it not look hard, shiny and plastic. On the stereo and climate control surround, Honda used a matt-finish black that actually has very very subtle sparkles. That sounds bad, but it isn\\'t. It really gives the interior a much better appearance. I doubt it will ever be noticeable in a picture -- you\\'ll have to go look at one. Other than the awful brushed aluminum accents in my Accord (which look 100% like plastic), I really like the interior look of my all-black, leather interior   Sometimes you can&#146;t tell by looking at a picture (or even in person) if the material is soft touch (padded vinyl or some kind of hard rubber) or hard plastic. Here is an example from my 1998 Accord:And this is from 2002 Jetta:Hard plastic (or rubber in some newer cars) will generally provide for crisper edges. Other than that, it is virtually impossible in many cases to tell the difference from hard surface to one that is padded. In case of the Accord, top is hard plastic, something I couldn&#146;t tell without pressing against it. The lighter shade is padded. In the VW, the reverse is true. In my 2000 Civic, everything was padded but it didn&#146;t have as crisp edges as the Accord.That said, I haven&#146;t understood the need for soft padding on the top of the dash. To me, it needs to be soft where it matters, as long as the hard plastic rubber doesn&#146;t look rough and brittle, and here is a classic case of cheap plastic-cityI do want padding on the arm rest however. Looking at this picture, that would be one of my concerns with something like the new Malibu.Besides cost control, recycling is becoming a bigger part of car design, so that also has some impact on choices.As far as some of the pictures of the 6 goes, I\\'m wary of those tiny buttons. With the NAV, they almost look Camry-eque, as well as six small buttons on the steering. One of the ideas for putting buttons on the steering has to be elimination of taking eyes off the road. With pieces that small, that doesn\\'t seem to be a consideration. Even buttons on the dash are scattered and look a bit disorganized. Even a quick glance might not work well. There is more of form over function going there.  Black interior with a nice touch of aluminum and faux carbon fiber trim is one of the major reasons I chose silver exterior on the TL, which came with black leather. I love it, and the design is just for me... very industrial and appeals to this engineer.Although I haven\\'t seen the new Accord\\'s interior up close yet, but from pictures the matte plastic around stereo appears to be similar to TL. It looks very good, although difficult to maintain the clean look. But then, I rarely use those buttons. Although used a little, instead of covering up a whole area, I do detest the pieces the Accord has with silvery plastic. I haven\\'t seen a single rental car with an expanse of similar plastic that hasn\\'t had a permanent scratch. A little touch shouldn\\'t hurt much, but I would rather not have it at all as those textures don\\'t age well. But it is a norm in virtually every vehicle these days, some just rely on it to create the impression of an appealing interior.  Yeah, you gotta have some padding on the elbows. It mystifies me how some carmakers don\\'t realize that. Nissan seems to get it--they have cushy padding on the armrests even on their low-bucks Versa (all but the strippo base version anyway).Padded dashes aren\\'t important in the grand scheme of things, if the hard plastic is well done. Maybe it\\'s just that in many cases, the padded dashes look a little more upscale than hard plastic.As for buttons being scattered, I think it depends on if the buttons are logically grouped. For example, if all the switches for HVAC are clustered in one place, and the controls for the audio system are in another place, I don\\'t think it matters that they\\'re in two different areas, as long as they are a convenient reach and don\\'t block other things like shifters, cupholders etc.  One of the ideas for putting buttons on the steering has to be elimination of taking eyes off the road. With pieces that small, that doesn\\'t seem to be a consideration.After a day or two, you quickly get accustomed to each button on the wheel via it\\'s location and feel. It\\'s similar to working the buttons on a video game console. Some of those buttons get pretty small, but after a while you don\\'t even need to look (with the added benefit of not taking your hands off the wheel.) Even buttons on the dash are scattered and look a bit disorganized. Even a quick glance might not work well. There is more of form over function going there.IMO it\\'s no worse than the new Accord or Camry. The Altima, OTOH (w/o nav) is quite possibly the most straight-forward layout and function of any car in any class.  From looking at the pictures, the dash has the same textured look as the current Mazda6. That leads me to believe that is has the soft touch material. Could I be wrong? Yes, but, the fact that is looks identical to the current 6 dash material, I would think it\\'s the same.  Me too...I love interiors that are acres of black plastic. I do like a lighter shade (Gray) for the headliner though.  The Mazda 6/NAV bears some similarities to Camry&#146;s dash. Both have thin horizontal buttons on both sides of the screen.The problem with those is not only they are small, they are also not as easy to figure out with a quick glance. OTOH, I have seen plenty of comments around how buttons in Accord have intimated folks. The fact is that they are logically grouped, are large and are much more clearly marked than in virtually any other car. As a matter of fact, while I thought 2003-2007 Accord&#146;s dash looked good and a departure from most cars of its time, it lacked cohesiveness and some of it made thru in the 2004 TL too which happens to be the only dislike. While they are still logically grouped, the buttons are small in the TL and require more than a glance. This is not the case with the 2008 Accord.The buttons are large and logically grouped. A glance reveals the functions, if one chooses to use them. An idea that has been gaining momentum in an effort to reduce buttons is to go thru \"menu\" button and scroll thru selections, and I am against it. My first love is voice activated controls, second is ergonomically correct controls (but not too many of them) on the steering, and finally, clearly marked practically size buttons with as much dedicated function as possible.Also note the buttons on the steering wheel in the 6. Those are tiny. It seems that the way to use them would be to use the tip of the thumb, or else it would be the case of trial and error.When it comes to video games, I prefer games around cars, and have to have steering wheels.  Personally I think you are nit-picking on the buttons. Those on the nav on the Camry and 6 are relatively narrow, but long and there\\'s a lot of space between them. The buttons on the Accord may be larger in surface area, but there\\'s no space between them. Which are easier to punch? If you look at the buttons on the Accord right below the HVAC controls (all 11 of them), they look similar in size and shape to those on the nav consoles on the Camry and 6. But there\\'s no spacing between them. Are those buttons on the Accord easier to use because they are lined up horizontally, with no spacing, vs. the vertical alignment on the Camry and 6? If that is what you believe, I don\\'t see the benefit to the Accord\\'s arrangement.Also realize you are comparing two cars with nav to a car w/o nav. The control layouts would tend to be different in a car with nav and one without. One thing to keep in mind is that most factory nav systems in this class of car are voice activated. So that raises the question of how often the driver would actually use the buttons on the nav console.There really is a striking similarity between the center console control and vent layouts on the Camry and 6 though, especially if you compare the Camry with manual HVAC to the 6.  Accord would have an unfair advantage over others if I threw in the NAV equipped version. It has voice control for virtually everything which renders buttons on the dash largely redundant. Here it is, if you insist and want to use the buttons instead:The beauty of the layout is that not only they are organized well, they are ergonomically correct. And you haven\\'t really seen me nitpick. There is something in the dash that I would have done a bit differently to make things even more consistent. Here is one from Camry (this is for hybrid, but I assume the NAV version is similar):Its not about just about ease of punching, it is also about the ease to figure out the button to punch. The only way this can be proven is that I show what I mean, in person.Here is a DIY. Both pictures provide fairly good closeups. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the layout. Now, with a function in mind, give a quick glance to each and see for yourself which of the two works better, or that you see no difference.In fact, just look at the location of Skip/Seek and Scan buttons. Does THAT make a difference? Does it matter they be placed anywhere on the dash, as long as they exist? Or does it matter that they are grouped together in some way?  With the steering wheel controls on my Mazda6, the only time I look over at the other buttons is to change the temp on the HVAC system... The new 6 is supposed to have the HVAC controls on the steering wheel so really there would be no need to take my eyes off the road. It\\'s kind of like my remote control at home for TV...I never have to read the buttons now and compared to the controls in the cars that we\\'ve been talking about, my remote is waayyy more complicated. One thing that I do like about the Camry pic above is that the buttons, though smaller, are closer together so I my eyes have to move less to read more which lets me find the button I need faster. Just a personal preference of course...and one that after a couple weeks wouldn\\'t matter anyway since I\\'d know where the controls were by then. One thing that I would really like in a car in this class that would really help me keep my eyes on the road is a heads up display. Of course I\\'d like it to display more than just speed, rpm and a fuel gauge, but also song titles and HVAC settings. Even better would be if the info could be customizable like my desktop on my computer.  I\\'m having trouble reading the top few posts because the ad to the right of the posts is making words unreadable. Anyone else having this prob?  ...and one that after a couple weeks wouldn\\'t matter anyway since I\\'d know where the controls were by then. Yes, that\\'s pretty much the case with all but the worst control layouts. It\\'s a big deal if you almost never drive the car, as in a road test or rental, but not if you drive it every day. And with wheel and voice controls becoming more common, how often are the controls on the console used?  I\\'m having trouble reading the top few posts because the ad to the right of the posts is making words unreadable. Anyone else having this prob? Not sure, but it may have something to do with your screen resolution, or maybe your font size is way too large. I have that problem on some websites (ESPN.com). I\\'m definitely not a computer wiz. I\\'m lucky I know how to type at my age.   Yes, I see it too. I\\'m asking about it.  I\\'m a fan of black interiors. Black is the best color.Back in the early 90s I had a car with a black leather interior. I\\'ll probably never forget what that felt like when I first sat down in the seat after it had been sitting in a parking lot on a hot summer day. Never again.  This is no doubt the most fabulous and refined black interior ever designed for an automotive use:  It won\\'t let me reply to post 7337, but I have to respectfully say I disagree whole-heartedly.  Yes, that\\'s pretty much the case with all but the worst control layouts. It\\'s a big deal if you almost never drive the car, as in a road test or rental, but not if you drive it every day. This is exactly the reason why I don\\'t pay too much attention to testers that complain about control layout and/or functions. After a few days (and reading the manual, which should be required by law), the controls come as second-nature. As long as I don\\'t have to scroll through 15 different menus just to raise the HVAC temperature (such as some integrated Nav systems and BMW\\'s miserable I-Drive), I\\'m good to go.The only time controls become more of an issue is when you rent a car, and even then, a couple minutes pushing a few buttons and turning a few knobs will get one accustomed enough to be on their way.Besides, it\\'s a good way to keep your annoying friends from changing the radio station or HVAC controls from the passenger seat, when the driver SHOULD be in complete control!   Yes, I can understand the problem with black, if you have leather. Luckily, I love black but hate leather :shades: .  Right. In 30 years of renting cars, I\\'ve had problems with controls on only one--a Crossfire. After a few days, I never did find a few controls for basic functions. And I kept turning on the cruise control when I just wanted to change lanes. It was an ergnomic disaster. By comparison, mid-sized family cars seem to have reasonable control layouts. Some have dials, some have lots of buttons, some groop all the bottons together in one place and some spread them around more, but after a few days it\\'s easy to find the right controls.  I\\'m having trouble reading the top few posts because the ad to the right of the posts is making words unreadable. Anyone else having this prob?Glad you said something. I thought maybe it was just my ancient computer acting up. I get the same display that you do.  Man, for all my whining about the 205/60R16 crummy tire size on the Accord, the Fusion/base Mazda6 has the same size. There is nothing inherently wrong with the size, just the lack of real performance tires in that size. I guess everyone that wants the vehicle to handle well opts for the 17\" or 18\" wheel pkgs, which gets to RobertMX\\'s issue of adding 40-50 lbs of unsprung weight to the equation.I guess the answer is to chose ligthweight aftermarket wheels w/summer tires (ala MazdaSpeed6, Civic SI) and use the stock wheels for snow tires or something.Honestly, 205/55R16 tires are available in every style from mild to wild from every manufacturer under the sun. You would think they could just go with something like that vs reinventing the wheel, eh or tire I guess.  It\\'s in fact quite ugly.  such as some integrated Nav systems and BMW\\'s miserable I-DriveThere is nothing wrong with i-drive. I figured it out in 30 seconds while travelling at 50 mph.  Copuldn\\'t you just put the 55s on and have your speedometer be off by 2-3 mph at freeway speeds?For 2008 I believe Mazda has made the 17 in alloys standard on base (sport) model.What I don\\'t understand is why a 17 inch tire apparently costs so much more than the exact same model of tire in 16 inch size. I assume it is because of the greater volume of 16 inch sales???With 17s becoming pretty common, I wonder if this will change by the time I need replacement tires. I won\\'t really be looking for any kind of super-performance tires and I sure won\\'t buy the Mazda6 OEM model that runs $200 even on tirerack.  Man, for all my whining about the 205/60R16 crummy tire size on the Accord, the Fusion/base Mazda6 has the same size. The SEL AWD 2007 Fusion has a 17-inch by 7.5-inch alloy wheel outfitted with 225-50-17 Michelin Pilots. I only have 5,300 miles on these and I am already dreading the day when I have to replace them. Current prices are $200 to $230 per tire not including balancing and new stem valves.Has anybody had any experiences with Pep Boys tires or tires ordered through Sam\\'s Club? I am more interested in a comfortable ride and tread longevity than I am performance. $1,000 for four new tires is way out of my league.  P205/55/R16 is now Civic-sized (BMW 328i also uses it). Accord LX/LX-P have P215/55/R16, while EX/EX-L/EXV6/EX-LV6 sedan trims and four cylinder coupe trims have P225/50/R17. V6 coupes get P235/45/R18.I\\'m guessing, with HFP package when it arrives, will have 19\" rims. :P  Has anybody had any experiences with Pep Boys tires or tires ordered through Sam\\'s Club?Avoid Pep Boys at all costs! Their tires are cheap, but you get what you pay for unfortunately. Plus, they\\'ve been known to sell and install tires that have too low a load or speed rating for the specific vehicle, creating a potentially dangerous situation, just to make a few $$$$.Check out Tirerack.com. There are plenty of tires in that size that are much less expensive than OEMs.  My family has been pleased with service through Wal-Mart. My dad just bought tires for his 2007 Civic through his local Wal-Mart, and had them installed there.I get my oil changed at my Wal-Mart as well in my Accord.  I get my oil changed at my Wal-Mart as well in my Accord.Good luck with that. My buddy got a brand new engine after they put the wrong oil filter on his Camry. I wouldn\\'t let Wal-Mart wash my dog.As for tires - you can change tire sizes up to a point - just try to keep the overall diameter close.  Costco and Sam\\'s are fine if you have one close to you. But the regular tire retailers offer more services and in a lot of cases have prices very close to tirerack, Sam\\'s and Costco.  They don\\'t touch my 2006 (I get that at the dealer). They service my 1996, with 176k miles. I\\'d love a new engine!   The caddy STS has a nice interior.  I would be reluctant to change tire sizes --- the suspension is tuned for the wheel and tire that come on your car. Other sizes, particularly if they have a heavier spring weight - mess with the suspension. [This is a major problem for vehicles that have adjustable suspensions or electronically controlled suspensions.]  There is nothing wrong with i-drive. I figured it out in 30 seconds while travelling at 50 mph. I guess you may be an exception. The majority of owners and writers seem to think otherwise.  I won\\'t really be looking for any kind of super-performance tires and I sure won\\'t buy the Mazda6 OEM model that runs $200 even on tirerack. Tell me about it. It\\'s time for me to replace mine, and I\\'m having a hard time finding tires I would be comfortable with. I am not spending $200/tire on the OEM Michelins, size P215/50 R17 93V. I am contemplating the Bridgestone Potenza G 009\\'s.  Sometimes house brand tires are made by a major manufacturer but \"private labeled.\" I have yet to be impressed with anything at all that ever came from Wal-Mart, and their prices for name brand products don\\'t seem to be all that great.You are not obligated to get Michelin again, you might look at other tires in the same size on tirerack or discount tire to get an idea what they should cost. You may want to look at the treadware rating on the tire, as a higher number implies a longer life. That said, that usually results in a harder rubber compound which is typically less compliant and also typically increases braking distances. You get what you pay for.PS. on tirerack, your tires are $166-175 for the Michelins, and there are better options out there for less $$  I would be reluctant to change tire sizes --- the suspension is tuned for the wheel and tire that come on your car. Other sizes, particularly if they have a heavier spring weight - mess with the suspension. [This is a major problem for vehicles that have adjustable suspensions or electronically controlled suspensions.]I disagree. The suspension design is a series of trade-offs between ride quality, nvh, and vehicle handling. Tire selection is mostly a matter of the purchasing group fighting with the marketing group. The priorities of the designers or marketing people may be different for your own (urnews wants things a little cushier, I would like things a little firmer, etc). An educated consumer can better align the vehicle to the driving characteristics they desire than it was delivered from the factory.  To some extent, bug4 is correct. Accord comes with three different rim sizes depending on trim, and their diameter...P215/55/R16: 25.31\" (LX/LX-P)P225/50/R17: 25.86\" (LX-S, EX/EX-L, EXV6/EX-LV6 sedan)P235/45/R18: 26.32\" (EXV6/EX-LV6 coupe)Each of the chassis is tuned differently, and likely matched to the tire as well. But more important thing to remember is that each of those rims have different width. IIRC...16x6.517x7.518x8.0The width determines how far you can go safely with the width of rubber. In 2007, Honda P215/50/R17 tires were mounted on 17x7 rims. For P225/50/R17 tires, the new choice is 17x7.5.It happened with me once. I had tires replaced at Discount Tire Company, and they put a wider tire on one of the wheels which went into smokes about 30-40 mile later as I had embarked on my road trip soon after. I had to return, got it replaced, restarted my journey but before I went far, decided to check air pressure. In the process, noted there was another tire with the wrong size. Had to return again.So, it is important to consider more things.  \"I guess you may be an exception. The majority of owners and writers seem to think otherwise\"I disagree with this statement. Now if you want to say the majority of writers can\\'t figure it out, I\\'ll agree with you.  I guess we can agree to disagree. My uncle has a 745i and hates the iDrive, my chiropractor has a 525xi and he said he would prefer it didn\\'t have it. I have also seen numerous complaints, most stemming from when the iDrive debuted, in a few BMW forums. That is why I said what I said.  What is wrong with i-Drive? :shades:  Putting a blatantly wrong size is different then using a +0,+1 or +2 fitments to achieve the desired performance result. You had a clearance issue when someone installed a tire (I\\'m guessing with the wrong aspect ratio) so the tire was hitting the upright or wishbone.As far as the tire size and circumference, I almost doubt there is a correction for the first 2 (LXs and EXs) in the speedometer, and in the 3rd case I bet it is handled in software.When you purchase tires, the tire will be spec\\'d for a rim width range. Even tires that are the same width occasionally have different upper and lower limits for rim width. It requires being knowledgeable and a little bit of checking. Does every Joe Average consumer need to worry about it? No. Can you make a better decision or purchase choice armed with a little information? Definitely.  It was too wide for the rims, and came apart at high speed. I was traveling 70-75 mph when I felt a bit of wobble and droning noise, and pulled over to the shoulder. The right rear tire was smoking hot (literally). Apparently, it had lost air pressure a while ago.So, its not just being too tall or too wide from the sprung chassis, but also the rim size. One needs to be wary of those when changing tire size.  I\\'m sure your right about the fight between purchasing and designers on tires / wheels. But, once that decision is made, I\\'m confident the chassis and suspension is tuned accordingly. Just as a transmission largely defines the actual performance of the engine, the suspension largely defines the performance of the tire. I dont\\' think you can effectively slap a 18\" tire on a suspension set up for a lighter 17\" tire. The extra tread on the 18\" isn\\'t going to as much good if the lighter-tuned suspension can\\'t hold it on the ground   I\\'m sure your right about the fight between purchasing and designers on tires / wheels.

If there was the clearance and offset, going to a wider tire in the same diameter would be an option as well.Its not even so much about changing the size, its about the tire itself. The PepBoys house brand tire isn\\'t going to handle like a Pirelli P-Zero. That same P-Zero will have different characteristics than the Yokahama AVID H4. Tires are the single biggest factor on the vehicle when it comes to handling and ride. There are gains to be had when replacing the stock configuration.  I guess we can agree to disagree.

Now I don\\'t read the manual to see what the 100s of settings for for, but in 1 minute I set up the car for me. The new incarnation of the idrive is far and away better than the old, but I\\'d rather have idrive than 100s of buttons.  That...... takes the cake, IMO.  What is that?  Voice activation for over 700 commands, I believe.  I drove the 750il and adjusted specific idrive settings while driving.

The new incarnation of the idrive is far and away better than the old, but I\\'d rather have idrive than 100s of buttons.There are a few issues here. 1. The increasing complexity of vehicles leads to 1000 tiny buttons or having a control structure like i-Drive or Audi\\'s MMI. 2. The original incarnation of i-Drive was not a user centered design, and I doubt they did use cases to determine the feature set. I think they made a big list of task and put them on different menus. There was no prioritizing tasks and very limited short-cuts.3. More recent versions of i-Drive are based on a combination of prioritized menus and standard buttons, making for an easier to use/simplified interface4. The design changes with each iteration and with each model (3ser,5ser,7ser) so there is little consistency between models/revisions, so there is a learning curve with each edition.  Yep.60-70% of the time, I use voice control in my TL (the picture is from 2008 Accord). The rest is done via touch screen (unfortunately, no longer an option in the new Accord).  I will take well placed, easy to read buttons over anything that remotely resembles i-Drive or a jog dial.For folks that are intimidated by buttons (and the count of), I feel touch-screen menu may be the better way to go. Select function then have the buttons related to it on the screen. It is the way I control audio controls in my TL. The buttons below the screen are redundant and could be used when at a complete stop (or if anything goes wrong with LCD over time).I read somewhere that Audi/VW is planning use of touch screen dash. Great idea. Although, I hope there is also some room for fall back option. After 6-7 years, I don\\'t want to learn that there is no way to control features if the touch screen dies (like those small digital cameras that are getting rid of optical view finders in favor of LCD/EVF... the LCD breaks, the camera is rendered virtually useless).  I *hate* let, me emphasize, *hate* voice activation. I don\\'t know if the 750 had it or not, but I wouldn\\'t use it if it did.  Ford\\'s Sync supposedly has fantastic voice recognition/activation. I have not tried it yet.  Ford\\'s Sync supposedly has fantastic voice recognition/activation. I have not tried it yet. Me neither but I\\'ve heard the same thing and have watched several online demos and videos of Sync in action. If we get another Ford I\\'m definitely paying the $300 for Sync. I\\'m sold.What will the 2008 Accord voice commands control? Sync allows you to control everything from your bluetooth cell phone (which can be in your purse or pocket) right down to the mp3 player you have plugged into the USB port. That USB port allows you to get software/feature updates into the system using your own USB drive too IIRC. Pretty cool IMO.  60-70% of the time, I use voice control in my TL (the picture is from 2008 Accord)Voice is a good option, especially when it works correctly. The car is a horrible place to try to do sound recognition, it requires expensive mics and noise canceling software, etc.The rest is done via touch screen (unfortunately, no longer an option in the new Accord).Touchscreen = eyes off road time. No tactile feedback that your finger is on the button, or that it pressed the button means you have to look every time. A real button is a ballistic motion for your body. Even in my 3 mo old Accord the main radio controls are operated by touch not by looking.

Pretty cool IMO.Due to a somewhat sudden change of events, the Accord is likely to get flipped for a Fusion or Focus, and whatever I get will have Sync. I am anxious to try it out.  My Sebring with MyGIG has voice activation that works great. I think I remember reading in the manual that it has a 1,000 word vocabulary. It\\'s fun to play with as I cruise along. The Bluetooth phone interface also works fine. I recently read some comments that others were having trouble getting their systems to recognize their cell phones.  Voice Recognition works! That is why I rely on it a lot. The new Accord\\'s is even better (than my TL), especially when it comes to NAV related functions. The only challenge happens when someone \"naughty\" happens to be in the car, who takes pleasure in confusing the system.As for touch screen, it isn\\'t as better than an intuitively laid out dash, but it reduces number of \"buttons\" by getting only the selections related to function you chose. I agree, real buttons are better, but not always. They need to be laid out well, and distinctly marked (that they require no more than a glance, just like it would be with touch screen), and can be felt with a little learning. That takes me back to Honda, and why I feel they know how to get those little things done, well (but apparently, few recognize the point of having mostly dedicated buttons). Take a look here again...Voice Recognition works! Thats why I rely on it for most part. The new Accord\\'s is even better (than my TL), especially when it comes to NAV related functions.As for touch screen, it isn\\'t as better than an intuitively laid out dash (again, tough to beat Honda there, although, it is quite a challenge in my TL to figure out the buttons), but it drastically reduces eyes off the road when I want to use it (which is usually when I\\'m at a light/stopped). The best bet is with buttons that are not only grouped well but \"feel\" different than others.- Well marked, easy to read buttons- Logically grouped- Multi-push buttons (like fan speed, category, skip, scan etc) have notches at the end to differentiate from others (that can be \"felt\" so with a little learning, the driver can simply position the finger and operate them).Here is another example of thoughtful design (note the presence of dots)...And of course, the buttons on the steering wheel. They are distinctly designed, large enough and easy to read. One of the problems I have had with my TL is between bluetooth selection and voice activation buttons in that they look/feel very similar. Honda addressed that with the new Accord. Now bluetooth selection is flush with the spoke on the rim and voice activation button stays put.  The 2008 Accord joins the Legacy as the only mid-sized family sedans that are IIHS \"top picks\", meaning they scored \"Good\" in front, side, and rear crash tests and have ESC at least optional (but standard on the Accord).http://www.iihs.org/news/rss/pr111507.htmlOne question, though: I wonder why the IIHS tested the Accord thoroughly within a month of its introduction, yet the Altima\\'s been out for a year and hasn\\'t been tested by the IIHS for side crashes yet, nor has the Optima, which has been out for over a year and a half in its present form? It\\'s not like the Altima isn\\'t a popular seller. The Optima less so, but it sells more units than many other cars that the IIHS has managed to squeeze into their test schedule in the past 18 months. Interesting...  What about the Sonata? Are these cars not on the list because they weren\\'t tested, or because they didn\\'t make the \"top safety pick\" cut?  In the case of both the new Camry, and now the new Accord, IIHS test results are posted almost immediately after official introduction. This begs the question: Is this because of their respective popularity and sales, or payola on the part of manufacturers? No other vehicle or manufacturer results are fast-tracked in this fashion.   Sonata not listed in that news release because it is not a \"top safety pick\" (or \"also ran\"). It is listed here: http://www.iihs.org/ratings/summary.aspx?class=30with \"acceptable\" for side, that is why it did not make the list.  Conspiracy theory, again! :sick: Of the sixteen vehicles listed in that link (previous post), only one is from 2007 (Kia Optima). 2008 Accord and Camry have been out for couple of months but 2008 Malibu is the newest, and still found itself being tested. Payola?  Well not exactly. It looks like the rear and side impact crash tests were not performed on the 2008 Malibu. Side impact was not tested on the new Altima. Seems fishy to me.  Quit whining. Were Accord and Camry the only cars tested? Do you think they are not interested in testing the newest entries? (then why do they have even the front ratings in yet?)  Correct. The Malibu is only there (for frontal impact) because GM did the test--which is the case for most IIHS frontal tests now, if the previous design did well in that test. But IIHS itself does the side and rear tests.The current Altima has been out for about a year now and has not been tested for side impact by the IIHS. The 2006.5 Optima came out in 1H 2006 and hasn\\'t been crashed in the side yet either. (And that\\'s significant because if it were to get a Good score on the side crash test, it would be a \"Top Pick.\") Yet the Accord and Camry get near-immediate testing. And they should--they are popular cars and many people (like me) want to know how they fare in crash tests before buying. But the Altima is one of the top-selling cars, as is the Malibu. IIHS also hasn\\'t tested (side) some other cars that debuted last year but sell in significant numbers, e.g. the mid-sized (interior wise) Elantra and Sentra. Just kind of curious.  how many \\'stars\\' any given vehicle gets in a crash test? The point being that such things very rarely if ever happen -even though it is a big thing thing if it makes a difference. In my case, I\\'ve totalled one car in about 30 yeras of driving, and even that was a case of me being hit hard form the rear - nothing would have saved that particular car and I fortunately was unhurt. A truly SAFE car has more to do with how well it brakes, handles, and/or how much power it has - in that order, and less to do with how well it hits anything. The ability to avoid that accident being the key thing...  seen the interior of a new 2008 Malibu yet? The photos I\\'ve seen make me think of a circus. Maybe it\\'s not that bad in person. Anyone have any thoughts on this topic?  > brakes, handles, and/or how much power it has - in that order,I agree with you about those factors play above the stars in a staged test. Your collision may not be the same as the staged test therefore a 6 star ability may be only a 2 star crush for your. I am think I agree on your order of those factors.I watched a collision of two cars Saturday. Brakes made the collision a whole lot less energy. The young, inexperienced driver hit the brakes for a good second of screaching rubber and burned off a lot of energy. The Saturn rear end was admirable in handlig the collision and the front of the Cobalt RS absorbed the 35-40 mph without appearing to move the front cradle--the wheels looked in place.A more experienced driver would have steered right onto the berm and low ditch and gone around the Saturn who had started to move forward upon seeing the driver behind not stopping. The Cobalt stayed straight with the braking and probably could have steered off to the right. and gone around. The 17-year old was so startled he probably had no brain at that time other than brakes and stay on the road. He probably felt he was a great driver before the accident but didn\\'t realize the lack of training and always looking or the out in case of an accident. Just had a kid go through a good driver training course where that was emphasized continually---the out in case of the unexpected.The 17-year old showed no contrition as mom and a younger brother picked him up in an older van. His body language looked like he was having a good time. Oh, the accident was because he was digging for, reaching for a cell phone. Yes, I take straight braking ability with antilocks as most important. Handling overall is second. But handling doesn\\'t mean ability to turn corners at 50 mph in city streets and taking curves at 30 over the marked speed; it means keeping its feet when a car is asked to do avoidance maneuvers. It doesn\\'t have to be graceful while doing it--just capable.  IIHS testing doesn\\'t rate based on stars (NHTSA does that). IIHS testing is more towards helping insurance companies figure out \"liabilities\" in a car.I can\\'t speak for IIHS since it is just another safety rating system but since you brought it up, NHTSA\\'s star rating has some holes that I noticed. For example, side crash test rating measures injury in three areas (head, chest and pelvic) in terms of forces subjected to each of them. However, in their final rating system, they use only chest. A car doing marginally better in protecting chest, but significantly worse than another in protecting head and pelvic area would get 5-stars but the other would get 4-stars. I\\'ve yet to figure out why they would measure three, but use one.  Yes, I care about how much protection a car provides in a crash. I also care about how well the car stops, steers, and moves. But when driving in traffic, there\\'s always the chance that someone will hit my car no matter what I do to avoid it. Another thing to consider is that I\\'m not the only person who will drive my next car. Most likely my wife and kids will drive it sometimes, and I\\'ll hand it down to my daughter in a few years for college. So I want the most active and passive safety I can get in a mid-sized family car. I\\'ll take a \"Good\" crash test score over a lesser score any day, even if it improves my odds of walking out of a crash without serious injury only a little bit.  phone he was gonna text-message on it. It\\'s bad enough to have people exhibit that \"spaced-out\" glare and dorky, buzzed-out driving we have to live with when they\\'re driving and talking on their cell-phones at the same time. But when they text-message while driving that is heightened stupidity personified.  Yes, I care about how much protection a car provides in a crash. I also care about how well the car stops, steers, and movesas we all do - but given \\'safety\\' also generally comes with a size and weight penalty, are you willing to sacrifice some of that evasive capability for some better performance in some industry (or governmental) crash test.? Any one of those attributes (braking/handling/power) we use most every day, how often do any of us hit anything hard enough even to get the airbags to deploy? The obvious \\'duh\\' answer to that has to be \\'it only has to happen once\\' but my question is do we really and truly disqualify an otherwise good car just because the NHTSA for example has decided that you don\\'t want to get hit in a certain manner?  Like everything else, it can\\'t be the sole reason, but can be one of the major reasons.Would you buy a car that had excellent dynamic ability but structurally challenged in crash tests for yourself and family?  how often do any of us hit anything hard enough even to get the airbags to deploy?Once would be more than enough. I\\'ve never done it, but my oldest son has. I\\'m glad that car had frontal airbags. No injury except a little scrape on one arm.  I think crash testing is necessary because it makes sure the cars are as safe as they can be. How well a car maneuvers can also make it safer than another. How large a vehicle is also helps in crashes. Each person has to decide how important these things are to him/her. Personally, I will not buy an Excursion or Hummer, because I have a better chance of surviving a crash in one. I would rather go with a car that maneuvers better, and maybe avoid a collision with less chance of a rollover. If I have a decision to make between two cars, and one car does better on crash testing, and the other may maneuver a little better, I will take the better crash test score.  IIRC, all vehicles sold after September 1, 2007 are required to have NHTSA ratings displayed on the window.  I assume you\\'re talking about the 2 tone brown interior. It\\'s much better in person.  I agree that it is strange that IIHS has not bothered to test the Altima, particularly since IIHS says in their FAQ that: We try to cover as much of the marketplace as we can, choosing vehicles to test that represent a range of manufacturers and the largest portions of new car sales. You\\'d think the a model with sales of 200,000+, and the third biggest selling midsize (and 8th best selling vehicle, overall) would have fit in their schedule at some time in the last year. :confuse:  If I read it right (from IIHS), they did start with Altima frontal crash test which failed to deploy thorax/curtain airbags when done by Nissan. Eventually, IIHS conducted a second test on it (hence the rating) when it worked fine. So, there might have been a delay for that reason. It has also been rated for rear impact safety. Side crash hasn\\'t been done yet.I also noticed they don\\'t test every model every year. This is the first time since 2004 that Accord has been tested for side impact. In fact, Fusion is perhaps the only cars in the list tested two years in a row (2006, 2007).  I also noticed they don\\'t test every model every year. This is the first time since 2004 that Accord has been tested for side impact.That\\'s because the last \"new\" model was in \\'03, and it doesn\\'t make any sense for the IIHS to retest a car that hasn\\'t been significantly revised.In fact, Fusion is perhaps the only cars in the list tested two years in a row (2006, 2007). The Fusion is the exception in this case, because in \\'06, they only tested a non-airbag equipped model, and received poor ratings because of it. In \\'07, Ford had it tested again with side airbags and the results improved because of it.  I assume you\\'re talking about the 2 tone brown interior. It\\'s much better in person.The one I saw in a photo was orange (lighter color) and brown. According to reviews, several color combinations will be available.  The one I saw in a photo was orange (lighter color) and brown. According to reviews, several color combinations will be available. I looked at the different color combinations, and none of them seemed right. All of the colors seem strange/odd (colors I\\'ve never seen before). Who wants an Orange interior?  Just returned form the Post Office. As I walked out I hit the remote start button on my Aura XR keyfob. The engine started like always, but this time there was a man walking between my car and his, 2008 Jaguar 3.0 sedan, in BRG :shades: He stopped dead in his tracks, staring into my car. I walked up and hit the unlock button when he said, your car started itself. I smiled and said Yup. It likes to do that when it see\\'s me coming. He said, expletive deleted, I just paid $63000 for this new Jag and it doesn\\'t do that. Shaking his head as he got in his beautiful Jag.I got in and chuckled to myself knowing he could have bought three Aura XR\\'s for the price of his (Ford) British tin. :shades:  What is the benefit of starting the car with remote as you are walking toward it instead of turning the ignition key? Do you still have to put the key in the ignition before you can drive the car?  I think that same button also inflates a few things.   I think the main benefit of remote start is that you can start it from a distance, while you remain warm (or cool) inside. That could be a benefit for people who live in really cold or hot climates. It\\'s something I can live without, even though it can get really cold (and really hot) where I live, but there\\'s clearly a lot of people who like this feature, since there\\'s quite a market for third-party remote car starters.  Yep. And it starts with defeating an anti-theft feature that is now common in many cars (immobilizer).   I think the remote start is a really useful feature. I start my Aura XR from the inside of my office about 5 minutes before I am ready to leave for home. When I get to my car, it\\'s toasty warm and ready to start driving immediately.  Yes, you do have to put the key in the ignition and turn in to the \\'on\\' position before the car will drive.  I hope you (or anybody else) don\\'t do that when the car is parked inside the garage in the house. For me, get in and drive is the better idea. It takes a little over a half mile for my cars in cold weather to warm up when running and rolling, and less than that in warmer weather. Excessive idling is not only waste of fuel, it isn\\'t good for engines in the long term (if that is a part of the plan with the ownership), and takes several minutes to get the same effect.  No, I don\\'t do it in the garage. I noticed you live in Dallas, so I can\\'t imagine cold weather starting is as much of an issue for you as it is for us folks in Ohio. I said 5 minutes but actually it\\'s probably only 2 or 3 minutes.  I have lived in Columbus (Ohio) and, better, in Minneapolis.  Excessive idling is not only waste of fuel, it isn\\'t good for engines in the long termDoesn\\'t seem to be very environmentally friendly either. But I sure would use the feature when leaving from work as I live in Wisconsin.  Strange. Given your login name I can\\'t help but be reminded of Robert Smith the football player who played for the Ohio State Buckeyes (Columbus), then the Minnesota Vikings (Minneapolis)... Also happy the Bucks beat Michigan...again.I had always heard that it was generally not good for your engine to start it up in the cold then start driving right away bofore the oil was warm and flowing.  He said, expletive deleted, I just paid $63000 for this new Jag and it doesn\\'t do that.

Ah yes, but for $55.99, he too can have the advanced Saturn technology:Valiant Remote Car Starter  On the contrary, Honda\\'s recommendation on my 1998 Accord was to idle for no longer than 30s, as the car warms up faster. The one caution is to not be overly aggressive with throttle until the engine reaches operating temperature.So, a typical idle time for me has been 15-20s. May be longer if I had to scrape ice/snow.  Who wants an Orange interior?Maybe a witch, ghost, goblin so it can be Halloween 365 days a year instead of just one.   On the contrary, Honda\\'s recommendation on my 1998 Accord was to idle for no longer than 30s, as the car warms up faster. The one caution is to not be overly aggressive with throttle until the engine reaches operating temperature.I concur, you want to wait until the engine has oil pressure, which for a modern engine, is almost instantaneous. Then the vehicle should be driven conservatively until everything (oil, mostly) reaches operating temperature. A couple of other things as well - excessive idling is very hard on a motor and emissions systems. Idling leads to carbon build up in the cylinders and can hurt spark plug performance. Also, keeping the car in cold start makes the catalytic converter have to work harder.Oh, and lastly, when the engine is running and the car isn\\'t moving, that is 0 mpg.  Maybe a witch, ghost, goblin so it can be Halloween 365 days a year instead of just one.LOL! :P  Just because the engine starts and is running doesn\\'t mean the security system is deactivated. You still have to unlock the door and put the key in the ignition and turn it to release the trans mission lock, steering lock and turn on the instrument panel.It does run the heater or A/C as set before the car was turned off.  One can get remote start installed in virtually any car, and in cars like the Accord which come with engine immobilizer, the feature needs to be taken out. In other words, AFAIK, remote start and engine immobilizer are mutually exclusive.  You don\\'t \"take out\" the anti-theft system - you just store a previously programmed key (or just the electronics piece of the key) near the ignition. At least that\\'s how most remote start systems get around it.  If I lived in an area where cars are stolen often, I would not want to effectively disable the immobilizer system, just for the luxury of remote start. Seems like that would also affect the insurance rates.  Engine immobilizer function is designed to identify the key in the slot to start the engine. On the contrary, remote start systems often (and should) have a security system built-in that ensures key is not in the slot when remote start is activated. Another security concern is around servicing. The service personnel needs to be aware of remote start feature (or service mode activate) to prevent accidental start while the car is being serviced (or even being looked at home).  I\\'m not aware that my insurance rates have been adversely affected by the remote start feature. If you have any actual doccumentation of this, I would be interested in seeing it.In fact, the National Insurance Crime Bureau cited the 1991 Honda Accord as the most frequently stolen car in the U.S. in 2005. No Saturns were on the top 10 list.  So it\\'s basically replacing one security system, with another. :confuse: And how do these systems prevent theft?  In fact, the National Insurance Crime Bureau cited the 1991 Honda Accord as the most frequently stolen car in the U.S. in 2005. No Saturns were on the top 10 list.That\\'s more of a reflection of Saturn\\'s dismal sales numbers.  The Accord\\'s arch-rival, the Camry, has outsold it over the past several years. Does that fact alone make the Camry a better car? If so, then why didn\\'t you buy a Camry? If not, then I\\'m not sure where this argument fits in the conversation. \\'The masses\\' aren\\'t always right, like when the masses of Germany followed Hitler. I\\'m not going to pick a car just because it has good sales figures.  I\\'m not sure why it matters, but actually the 1993 Saturn SL comes in at #9 on the list.Interesting that all the most stolen cars are old, except for the 2004 Dodge Ram. The two Toyotas on the list are from the 1980s :surprise: .  I stand corrected... Guess maybe Saturn sales aren\\'t so dismal.The point, though, is that I\\'m not really sure whether having a remote starter or adding one is really going to make it more likely that your car will be stolen. Professional thieves obviously go after popular makes of older cars so they can sell parts. If a professional thief really wants your car, he is going to get it regardless. If your car has OnStar, though, the car\\'s location can be tracked via satellite. I\\'m under the impression (by OnStar\\'s advertising) that it is not that easy to disable this tracking feature.The immobilizer system is not going to prevent your car from being loaded onto the flatbed of a truck and hauled away. From there, they don\\'t even need to drive the car to get what they really want - the parts.  Interesting where this thread has gone from a simple statement of giddy happiness. The interesting part is all the discussions around security. Guess it might not be wise to add a remote start to a Honda. I believe the Saturn maintains full security even after the engine is started. If I left the window down and set the alarm then started the car remotely, opening the door by reaching inside and lifting the lock button and pulling the handle, I believe the alarm will sound.Haven\\'t tested this yet but I will. If not, someone would still have to pop the keyswitch and jump the correct wires to get the systems to activate the trans-lock, and dash electronics.Don\\'t think I will worry about it since after I start the engine I am in the car within a minute or less. Oh! If the right wires are not connected in the ignition switch, the 10 minute timer will shut the engine off, So I suspect if it was stolen, the thief would only get a few blocks to a mile away when the engine dies.  I could be wrong but I doubt the key has to be in the slot - it\\'s typically just a close proximity RFID reader that can be satisfied by taping a key anywhere close to the ignition switch. Of course without remote start or keyless go you can\\'t do anything without turning the key so it wouldn\\'t be of any use.  So...how far away does everyone\\'s remote work? I have a factory remote start in my Sebring and I\\'ve tried it from 660 ft away inside the building where I work to the far end of the parking lot and it starts right up. This will come in very handy on frosty winter days when there is ice buildup on the windshield.Also, as far as the security goes, mine automatically locks the doors if I use the remote to start it. When I then unlock the door and get in I have around 30 seconds to insert the key and turn it to ON or the engine shuts off.  The Accord\\'s arch-rival, the Camry, has outsold it over the past several years. Does that fact alone make the Camry a better car? If so, then why didn\\'t you buy a Camry? If not, then I\\'m not sure where this argument fits in the conversation.The point was that the Accord has been a consistent big seller and therefore is likely to make the top ten list of stolen cars. Saturns by contrast have been a big sales disappoint over the years and are not likely going to be on such lists. That\\'s how the argument fits into the conversation. How you construe what I said meant that high volume vehicles are therefore better cars is beyond me. And why you would bring Hitler into the discussion from such a tongue and cheek remark is way beyond me.  If your car has OnStar, though, the car\\'s location can be tracked via satellite. I\\'m under the impression (by OnStar\\'s advertising) that it is not that easy to disable this tracking feature.I believe this is also the case with vehicles equipped with Navigation systems. Rental car companies also install GPS systems in their vehicles so if you cross a state line they can charge you an arm and a leg.  While it\\'s true the navigation system knows where you are, unless the vehicle has the ability to transmit it\\'s location then it can\\'t be tracked. A nav system alone won\\'t give you this feature.  I just checked on the College Hill Honda\\'s ( a dealer in Ohio) accessory website and it seems that Honda now has a \"gen-u-wine\" Honda remote starter for use with 2006-08 Civics and 2008 Accords. These vehicles all have an engine immobilizer but the text states that an engine module (possibly the immobilizer module) requires a dealer reflash... so never say never because I doubt Honda would recommend defusing one anti-theft feature (the immobilizer) to install this. It is, by the way, $388.80 and additional transmitters are $108.  Professional thieves obviously go after popular makes of older cars so they can sell parts.Is it really professional thieves that are stealing things like 14 year old accords and 16 year old camrys? How much can parts off of these old beaters be worth? I was speculating that maybe old cars are stolen more often just because they can be more easily stolen and taken on a \"joy ride\" than newer ones???Of course the raw statistics on the number stolen is going to be greater for those cars that have bigger sales, in general. That list tells you nothing about the theft rate. They do have another list of 5 vehicles with the highest theft claims per 1,000 insured vehicles among 2003 - 2005 models...the only midsize on that list is the 2004-05 Sebring.Linked below is an IIHS document that also shows Sebring #1 for theft losses among midsize. Saturn LS had lowest losses, BTW:http://www.iihs.org/research/hldi/ictl_pdf/ictl_0906.pdf  Theft for parts largely happens if the older car still promises to have parts that is in good condition, commands a value and will not have trouble finding a place in its new &#147;home&#148;  As was pointed out, I was mistaken and the Saturn SL DID make the list, so goes your argument.  What was your argument?  My point was that, statistically, having or adding a remote start to a late model car probably is not going to make it any more likely to be stolen. Most stolen cars are older cars that are stolen for parts. I imagine there is a high demand for parts of 10-15 year old cars, since they tend to break down more and their parts may not be as readily available. Thieves who know what cars they want are not even going to be able to tell that your car has a remote start by looking at it.  Well I checked. With the alarm activated, I started my Aura XR remotely, then I opened the door and the alarm (horns) started blasting immediately. I disarmed the alarm entered the car, inserted the key which activated the systems.I doubt most after market remote start systems would have any effect on the alarm unless they are activated by electrical system load sensors.  Don\\'t think I will worry about it since after I start the engine I am in the car within a minute or lessSaving one minute of time warming up the engine is the value of remote start.Awesome. I think I\\'m feeling giddy.  I think not being on the top ten most stolen list is also a reflection of having a car that doesn\\'t last, and therefore, stolen parts will not be needed for cars that no longer run or function.  I rather have a really good keyless system than the remote start.But again, I live in LA so there goes the cold/hot weather argument...  I am looking forward to a passive entry key on my next vehicle. Keys are so 90s. I want to walk up to the car, have it sense my key, move my seat, wheel and mirrors to my favorite spots, update my radio presets, and maybe turn on the lights if its dark.  ... drive and brake itself. Much of it sounds like something one would do for a new date. :P  A lot of (if not all) what you\\'ve said can be done with today\\'s keyless entry/start systems.  ... drive and brake itself.Nah, if I wanted to feel like I wasn\\'t driving, I\\'d keep my Honda :P Much of it sounds like something one would do for a new dateAnd if you do it on every date, love will stay fresh...yada yada yada :P  A lot of (if not all) what you\\'ve said can be done with today\\'s keyless entry/start systems.I know, its not expensive technology, I was a little surprised my car didn\\'t have it. I also don\\'t see a lot of domestics with that feature. My MIL has it on her Prius and my boss has it on his MS6 and they both really like it.  But your Honda never treated you like you were its date, right? After all, the only thing you missed was the car laying down a red carpet for you. :shades:  Rubbish......older cars that sold well in their time are targets simply and only because they were sold in volume and statistically more are left. The rear wheel drive Olds Cutlass from the 80\\'s was always on the most stolen list. I don\\'t believe it was a paragon for reliability. Is this comment some new way of telling us, yet again, that the Accord being on the list (previous lists anyhow) is there because it is so reliable??? It is there because it sold well and there are lots to be stolen. If it was a reliability issue NO Honda\\'s would be stolen...ever... because, as we know, they never break down and therefore need no parts.  I just knew a certain someone would chime in turning theft statistics into a reliability measure  .Funny thing, though...one can get a state specific list from cars.com. For my state (WI), the top 10 most stolen, with their rankings, include:1. 1992 Oldsmobile Cutlass 2. 1990 Buick LeSabre5. 1990 Buick Century 7. 1990 Oldsmobile Delta 88 8. 1995 Ford Taurus 9. 1994 Dodge Caravan 10. 1988 Chevrolet Cavalier I\\'m thinking the \\'88 cavalier is on the list because they are left unlocked with keys in the ignition...the owner thinking \"who would bother to steal a 17 year old cavalier\"  .  The stat isn\\'t based on volume, but based on per 100 cars (I think). That said, not all thefts may be for parts, but that can be assumed for most cases. In case of Hondas, you have to couple longevity and compatibility.It was with 1998 Accord that Honda got very serious about it. An example is the audio system. It was beginning of a new era that has led to more integrated (and unique) systems since then, and virtually no compatibility going from one generation to another. You could take stereo out of a 1991 Accord and put it in 1997 Accord, or even a 2000 Civic. You can\\'t take 1998 Accord\\'s stereo out (first of all, it is anti-theft coded, but even if you get past it), you can\\'t simply put it in a 2003 or 2008. That has limited the appeal.Similar case can be made for engine, and most other parts.  My dealer is telling me I need new rear brakes, pads, etc. after only 25000 miles. I was expecting them to last at least 40k miles. It is going to cost me over $300 for just the rear brakes. When questioned he said they are worn down and rusted. Is this common for these cars?  Aren\\'t you covered by the car warranty?  What is rusted? If the dealer is talking about a rusted rotor, it sounds like one of your calipers is not working. On the other hand, all your brake rotors will rust when exposed to water. The brake pads will remove the rust when the brakes are applied. The overall wear would depend mostly on your driving style. If you\\'re hard on brakes, you might try a different pad.  Rear brakes should out last the fronts 2 or 3 to 1. ABS is one thing that can make rear brake pads wear out faster than normal. I would suspect that there is a PROBLEM with the ABS system which should be a warranty covered system. If the calipers are rusted, that would be a factory material defect and should be a warranty covered part. The only thing not covered by most new car warranties would be the pads (and labor).I would immediately take my car to a brake shop and get a second opinion from an expert. No way should pad replacement cost $300.Good luckOh! Happy Thanks-giving too  25K is way too early, more so for rear brake pads. How much life are they estimating is left on the front pads? If you can believe it, my 1998 Accord\\'s pads lasted 90K miles (front) and 132K miles (rear). At 184K miles, those are the only times they have been replaced but they both seem due for replacement soon.But, did they say you needed more than brake pads? Then, you might be able to ask for warranty coverage. I can see pads being a wear and tear item and not covered, but if it involves rotors or something else, ask them.  But not the Malibu--the CTS. GM\\'s first MT COTY in a decade. The 2008 Accord and Malibu were finalists, however. What was interesting that in MT\\'s scoring system, the Malibu out-pointed the Accord. The link below takes you to the reports on the Accord and Malibu.http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/car/112_0801_2008_car_of_the_year_finalists  Shouldn\\'t there have been a spoiler alert in that subject line? I subscribe to MT.I\\'ll be sure and check out the article when it gets to my house.  Maybe you should talk to MT about publishing the COTY results on the Web for all to see before paying customers like you hear about it.   Perhaps I read the article too quickly. Where does it indicate where the vehicles finished in Motor Trend\\'s scoring system? I noticed the vehicles were listed in alphabetical order but that\\'s not an indication of the order they finished.The A5 got robbed.  Well deserved!!  Doesn\\'t sound right under normal driving conditions.I\\'d suggest getting a second opinion if possible; you may also head over to the Sonata forum and check out if anyone else has had this issue:http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/WebX/.ef14c39/?ed_displayMakeModelRelatedDiscus- sions!make=Hyundai&model=Sonata  If you look at the reviews of each car, you can see how MT scored each car in various categories. The Malibu got higher \"star\" scores overall than the Accord, where 5 stars is the top score. Across the 7 categories, Malibu averaged 4.3 and Accord 4.0 stars. Also Malibu got no lower than 4 stars in any category, whereas the Accord got one 2 and one 3, in addition to some 4s and 5s.So my prediction awhile back that the Malibu could take the MT COTY over the Accord was wrong, but in a way partly on target in that it did top all other mid-sized family cars, including the Accord. :shades:  Except for sensing my key,my 97 Chrysler Town & Country LXi could do that,so it\\'s old technology.You could program 2 seat and mirror settings, and depending on which remote you used they would adjust themselves.  According to GM Inside News the \\'Bu beat the Accord but the CTS beat the \\'Bu. I\\'d probably agree with that, although MT\\'s selections have been head scratchers in some past years.  See 7467.  Except for sensing my key,my 97 Chrysler Town & Country LXi could do that,so it\\'s old technology.You could program 2 seat and mirror settings, and depending on which remote you used they would adjust themselvesYeah, why doesn\\'t the Accord do that? Or a Fusion? Why do we need to push a button on the key chain to make it work?   If it was a reliability issue NO Honda\\'s would be stolen...ever... because, as we know, they never break down and therefore need no parts.Your theory would be great if every driver out there was like me and as good at me at not getting into accidents. HOwever, since the reality is that I\\'ve had a few of my Honda parts damaged by other drivers on the road from collisions, stolen parts could come in handy if I was into that sort of thing.   What exactly is special about the Malibu anyway ? Basically a CHEVY version of the sales dud Saturn AURA. It certainly isn\\'t the most powerful midsize sedan. The V6 Camry outpowers the Malibu and gets better gas mileage while both the I4 and V6 Accord outpowers the MALIBU by nearly 20 horspower while getting better gas mileage. ME thinks MOTOR TREND was just feeling sorry for GM for ignoring them for so long. I consider it a pity prize for GM.  Did you read the article? The Malibu did 0-60 in 6.4 seconds, while the Accord V6 took 6.6 sec. Not sure why you are saying the V6 Accord \\'outpowers\\' the Malibu when in fact in a race it would be looking at the Malibu\\'s taillights. The Malibu has a 6-speed auto while the Accord has a 5-speed unit.The article also mentions Saturn\\'s \\'hot-selling\\' Aura.  There has been a bit of discussion of keyless ignition systems in multiple midsize sedan models. Why I would not purchase a car with a keyless ignition system.  In motown\\'s defense, the Accord does outpower the Malibu. He didn\\'t say it was faster.  There has been a bit of discussion of keyless ignition systems in multiple midsize sedan models. Why I would not purchase a car with a keyless ignition system.And when insurance rates go up for vehicles equipped with such devices, I will worry. A few obscure postings on the internet about an elite group of hackers isn\\'t enough to concern me. If I was that worried, I wouldn\\'t have RKE or a garage door opener either.I guess that is a risk I am willing to accept, since it provides quite a bit of convenience and is of no cost to me (other than requiring the option package).  It\\'s not a few obscure postings on the internet. I heard this on major network news first and couldn\\'t believe it, but couldn\\'t find a reference. This is one reference, but the issue IMO, just like the issue with stolen HID Acura headlamp assemblies, is real.  No one here has said the Malibu is faster than the Accord. But in MT\\'s tests, the Malibu was a bit quicker 0-60. Just proves again that performance is not all about horsepower, even though there seems to be a fixation on that even with mid-sized family cars. :confuse: Maybe the Malibu\\'s 6-speed AT helps it be quicker than the Accord even with fewer horses under the hood.  It\\'s not a few obscure postings on the internet. I heard this on major network news first and couldn\\'t believe it, but couldn\\'t find a reference. This is one reference, but the issue IMO, just like the issue with stolen HID Acura headlamp assemblies, is real.Thats not how news works. If it happened every day all the time, it wouldn\\'t be news would it? If it happens once then its news. If a baby is born, its typically not on the news...if a baby is born with an extra set of limbs, thats news.It been around for years...there was a CHiPs episode (so that was early 80s at the latest...I\\'m pretty sure it was CHiPs) about \"hackers\" stealing alarm codes for keyless entry systems and garage door openers.When the raise insurance rates for vehicles equipped with such systems, I will worry about it.  When the raise insurance rates for vehicles equipped with such systems, I will worry about itDifferent strokes. It concerns me enough my next ride won\\'t have one until this issue is resolved.  I worry more about folks who want to drive but can\\'t press a button to open the door. Or, may be driving itself is a chore to those folks. They might prefer a chauffeur if they could afford one.I still remember, back in 1999 when S2000 came out, folks called the start button a gimmick. And while it wasn\\'t about keyless ignition, now it appears many (if not all) of those folks find it a pain to not have a start button.  0-60 isn\\'t solely about power. It is about gearing. Malibu is likely geared to run 60-61 mph at redline in second gear. This is about as optimum as a car could be designed to impress when it comes to 0-60, which is a guaranteed measurement by any automotive source (its validity is a whole another issue). Accord will pull 75-76 mph in second gear. That has been typical of Honda unless mated to manual transmission, and not the \"setting\" that one should place bets on for optimum 0-60 run.Accord does have more power, but the power that it gets to use only during high speed acceleration (as opposed to around town driving, or even 0-60 run). It can also be seen in higher trap speed thru quarter mile.But more importantly, Accord\\'s V6 w/VCM isn\\'t tuned for stop light drag racing. The cam profile selection is compromised in favor of improving fuel economy (via VCM). Under 4000 rpm, it behaves more like a 3.2-liter V6 than a 3.5, much less a larger 3.6. It is beyond the \"VCM point\" (around 4000 rpm) that the engine goes all out. This is by design. Without VCM (Accord V6/6MT), we already know, that there is no such compromise and it goes for all out performance.   So many excuses to explain away Accord\\'s slower times...The point is the Malibu/Aura ARE worthy of awards like MT COTY and North American Car of the Year because they do compete well with the Camcords of the world, including performance catagories. The GM cars (finally) have a modern DOHC engine that produces overall acceleration times in the same ballpark as the foreign competition. They have also improved handling (skidpad 0.82 for GM cars vs 0.80 for Accord) and improved overall quality.  Excuses? How about the realities?BTW, handling isn\\'t \"seen\" in skidpad numbers. So, don\\'t even start a debate on that or how MT worked on pick and choose for the award that makes little sense... in fact, a of the few objective measures is always going to play against practicality oriented vehicles, like it did against Caravan. How was it supposed to win? Given the criterias, it makes no sense to include a vehicle that can\\'t \"perform\".  The GM cars have an extra cog in the transmission compared to the Accord (6 vs 5). This probably accounts for being closer to redline around 60 mph in 2nd gear than the Accord is. It\\'s a simple advantage of having an extra gear. It\\'s going out on a limb to say the gearing was done intentionally specifically for 0-60 times.I, too, want to stick with realities. That\\'s why we should focus on the realities that exist: test results. Motownusa was the one who suggested the Malibu was not worthy of the COTY award because it has a few less hp than the Camcords. I also believe the Dodge Caravan DID win the COTY award back in 1996.  The idea that this car has a motor that\\'s rated at 5 more horsepower than the next car and that makes it a better car is a silly idea. It\\'s all in the torque and the characteristics of the graph of the torque vs. engine speed. The gearbox and overall gearing makes the difference as well, and that\\'s what people are saying here. It looks to me like Accord is behind with their 5-speed and needs to get with the plan to have a viable car! After listening to people criticism GM\\'s very capable 4-speeds It\\'s refreshing that the worm is turned.95% of the people buying a Camry, Malibu, Accord, etc., care about the 0-60 time for their daily and normal driving use of the car because they\\'re never going to use it. Most of us drive the cars normally and much more conservatively. That\\'s the kind of driving capability that should be being compared.Most of us don\\'t drive around curving winding roads at the edge of traction limits for the tires. I care about how they hold in normal driving use. That\\'s what should be compared.I recognize there are some who want to feel their car is the best road-holding at 80 on a 50 mph curve car there is and that makes them feel better about driving it the 99.9% of the rest of the time. But some of these comparisons of \"mine is better than yourn is because ...\" just wastes bandwidth.Let\\'s hear about the practical uses of the midsized cars and how they compared there.  It looks to me like Accord is behind with their 5-speed and needs to get with the plan to have a viable car! Yeah, that 0.2 seconds behind the Malibu makes all the difference in the world. I guess having a car that\\'s on par in performance but delivering better fuel economy is not viable.I think what\\'s being missed here is that the Accord offers an I4 with V6 like performance. It doesn\\'t make the headlines like the 168 hp V6 but its power is more than sufficient.  Good idea - why don\\'t you get us started?  IMO the power of the I4s in all the mid-sized family cars is \"more than sufficient.\" We\\'re talking power in most cases (Camry excepted) of over 160 hp, which just a few years ago was what you got from a typical V6, or even a small V8. Does that surge of power you get when you plant the accelerator of a 260-270 hp V6 to the floor feel good? Sure. Is it worth the extra money, both up front (typical $1000-2000 price premium) and in gas and extra maintenance for the lifetime of the car? Not for me.I do question whether the I4 Accord offers comparable performance to that of the V6s that are common in today\\'s mid-sized sedans. For example, we know that some V6s in these cars (e.g. Camry, Malibu, Sonata, and of course the Accord) are capable of sub-7 seconds 0-60 with ATs. Can the I4s on the Accord do that, with an AT?  I do question whether the I4 Accord offers comparable performance to that of the V6s that are common in today\\'s mid-sized sedans.Good point. I guess I meant previous V6 engine output. I think the Accord\\'s 190 HP I4 is a nice compromise between power and fuel economy.  Not necessarily. RPM/Speed is determined by gear ratios, not by number of cogs. GM\\'s 6AT might pull 60-61 mph in second gear, but Toyota\\'s 6AT will pull 71-72 mph (in Camry). And Honda could have chosen to pull 60-62 mph but in the end, the choice is largely about tradeoffs.  I worry more about folks who want to drive but can\\'t press a button to open the door. How would they get in the car? You still have to open the door, you just dont have to spend 15 minutes digging your keys out of your jeans pocket, backpack, gym bag, purse, etc with your hands full of groceries, small children, large children, gifts for your spouse, etc. You take the card, you put it in your wallet (or attach it to your work ID or what not) and you\\'re done.  Maybe he would like it better if the door responded to voice commands, instead of simply opening by walking up to it, ala \"Driver\\'s door, open sesame!\" This is yet another feature I can live without, but I always thought I could live w/o remote locking until I got my first car so equipped several years ago. Now I wouldn\\'t want a car without it. Maybe I\\'d feel the same way about \"intelligent key\" if I had it for awhile. The more we have, the more we want.   I remember not that long ago, we were all talking about how buttons were arranged in these mid sized sedans, and how a few here thought that the Honda Accords were top knotch in basically every way possible. Well, it seems MT disagrees.....with statements like \"even the interior drew harsh criticism for it\\'s overly buttony center stack and cold appearance\"  I think what\\'s being missed here is that the Accord offers an I4 with V6 like performance. It doesn\\'t make the headlines like the 168 hp V6 but its power is more than sufficient.Did I miss something?What V6 car only has 168 HP and made headlines?Most of the V6\\'s in this discussion group are 240+ and the new Honda is 268 HP.So what Honda I-4 makes 268 HP? or 240HP? or 200HP?You would need to Turbo charge that little I-4 to equal the performance of the V-6\\'s in this group.Most of the V-6\\'s discussed here are getting 27 to 30 MPG and some more (one 3.5 L claimed 35 MPG). Acceleration may not be a nice to have feature in rural Minnesota, but in Southern California it can be life and death sometimes.   I would\\'ve said something but thought his typo was pretty obvious... He meant the 268hp Accord, and hit 168 by mistake.  Why then are small, low-powered cars like the Fit so popular in SoCal? I\\'d venture to guess any of the current crop of mid-sized I4 cars is at least as quick as the Fit, if not quicker. Personally I think the need for lots of horsepower in the name of safety is way overstated. I can\\'t think of one situation I\\'ve been in in over 35 years of driving in which extra horsepower would have helped me avoid an accident--with the exception of a couple of times when I passed a car (or tried to pass a car) when I shouldn\\'t have, and that was my fault and avoidable. I can think of times when my car\\'s handling and braking--along with paying attention behind the wheel--have been very important in avoiding an accident. Maybe because I drove low-powered cars for the first 20+ years of my driving experience, and mostly low-powered cars for the 15 years after that, I learned how to drive without needing lots of power to save me. That included a 100 hp I4 Caravan. I got my first speeding ticket driving that van.   Now I know where \"ideas\" come from. For the record, I don\\'t have trouble pressing a key to open/close the door. Somehow I feel, your idea will fail in favor of keyless ignition/unlock system... it takes more effort to speak while walking than to just walk. There you go, another \"idea\" thrown out the window. Now what may not... if the car feels you, opens the door, blinks the lights, rolls out a red carpet after having arranged everything inside, hands you a newspaper/magazine, prepares to launch, and drive you home!Then this person can chat about how we want more exciting cars and driving experience.  Count \\'em as folks who prefer conformity over ideas that make life easier. Form took over function in their assessment, exact contrast to what Edmunds and C&D have said about the same. I blame intimidation.  Thank you for pointing out that it was a typo error!It\\'s not like I made the assertion that the 08 Camry lost to the 08 Accord in a comparison test from Edmunds then provided a link from such a test conducted in March 06. Or that I described stability control as adjusting shock compression and rebound.  I didn\\'t think having 250+ HP in a mid-size sedan was a necessity no matter where you lived in the USA. Certainly not a life and death situation. Silly me for thinking that 190 HP is more than enough power for even southern California. It wasn\\'t too long ago that horsepower in the 190 HP range was considered good for a V6. Most notably that was the case for many GM mid-size V6 sedans from a generation ago.  Personally I think the need for lots of horsepower in the name of safety is way overstated. I agree...I\\'ll reconsider, if I start hearing of insurance discounts for the V6 version of a car over the I4. Pretty sure that\\'ll never happen. You are correct about cars like the Fit. In Dec. 2006, CR tested a crop of 5 small cars, including the Fit, in Dec. 2006. All were slower than most I4 midsizes. 0-60 ranged from 10.1 to 12.8 sec (the Fit was 12.4). In 45-65 passing test these cars were measured from 6.4 sec (Versa) to as slow as 8.4 sec (Fit). (these figures are for automatics)For comparison I4 automatic Milan/Fusion (which is not the fastest midsize I4) had 0-60 at 9.5 sec and 45-60 at 5.9, as measured by CR.  It\\'s not like I made the assertion that the 08 Camry lost to the 08 Accord in a comparison test from Edmunds then provided a link from such a test conducted in March 06.Oops, I meant:It\\'s not like I made the assertion that the 08 Accord lost to the 08 Camry in a comparison test from Edmunds then provided a link from such a test conducted in March 06.  Having a V6 engine is a LUXURY, and saying that is SAFER is a considerable reach. Some people are willing to pay more for the extra power, quietness, and smoothness of a V6 engine, and for some people the economy and lower cost of the I4 is more important. I thought the luxury of the V6 was worth it, and I\\'m sure thegraduate is happy with the lower cost and higher fuel economy of his I4. Everybody\\'s happy.   I agree.My \\'05 Sonata V6 has 170 HP and it has always been adequate. My brother has an \\'07 Sonata with 3.3L, 234 HP. He says it took him a few weeks to get used to going easier on the gas pedal than his previous Olds 98, 3.8L, 205 HP. If I were looking for a new car, I\\'d give serious consideration to the \\'08 Sonata\\'s 162 HP I4 and give it a test drive. I might still prefer the V6, but can\\'t imagine a large power difference from \\'05s 170 HP to \\'08s 162 HP. I think it was a good move on Hyundai\\'s part to offer 4 cyl in all trim levels, although I don\\'t like offering the SE trim in a 4 cyl \"only\" in manual trans. But, that was clearly a marketing decision. I also don\\'t like having to get a spoiler if wanting to upgrade from the base trim....that\\'s probably Hyundai\\'s way of pushing people to the top trim if they want something more than base trim in a 4 cyl.  It wasn\\'t too long ago that horsepower in the 190 HP range was considered good for a V6. Most notably that was the case for many GM mid-size V6 sedans from a generation ago. You don\\'t have to go that far back. Recall that the 2006 Camry\\'s V6 had \"only\" 192 horsepower. And the 2005 Optima and Sonata V6s had \"only\" 170 horses.  Ok! Lesson learned. You all have a lot more experience with I4\\'s and V6\\'s than I do.This Aura XR is my first ever V6 in 43 years of car ownership. I have only had 1 I-4 since my first car (56 Triumph roadster) an that was a 1986 2.5L Turbo charged, 255 HP Mitsubishi. Every thing else has been an American car company vehicle which had 8 or 10 cylinders.  Every thing else has been an American car company vehicle which had 8 or 10 cylinders.Now I understand. I\\'m glad they now have V6 engines that meet your power requirements, if barely. I would think I4 engines were diminutive too if I came from nothing less than V8 or V10 power.  I\\'m not familiar with 10 cyl cars, except the Viper.Did you have a Viper or some other 10 cyl car?  There are a few, but my V-10 was a Dodge RAM 2500 pick-up truck I forgot, my first wife had a Carola back about 75. It seldom made it out of Simi Valley, a very rural town of about 4000 people. Of course there are like 1 million people there now :mad:  Then this person can chat about how we want more exciting cars and driving experience.Amen. If I just had that passive entry key I could spend less time fumbling for my keys and more time enjoying that driving experience.  Good post Backy, I just dont get all this need for great power.My first car a V8 flathead Ford had about 40 less HP than my current I4.My 1952 Lincoln Capri had OV V8 had less this I4.My 52 Olds 98 Convertible,over 5000 lbs weight had less..how much power does one need unless you are a drag-racer? My Optima with the 2,4 engine is plenty fast enough off the line as well as passing.I am thankful that I didnt get the available V6.  Then I must conclude, you don\\'t like self service gas pumps (much less maintain at least a few things in your car yourself). :blush:  Yep. A refined I-4 can get the job done well in midsize sedans. I didn\\'t see the point in getting 200 HP Accord EXV6 over 150 HP Accord EX ten years ago, not only to save a few bucks (EXV6 was $1200 more, but LXV6 was $800 cheaper than EX/I-4), but thinking long term costs on something unnecessary.A decade later, I\\'m glad to have made that decision. And while I also drive an Acura TL, I just don\\'t see the need for the extra horses it has (almost 120 HP more to be exact). If I were to buy another Accord today, loaded EX-L will be it.  Looks like Accord and Malibu made the list.  it can be life and death sometimesI, for one, care quite a bit and as dictated by my short runup merges into 80mph traffic every day. My 268hp (and 240hp) V6 sedans are certainly safer in that respect. A fact often overlooked is that many of these midsize cars of today are every bit as big and heavy as those 200hp full size cars were 10 years ago. Do we have to have sub 7 second 0-60s, or 15 sec. quarters- maybe not- but if I can have it and still get overall FE in the mid 20s - WHY NOT - when a more challenged (and a whole lot less enjoyable) 4 banger is only going to get me an extra 2 or 3 mpg?  Then I must conclude, you don\\'t like self service gas pumps (much less maintain at least a few things in your car yourself).Nope, I actually do all of my own maintenance (thats how I could hold on to the \\'93 Accord so long; if I had to pay someone to replace the control arms, tie rods, shocks, sway bar bushings, front brakes, etc, I could never have kept that car). I pump my own gas so I can check the car\\'s fluids at each fill-up. I even wash the cars myself. To me, maintaining a vehicle is part of the experience, where as fumbling around for keys with my arms full on a rainy or snowy day is not.  Thats weird. For a guy who has trouble pressing a button to open the door, to do all that. Wouldn\\'t you get to drive more if you took it to a mechanic? Seriously though, when was the last time purists complained about lack of power windows in sports cars? I\\'m not throwing you out there, but true automotive enthusiasts find better things to complain about than a button on the key fob (or lack of).  I don\\'t know if having more power is safer or dangerous. I do think it can give a false sense of security at times, pretty much like those SUV drivers who think having 4WD makes them invincible on wet/snow/icy roads.There\\'s a great reason why most units of the best selling cars in America sell with four cylinder engines. Not only they offer refinement, but they offer good performance to go with it. Ask me, I drive one.  Thats weird. For a guy who has trouble pressing a button to open the door, to do all that.Do you know how passive entry works? Depending on implementation, it either unlocks the door as you walk up to it, or unlocks the door when you press a button on the door handle. It doesn\\'t open the door like Kit, and it doesn\\'t have the cool red LEDs on the front. It just saves you rifling through all your crap with your hands full to find your keys.It doesn\\'t drive for you, it doesn\\'t park for your, it doesn\\'t think for you, it just unlocks the doors. Its a feature, it doesn\\'t make or break the car, its a feature that I like. Most Nissans, Mazdas, and Toyotas can be equipped with it, its not rocket surgery.  I know, they equip because they sell. Its not rocket science. Its a toy that has recently arrived in the good ol\\' USA and people are going crazy about it. It has been available for years elsewhere.And I used them probably before you heard about it.   its not rocket surgery. I wonder if rocket surgeons go to med school or engineering school...   I wonder if rocket surgeons go to med school or engineering school... Sorry, my old professor says that all the time. He also says \"piece of bread\" instead of \"piece of cake.\"   I loved it, it made me laugh.If you\\'d rather, I can make like a tree and buzz off.   Could get subtler and say \"it\\'s not brain science\"...which does not even sound like a mixed metaphor.  I do think it can give a false sense of security at times, Right, and people who have huge Brembo brakes in their car have a false sense of security about being able to stop on a dime. Interesting how a positive can try to be turned into a negative.  How true must the auto enthusiast be to like convenience if it\\'s available. Plus we are talking about midsize cars here not sports cars. I personally love my key fob that locks/unlocks the doors and opens the trunk. Does that make me not an auto enthusiast? I\\'m not a fan of the auto key/start button yet as I think some bugs still need to be worked out before I\\'m trusting enough both from dependability and security aspects. I know my daughter who has a newborn and a 1.5 year old loves the fact that she can just walk up and open the car as her arms seem to always be full. Oops. I forgot. I\\'m not sure she\\'s an auto enthusiasts (although her and I do talk cars a lot) or not so she may not count.   It is one thing to like a feature and another to give it an importance like there is no tomorrow. If getting the key out is a pain in the rear, I can\\'t help but imagine how much pain turning the steering wheel etc might be, much less shifting manually, braking, accelerating... and still wanting to feel every bit of the road.Personally, I could do without added complexity and another thing to maintain. The fob battery dies, then what? You worry about going home in limp mode.  And we could do without your self-righteous diatribes about what you consider important or not important or what we should or shouldn\\'t buy.  Right. It\\'s all in the degree of want or need. I actually thought power windows were something I didn\\'t need or even want due to expense and possible costly repair. This was back in the late sixties and seventies. After moving to an area that has lots of toll roads and having to go through 4 of them on my commute for awhile, I came to appreciate power windows. Now I wouldn\\'t consider a midsize sedan without them. Hell, I don\\'t even know if you can get a midsize sedan without them anymore. So I guess there is a wide spectrum between \"I would like\" and \"absolutely can\\'t live without\".  Power windows may be considered a safety feature actually. It lets you operate with little fuss WHILE you were driving. Between pressing a button on the fob, or expecting the car to read you, I don\\'t see that urgency, or how it affects driving.In fact, a friend of mine bought an Altima. She lives in an area where carrying a can of mace is advised. A lot of attacks have happened when people get out of their car or are getting in. Couple of times she was driving, I noticed she had her key chain (with the mace can on it) safe and secure in her purse. When we got out the second time, I asked her whats the point of carrying the mace if it were in the purse? In the past, she would simply have the key in her hand and would be much more ready in case someone attacked her. This is a prime example of how things can make people less sensitive to surroundings.Giving a little more attention to what you\\'re doing, be it driving or walking to or from your car, can go a long way. Someone didn\\'t think about that, did they?  There\\'s a great reason why most units of the best selling cars in America sell with four cylinder enginesthat reason would be purchase price (as opposed to FE) I would guess. The Camry V6 gets a whole 1 mpg less than its 4 cylinder counterpart yet costs about $2600.00 more - all this in a vehicle category that a $2k price difference can make a big difference to a buyer. That $2600.00 is really what the great power of the V6 costs (net of a higher value at trade-in), the difference in FE only amounts to a few bucks per year. 15k miles/years = 600 gallons of gas at 25 mpg, 15k at 24 mpg = 625 gallons = $75 dollars more gas at $3.00/gal - PER YEAR. And I agree a Camry SE V6, for example, in the hands of your average 16 year old would not be my first choice either - all good things should be used in moderation....  Personally, I could do without added complexity and another thing to maintain. The fob battery dies, then what?That is why there is a full function metal key hidden in the credit card sized device. No need to limp home.  that reason would be purchase price (as opposed to FE) I would guess.Not necessarily. When I got my Accord EX-L, it was $800 more than LXV6 and $1200 less than EXV6 (which was within my budged). So, price wasn\\'t a factor, sensibility and features were. Automakers seem to be realizing it, as a result you can\\'t get an Accord LXV6 anymore. People are buying Accord EX-L/NAVI over EXV6 without NAV. BTW, Accord EX-L/I-4 is only $100 less than Accord EXV6. Do you think that would make a difference?And if price were the sole factor, base trims should handily outsell the more expensive ones. That is not the case with cars like Accord.  Seems to me, if you have to have one hand free to open the door anyway, you can use that same hand to pull the key out and push the button. More gadgetry than convenience, if you ask me. I still don\\'t see the big advantage.  Seems to me, if you have to have one hand free to open the door anyway, you can use that same hand to pull the key out and push the button. Pull the key out of what? Jeans pocket? Back pack? Purse? I guess if I was going to devote a hand to carrying my keys my entire life it wouldn\\'t be such an issue.More gadgetry than convenience, if you ask me. I still don\\'t see the big advantage.Yup, just like they said about microwaves before everyone got one.  Not necessarily. When I got my Accord EX-L, it was $800 more than LXV6 and $1200 less than EXV6 (which was within my budged). So, price wasn\\'t a factor, sensibility and features were. Automakers seem to be realizing it, as a result you can\\'t get an Accord LXV6 anymore. People are buying Accord EX-L/NAVI over EXV6 without NAV. BTW, Accord EX-L/I-4 is only $100 less than Accord EXV6. Do you think that would make a difference?Alas, my Accord EX I4/5M sedan was wayyyy cheaper than the V6/6M combo. I have no interest in something that shifts gears for me (unlock doors, yes, shift, no). I would be much more inclined to go with a V6 with a manual than a 4cyl with Nav. I don\\'t travel out of my area enough with that car to warrant a nav system. Mapquest and Google maps have been fine so far.  I think I can manage to pull the key out of my pocket and push the button with the same hand I will use to open the door. Is that too difficult for you? Small hands? uncoordinated?  A question. When you walk up to the car, will it unlock the driver\\'s door only, or will it unlock all doors? If I am walking up to the car with stuff in my hands, I will usually put the stuff in the back seat, or the trunk, which I can do with my remote key.  When I got my Accord EX-L, it was $800 more than LXV6 and $1200 less than EXV6 (which was within my budged). So, price wasn\\'t a factor, sensibility and features were.Isn\\'t that just another way of saying value (according to your wants) for the dollar spent?  I think I can manage to pull the key out of my pocket and push the button with the same hand I will use to open the door. Is that too difficult for you? Small hands? uncoordinated?Pretty much. With the infant carrier in one hand and the groceries in the other, its nice not to have to try to pull the keys out of my jeans pocket. Most of the coordination stuff got corrected with physical therapy already, thats why I can drive a manual trans.  guess. The Camry V6 gets a whole 1 mpg less than its 4 cylinder counterpart yet costs about $2600.00 more - all this in a vehicle category that a $2k price difference can make a big difference to a buyer. That $2600.00 is really what the great power of the V6 costs (net of a higher value at trade-in), the difference in FE only amounts to a few bucks per year. 15k miles/years = 600 gallons of gas at 25 mpg, 15k at 24 mpg = 625 gallons = $75 dollars more gas at $3.00/gal - PER YEAR. For what it is worth, www.Fueleconomy.gov has combined fuel economy on the V6 Camry at 22 MPG, with the 4-cylinder having 25 MPG combined.  It is. The want being features, not more power. I just don\\'t see the point. And as gas prices go up, a larger chunk of the market would too.  That is the point many of us Hyundai owners have been trying to make people understand; value for the dollar.The Sonata now offers the 4 cyl in all trim levels. If I had to buy now, I\\'d take a serious look at the Sonata Limited 4 cyl (it\\'s only 8 HP less than my \\'05, 6 cyl). Anytime from 11/1 to 11/30/07 I could buy a Sonata Limited (with the optional floor mats) for $17,878 + $189 doc fee + ttl. That, to me is value for the dollar. The features and reliability are awesome. So far, my small business\\' Sonatas (there\\'s only 2 of us), 2.5 year old \\'05 and 9 month old \\'07 have been flawless. Enjoy your Honda. It may be the best value for what you want.  I remember earlier in the year looking at the leaked redesigned pics of the 2008 Mazda6 and saying damn thats a nice car. I was all for buying one when it came out.... but then the hoopla died down, and a carryover from 07 was put out. What was that about? That was one of the few new cars I was looking forward to since the dissapointing Camry. I don\\'t like the new design of the Accord, except in the coupe version. The 08 Malibu shows a promise.... but I hope they put that \"redesigned\" Mazda6 out in 09. Not that i\\'d buy one.... but it\\'d be a nice addition to see on the road. Cuz I get way too much pleasure outta zoom zooming buy the boring looking Mazda6\\'s out there now in my lowley Platinum ed. Sonata.Oh... here\\'s the link for the news and pics of the \"new\" Mazda6.http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/06/2008-mazda6-breaks-early/   Yeah but what good is an extra 3 MPG if you can\\'t merge onto the freeway at 80 MPH and dangerously pass everyone on the right?  Should see more exact plans at the Detroit Auto Show in January and the there are rumours that we should see the 09 Mazda6 in the second quarter of 08. I do emphasize rumors by the way! Anywho, reviews on the the new Mazda6 have started to hit european car mags and it suggests that the car is a bit more nimble due to weight loss, while increasing size and comfort. NVH have been reduced as well so for some this may be good (though I am perfectly happy with the current model\\'s NVH). It still is not clear whether the hatchback or wagon version (both of which look great in the next generation Mazda6 imo, and I don\\'t often, if ever, say that about wagons). I have the current Mazda6 hatchback and find it extremely useful for things like trips to IKEA, Home Depot, or business trips. So I hope Mazda doesn\\'t give away one of it\\'s huge advantages in the current market and not bring the next generation hatchback to North America. and as to boring and generic... while beauty is a personal judgement, I can\\'t say many would say the sonata\\'s exterior is anything but unoffensive.   If people can merge onto the freeway in a Yaris, a Fit, or heck, my 12 year old 130hp Accord, you can do so safely in a Camry 4-cylinder too. (I say this just in case you weren\\'t being sarcastic).The Camry 4-cylinder is more lethargic than the current Honda 4-cylinder, but it\\'s still better than many larger engines from 10 or 15 years ago, when the interstate speeds were still 70-85MPH.  Yeah but what good is an extra 3 MPG if you can\\'t merge onto the freeway at 80 MPH and dangerously pass everyone on the right? If people can merge onto the freeway in a Yaris, a Fit, or heck, my 12 year old 130hp Accord, you can do so safely in a Camry 4-cylinder too. (I say this just in case you weren\\'t being sarcastic).  Yes, that last post of mine was complete sarcasm. Nobody needs to be going faster than 65 when merging onto the freeway. Passing on the right is dangerous --- unfortunately, many people just don\\'t understand that.  The pictures of the redesigned Mazda6 were of the European version that is out for the 2008 model year. The U.S. version should arrive next year as an 09 model but will likely have different sheetmetal.  perhaps the Mazda6 is suffering from a case of Ford-itis - things that are promised scheduled or otherwise publicized then magically happen late - or not at all.  ummmm...what are you talking about? what date on the mazda6 has been delayed... I can understand people are impatient about the new mazda6 coming out b/c press reports have been very positive and the responses on sites like this and on autoblog were resoundingly enthusiastic, but there have not been dates released by Mazda that have not been met regarding the Mazda6 (mostly because mazda has released very few dates or details for the North American launch). Once again your efforts to sling mud are defeated by lacking one important element...facts.  More gadgetry than convenience, if you ask me. I still don\\'t see the big advantage. I originally agreed with you, however, after using them quite frequently, I find them really convenient  The U.S. version should arrive next year as an 09 model but will likely have different sheetmetal. That is not true. My contacts at Mazda have stated that only minor differences will be present. Interior and exterior will remain mostly identical.  That\\'s good to hear. The Euro version is nice.  I agree. I think it is fine the way it is over there.  see post #7561 - our resident FoMoCo expert - for some reason when we end up talking about rumors and changes that just don\\'t happen (or happen late) , that would be Ford-itis. Exactly how long do you suppose that we\\'ve be seeing posts about the \\'rumored\\' arrival of real engines for the Fusion? How long has the Fusion been available - that\\'s how long. At first the Fusion was going to get the 3.5 (for sure, for sure) and later that changes to some sort of \\'improved\\' 3.0 and to this day I\\'m not sure that anybody really knows. This has been going on for 3 years now. Just in time for Ford to rename the car a \\'Falcon\\', I guess, and hope it sells better - oops - they\\'ve already done something like that and yet another unfounded rumor... It seems that whenever we all get involved in discussions of what\\'s on the horizon, Ford/Mazda are in the middle of that conjecture, and it does get old - promises, promises - Ford-itis. - and it is a shame that a good company like Toyo Koygo should be so infected   if the implication is that you must drive in some sort of unsafe manner and/or that in real traffic situations you don\\'t have to do things like merge onto a highway off a short entry ramp - dream on. These things can (and do) happen every day - to all of us - at varying frequencies. I\\'ll keep my extra 100 hp (or so) , and pay the 3 mpg (or so) .  These things can (and do) happen every day - to all of usSure do, but implying (not saying you have) that people with the 4-cyl equivalents of these V6 vehicles are incapable of taking care of these situations is ludicrous. Is the V6 faster? Sure, but it doesn\\'t render the 4-cyl useless. If it did, 4-cyl midsize sedans wouldn\\'t outsell V6 equivalents by such large margins.I think some people buy a V6 because they don\\'t want to rev past 3,000RPM ever. Personally, I see no problem with using an engine to the fullest, although I didn\\'t pass 3,500RPM today in my 130hp Accord today on my way to school. And that includes commuting in 60-75MPH interstate traffic between 8 and 9AM.  Where has Mazda promised anything for the U.S. Mazda6 that they haven\\'t delivered? I don\\'t recall anything being announced or rumored. They released pictures of the 2008 European model and some of us got confused and thought it was the U.S. model. Period. Stop inventing things that don\\'t exist.  In reality, you will always keep those extra horses and pay extra on fuel costs. I know, I do, when driving my TL. It has about 120 more horses than my Accord. Do I need them? Nope. And my Accord isn\\'t a light weight car either. In fact, it was one of the heaviest cars in its class, and at ~3200 lb would still rank up there while having \"only\" 150 HP.Short ramp acceleration excuses are unwarranted if the four cylinder is a capable design to begin with. Most four cylinder engines aren\\'t however (but then, not all V6s are equal either).  see post #7561 - our resident FoMoCo expert - for some reason when we end up talking about rumors and changes that just don\\'t happen (or happen late) , that would be Ford-itisI assume you are talking about me. I am not a FoMoCo expert. I have knowledge pertaining to Mazda. There has never been a launch date for the North American Mazda6. All we heard, this going back about a year, is that a new Mazda6 will debut in 2008. Does this mean MY 2008? or actually be available in 2008? Who knows. That is not Ford-itis. Why commit to something and then not come through. That would be a mistake. So far, I have not seen evidence that something has not been fulfilled from Mazda.It seems that whenever we all get involved in discussions of what\\'s on the horizon, Ford/Mazda are in the middle of that conjecture, and it does get old - promises, promises - Ford-itis. - and it is a shame that a good company like Toyo Koygo should be so infected What promises from the manufacturer have not been fulfilled? I am not talking about rumors from magazines or anything like that. I am talking about words directly from the manufacturers. So far, Mazda has done what they said they were going to do. The have a new Mazda6 out, just not here. I have never heard of a specific launch date, time, or what MY it would be. I only heard \"2008\" as part of the rumor from my sources at Mazda. Nothing attached to launch date has ever been verified.A blunder attached to the Mazda6 would be the launch date of the 2006 Mazdaspeed6. It was promised to be out in early 2005, and we got in in December 2005.  I think some people buy a V6 because they don\\'t want to rev past 3,000RPM ever.I think most people who buy a V6 do so because they don\\'t want to rev past 3,000RPM ever. I imagine they don\\'t even go above that on the test drive and this is why they feel the V6 is needed. My favorite is when these people pull out in front of me and still will not step on the gas...no, they\\'d rather do their pokey 2500 rpm acceleration and force me to step on my brakes.  don\\'t know about that - have 2 cars (both V6 and very quick by almost any standard) and I get the engines wound up to maybe 5 grand or so - almost every time I\\'m on that short hwy entrance ramp and need to be able to get from 30 to about 80 in a hurry.  My wife has a 300 hp Aviator. She\\'s never gone beyond 50% throttle - EVER. When I do it she starts screaming about the gas gauge or thinks we\\'re about to wreck. The AVERAGE driver is scared of their vehicle and scared of acceleration.  I\\'d bet you are the exception rather than the rule, however. I applaud you for it though. You USE the engine you bought, so you aren\\'t constantly driving around with an extra liter of displacement under the hood. Personally, for the few times I need to really move, my \\'06 4-cyl pleases ME in how quickly it takes off (as far as 4-cylinder\\'s go, the 2.4L in my 2006 Accord is darn quick relatively). I drive from the suburbs to downtown Birmingham, drive to work through city streets (over a small mountain) and back to school at night, before driving back home. I filled up my car yesterday - 13.7 gallons on 411.2 miles. That\\'s 30.01 MPG in a midsize car that is as fast as I\\'ve ever needed or wanted, and is only 1 MPG shy of the highway rating in my much slower 1996 Accord, which averages between 26 and 27 MPG in the same commute. I am MORE than pleased. I\\'m glad you are too, cap\\'n.:)  I remember when I bought a \"typical\" economy car back in October 1970, a 60HP (yes, that\\'s right 60 screaming horses!) front-wheel drive car - a Simca 1204. I got along just fine on compact and short freeway entrance ramps, as I actually accelerated through the entire entrance ramp, and entered the freeway at close to the prevailing speed. On the other hand, large Detroit iron with multiple times the HP of the Simca would lag behind or putter along on the entrance ramp - until they reached the freeway, and then it was pedal to the metal.In many cases, the driver, and the driver\\'s technique and skill along with the car\\'s handling, is more important than raw HP.  Well I did say \"most\" not \"all\"...besides don\\'t you need to get over 6000 rpm to hit max HP  .BTW, the not wanting high rpms is not limited to V6 drivers, as was stated most are deathly afrain of high rpms. I get my 4 cylinder to redline from time to time, when I want maximum acceleration...but I am quite sure most do not ever come close.  I\\'m not saying people shouldn\\'t buy V6\\'s. I was just complaining about how irresponsibly most people drive when they have some power under the hood. Interestingly, mostly of these jack*** drivers will be in mid-size $25K to $40K cars. You\\'ll notice most people driving expensive 300 to 400 HP German cars drive safely and courteously. Guess they feel they have nothing to prove.I\\'ll be shopping for a car in the next few months and will probably get a V6. Personally, I\\'m happy as long as my avg fuel economy is above 20 MPG, and having the extra power for hills and passing definitely gives peace of mind. The smooth and quiet power delivery is nice too, although some newer 4cyls are very smooth/quiet as well.  The smooth and quiet power delivery is nice too, although some newer 4cyls are very smooth/quiet as well. Yes they are. I\\'d put my 2.4L 4-cyl in my Accord (2006) up against the 3.5L V6 in the Aura/G6/Impala or the 3800 in the Lucerne when comparing smoothness and bet the Accord would win. Mine sounds smoother and more turbine-like than the coarse pushrods from GM, despite having only 4, large bore cylinders to the 6 of the GM V6.  the not wanting high rpms is not limited to V6 drivers, as was stated most are deathly afrain of high rpmswell, maybe so, but some of these engines, the 2GR Toyota and about any of Honda\\'s 4 bangers can and do sound and feel good at those high rpms. Perhaps it is those engines that feel like \\'somethin\\' is gonna blow\\' that perpetuate this adversion that you are talking about?  Yep. 99% of my driving involves sub-3000 driving (unless I\\'m cruising at 80 mph, which I do for most part :P). Entering freeways or high speed passing will always see hitting redline, which is a lowly 6300 rpm in my 98 Accord. But it is fun while it lasts (and that isn\\'t for very long). I\\'ve estimated that car to go from a rolling 40 to 85 mph in 9-10 seconds.  reminds me of my 1970 Buick Opel Kadett - 1100 cc\\'s and also about 60 hp. Didn\\'t feel it was dangerous or anything at the time (at that age I was just happy to have wheels), also 60hp and remember really having to row thru the gearbox to get anything out of it, FE if I remember right was unremarkable (in the 20s). My how far we\\'ve come - because now my Altima 3.5 will return better FE than that Opel AND blow the doors off of many of those \\'muscle\\' cars of that time at better than double the FE...  would submit that 99% of everybody\\'s driving is below 3000 rpm - even those who have the 4 bangers. 70mph on these V6s is usually closer to 2000rpm, and the 4s a few hundred higher. Only on harder acceleration are any of us ever going to see anything above even 5 grand, and as you say, it doesn\\'t last long when you do.  \"I\\'ll be shopping for a car in the next few months and will probably get a V6. Personally, I\\'m happy as long as my avg fuel economy is above 20 MPG, and having the extra power for hills and passing definitely gives peace of mind. The smooth and quiet power delivery is nice too, although some newer 4cyls are very smooth/quiet as well. \"I agree with autoritiker\\'s comments. Also, I live next to a busy street, and cars are always accelerating from the S curve when they pass by my driveway. When a 4cylinder Accord passes, you can definitely hear the engine winning. When a 6cylinder Accord passes, you hear nothing. I like that. The V6 engine makes the Accord feel and sound more luxurious, and more like a high-end car. While I definitely like (and use) the passing/merging power, there are other reasons that the V6 appeals to me.  My Aura XR is turning 1800 RPM at 70 MPH 2000 at 80 MPH and I am getting 30 MPG (910 miles on 30.08 Gal.) at 80 MPH. It sees the 7000 RPM red line every once in a while too.Hypothetically speaking, we are cruising at 80 MPH down I-5 through the central valley of California, side by side, my engine is turning 2000 RPM, What does your Honda\\'s Tach. indicate?We come to the Grapevine and I drop to 5th and continue at 80 MPH up that 15 degree hill turning about 2700 RPM. What gear are you in, and are you still beside me going 80 MPH?  Here\\'s some excerpts from a review from a European newspaper, the not very famous (in America) Belfast Telegraph. The revamped Mazda 6 is a real revelation: lighter and more agile, yet supple and serene.So here I am on a road I know well, in the hills and mountains just north of Nice. It\\'s the kind of road that proves there\\'s still enjoyment to be had from driving, and &#150; if the car\\'s not worthy of it &#150; frustration can set in. It doesn\\'t have to be some mega-money supercar, compromise-free sports car or honed hatchback for everything to gel; it simply has to be designed and engineered to work with the driver\\'s commands and instincts, to involve the driver in the whole dynamic process.This new Mazda 6 does exactly that, to a wholly remarkable degree. It feels like an Alfa 159 should, or like a BMW 3 series would if it were, like the Mazda, front-wheel drive. It has the precision, fluidity, light-footedness and sixth-sense responsiveness that used to mark out the Peugeot 405 nearly two decades ago. Mazda has been annoying us for several years with the puerile \"zoom-zoom\" slogan, but the reality really matches the hype.  All this driver-pleasing responsiveness would soon turn sour if the Mazda made a meal of poor road surfaces, but it proves supple and serene over bumps and waves. Quiet, too, with little roar from the road and engines &#150; all three versions sampled &#150; which are smooth, almost inaudible at idle and restrained when revved.It\\'s clear, then, that huge thought has gone into how this car feels to drive. There\\'s a Mazda philosophy here that is close to the one Peugeot used to follow. It says that a car\\'s nose should be keen to turn and in doing so must load up the outside rear wheel, making the car feel \"pointy\". If you then ease the accelerator, the car\\'s cornering line should tighten, but in a controlled, progressive way.This makes for great economy of effort on the part of the driver with great reward, because the driver is using the accelerator as much as the steering to guide the car. It makes a good Mazda feel vital, but never scary. And should the tail want to break free of grip when you brake hard on a tightening corner, there\\'s the standard-fit ESP to rein it in. The brakes, too, have a natural, progressive response, and the gearshift has precise, satisfying movements.  All three versions are designed to look Japanese, celebrating their origin instead of trying to hide it behind a cloak of Europeanism. There are references to swords, mist-shrouded mountains and attention to tiny details, all of which has the scent of baloney. It\\'s a good-looking car, though, with a strong Mazda personality thanks to its bulging front wings and trademark front grille.There are some good details here. The horseshoe-shaped wind deflectors ahead of the front wheels are a simple aid to the Mazda 6\\'s excellent aerodynamics (it has a drag coefficient of 0.27). Inside, there\\'s a feeling of soft-touch quality that would befit a premium car.Gadgetry abounds. At night, a wave of light passes through the controls on the centre console on start-up, simulating a heartbeat, and some versions play (annoyingly) the three \"zoom-zoom-zoom\" notes on switch-off. The cross-functional network controls on the steering wheel handle all sorts of functions, including trip computer, stereo, sat-nav and air-conditioning, and Mazda claims a young person can master them in minutes. Older people, it concedes, might need up to a day.Those more senior souls will also hate the small odometer display, the difficulty of reading it made worse by the orangey-red used for all the digital read-outs. As Mazda expects most buyers to be over 50, that\\'s a problem. \"I can\\'t read it, either,\" says Hajime Matsumura, project leader for the Mazda 6, with surprising frankness. But that\\'s the only significant fault with his car, which otherwise might just be the new class leader. Surprised? So am I.   forgot a picture...(again this is the Euro Mazda6, which may or may not look like the one we\\'ll see here)  would submit that 99% of everybody\\'s driving is below 3000 rpm - even those who have the 4 bangers. 70mph on these V6s is usually closer to 2000rpm, and the 4s a few hundred higher. Only on harder acceleration are any of us ever going to see anything above even 5 grand, and as you say, it doesn\\'t last long when you do.I typically stay under 3k on my daily commute but I have been getting in the mid-30s in my mixed hwy/city driving. I do like to leave it in 3rd from time to time getting on the freeway. The 2.2 in the old Accord and the 2.4 in the new one both seem to do a fine job. While I can\\'t say I am pleased as punch with my \\'07, its FE and power have never been on my complaint list.  Great find, zzzoom6.It has the precision, fluidity, light-footedness and sixth-sense responsiveness that used to mark out the Peugeot 405 nearly two decades ago.Ahh, my father owned one of those 405s back when Peugeot was still in the states. It was a fun-to-drive car, and handled better than some \"sports\" cars of the day. If only it wasn\\'t in the shop all the time (as most 405s were).It\\'s clear, then, that huge thought has gone into how this car feels to drive.Too bad this feeling will be lost to MOST midsize sedan buyers.Inside, there\\'s a feeling of soft-touch quality that would befit a premium car. I just hope this also translates to the cars we receive stateside as well.Those more senior souls will also hate the small odometer display, the difficulty of reading it made worse by the orangey-red used for all the digital read-outs. As Mazda expects most buyers to be over 50, that\\'s a problem. \"I can\\'t read it, either,\" says Hajime Matsumura, project leader for the Mazda 6, with surprising frankness.First of all, I\\'m guessing that most buyers in the US will be below the age of 50, not above. Secondly, I prefer the orange-red display at night, since it\\'s easier on my eyes than the horrendous green that I used to deal with. I guess we\\'ll see how \"difficult\" it really is to read when the examples hit the showrooms.But that\\'s the only significant fault with his car, which otherwise might just be the new class leader. Surprised? So am I.I\\'m not... :P  Well, in my 2003 Accord V6 I recall I\\'d be at about 2500 RPM at 80 MPH in top gear (5th gear in Auto). If hypothetically speaking, no one got in my way and I was able to maintain 80 MPH all the way up the grapevine, I don\\'t believe a downshift would have been necessary; just a little extra press on the gas is all. The Aura XR seems to have excellent choices for 5th and 6th gear ratios..... Do you find most of the gears to be about 700 RPM apart at the same speed?  My 1998 Accord turns about 3000 rpm at 80 mph (2300 rpm at 60 mph). Interestingly enough, a 2007 Civic I drove recently turned 2500 rpm (and we recorded 39.2 mpg at the end of 309 miles in a little more than 4 hours of driving (average driving speed was 75-76 mph).  If hypothetically speaking, no one got in my way and I was able to maintain 80 MPH all the way up the grapevine, I don\\'t believe a downshift would have been necessary; just a little extra press on the gas is all. Not many cars have the torque to pull an overdrive gear up the grapevine. Even normal high gear is a struggle for many if they are not at or near the torque peak when they hit the bottom of the grade.I think 6th is about 7-800 RPM below 5th (high gear). 3-4 are pretty close together, about 600 RPM but the rest are closer to 1000 RPMAnyone with a Honda I-4 want to divulge there RPM\\'s at 70/80 MPH?  Anyone with a Honda I-4 want to divulge there RPM\\'s at 70/80 MPH? It\\'s really simple. In 5th in my Automatic 06 2.4L Accord, the engine turns 1000 RPM per 30 MPH. So, 2,333 at 70, 2,667 at 80. I\\'d wager that gearing is very similar on the 2008s, if not identical. Hope this helps.  In top gear, virtually no car would be anywhere close to its peak torque at 80 mph (unless it were a diesel). In Aura XR, you couldn\\'t get to peak torque rpm in sixth gear. You will hit 115 mph speed governor before that happens.Regardless of the torque from the engine, cars are generally geared to max out the thrust around 0.10g. This is often insufficient, so a lower gear is necessitated.Interestingly enough, 2008 Accord V6 is geared almost as short as 2008 Accord I-4 (runs about 2050 rpm at 60 mph). So, going uphill, its torque multiplication will be almost identical to competing V6 sedans that require at least one shift. So, its effectiveness in top gear will be close to Aura XR in fifth. And both may require to be in fourth (one shift for Accord, two for Aura) to make for a quick climb up a hill.  Yup - my I4 08 AT - does about 2700rpm at 80mph.  Why is the transmission (or driver) down shifitng a problem. Why would I care if my car needs to be in 3rd or 4th or 5th gear for some particular hill? :confuse:   In 5th in my Automatic 06 2.4L Accord, the engine turns 1000 RPM per 30 MPH. So, 2,333 at 70, 2,667 at 80. This is where my Mazda6 suffers. At 70 mph, I am spinning 3,000rpm\\'s and at 80 mph, I am spinning 3,400 rpm\\'s. Bad for fuel economy, great for passing / performance.  Surprisingly, right now, KBB and Edmunds agree pretty closely on the value of my car. Private party value for average to outstanding is $14091 to $16,122 on edmunds and on KBB it is $13.920 to $16,195 for fair to good condition.  This is where my Mazda6 suffers. At 70 mph, I am spinning 3,000rpm\\'s and at 80 mph, I am spinning 3,400 rpm\\'s. Not sure what year or transmission you have. I know the automatic in the 4 cyl changed a lot as of 2006.My 2007 I4, auto is at about 2250 @ 60. This should mean ~2600 at 70 and about 3000 at 80.  I have a 5-speed manual  Anyone with a Honda I-4 want to divulge there RPM\\'s at 70/80 MPH? 08 LX 5spd manual, less then 600 miles on the odo. 70 mph = 2500 RPM\\'s. My last car, a 5 spd V6 Mazda6 Wagon (05) turned 2950 RPMs at the same speed. While it\\'s certainly not slow at highway speed, you don\\'t get that push in the back when you dip the pedal in 5th like with a V6. Then again a nice rev-matched downshift to 4th with the Honda is a thing of beauty. I don\\'t miss the V6 in may daily commute. It was fun to have the power but the MPG was just awful and the Honda i-4 is tons smoother then the Duratec based Mazda V6 was. First tank of gas in my new Accord was a shade over 25mpg, hoping for closer to 30 with my regular, relaxed highway commute and some break in. The Mazda delivered a steady 23mpg in combined driving over a 2 year period.I really don\\'t have a lot bad to say about the Mazda6. It was good car, no real problems. I found it a bit small inside but I\\'m a wide load so that\\'s not the car\\'s fault. Biggest pain was that we don\\'t have a local dealer. This was our 3rd Mazda.The width and interior size of the Accord is fantastic for a big guy like me. We totaled the Mazda when my wife rear ended a Jeep Liberty or we\\'d still be driving it waiting for the Diesel Accord to come out. Now we\\'ll drive and enjoy our LX for a few years and see how the diesel introductions go.  On the other end of the chart, my Viper would chug along at around 1,500 rpm in 6th gear at 70 mph. It still has plenty of torque at that setting and not bad on gas mileage there either.However, cruising at 70 mph is not what the Viper experience is all about. If I wanted to do that I\\'d take the Sebring.   Ahhh yes . . . . if we all just had 500+ horses under the hood, gearing likley wouldn\\'t be as much of an issue :P  2007 Accord LX 5-speed manual Peak torque of 160 @ 4000 RPMFrom my experience, in 5th gear 10 MPH ~ 400 RPM40 MPH ~ 1600 RPM50 MPH ~ 2000 RPM60 MPH ~ 2400 RPM70 MPH ~ 2800 RPM80 MPH ~ 3200 RPM90 MPH ~ 3600 RPM100 MPH ~ 4000 RPMNever had it much higher, I suppose it tops out drag limited at around 120-130 MPH, spinning 4800-5200 RPM (peak HP is 166 @ 5800)Fuel economy average to date is about 28 mpg (city) and 34 mpg (hwy)  Viper is geared that tall not because it has torque, but because its fuel economy would suck if it were geared shorter. And its fuel economy isn&#146;t anything to be proud of anyway. It is not uncommon to see Viper returning 10-12 mpg in road/comparison tests. That&#146;s the bonus one gets with 500 HP.Now, if one never uses those horses, mileage will be higher. And it applies as much to those performance cars as it does to mainstream midsizers.BTW, my experience with Sebring has been horrible when it came to fuel economy.  Sounds right. Calculated number for 2008 Accord (60/70/80 mph)I-4/AT: 1950/2300/2600V6/AT: 2050/2400/2750I-4/MT: 2200/2600/2950V6/MT: 2100/2450/2800Interesting thing to note is that Accord V6/Auto is geared shorter than I-4/Auto.  Forgot to add how smooth and quiet it is at 3500 RPM.Several times, I\\'ve merged onto a highway and been trying to navigate traffic and/or follow road signs at 70-80mph, and only noticed that I forgot to shift into 5th after a couple of miles.My stepfather, who has a 2003 Accord EX I-4 Auto, drove my manual transmission Accord to pick my wife and I up from the airport. He never shifted into fifth the whole time out on the highway, like 10 miles. I could see the engine was running 3500 in 4th, but I said nothing and neither he nor my wife noticed.  Thats typical of Honda engines.  WHY? That makes no sense to me :confuse: I would think the smaller engine would require the shorter gears at the top end? Any theories?  Yes. Shorter gearing allows VCM to engage more often. The VCM-equipped Odyssey has shorter gearing than non-VCM Odys yet get better mileage because the VCM can operate more often. I\\'m in a hurry, but am sure someone here will explain it in more detail than I can at this (limited) time. I\\'ll check in later!TheGrad  Viper is geared that tall not because it has torque, but because its fuel economy would suck if it were geared shorter.With 500 lb-ft of torque it still has plenty, even at 1,500 rpms. I agree that the gearing is more meant to make the EPA happy and that\\'s why a lot of owners put in aftermarket geaing.I think my Monroney label (window sticker) rates it at 11/22. Those numbers are fairly close to what I\\'ve experienced, depending on what type of driving I\\'m doing.  Maybe, it\\'s as simple as Honda wants the V6 to feel that much sportier, thus the lower gearing. I\\'m sure that\\'s why manual transmissions are geared lower.  Congrats on your new ride! Seems as though it suits you well... and the manual tranny in the Accord is pretty awesome. Looking forward to your thoughts on the Honda...I think you\\'re the only one on here w/ an 08. And since you had a similar car as I currently have, I\\'ll be able to relate a bit more to your descriptions. Glad to have another poster here too!  robertsmx, I\\'ve got to laugh.Who with half a brain would buy a Viper if they were concerned with the MPG of the car? The Viper is already hit with the gas-guzzler tax. The Viper is about raw power, not MPG, interior room or cargo room. It\\'s not meant to be a \"practical car\". It\\'s in a specialty niche for those who can afford it in additon to their \"normal\" car.  2007 Accord LX 5-speed manual 40 MPH ~ 1600 RPM50 MPH ~ 2000 RPM60 MPH ~ 2400 RPM70 MPH ~ 2800 RPM80 MPH ~ 3200 RPM90 MPH ~ 3600 RPM100 MPH ~ 4000 RPMCalculated number for 2008 AccordI-4/AT: 60=1950,  70=2300  80=2600V6/AT: 60=2050 70=2400 80=2750I-4/MT: 60=2200 70=2600 80=2950V6/MT: 60=2100 70=2450 80=2800Saturn Aura XR 6 sp Automatic 60=1500 70=1750 80=2000So at 70 MPH my Aura XR is spinning 1050 RPM less than the \\'07 Accord I4MT 650 RPM less than the 08 Accord V6AT 700 RPM less than the 08 Accord V6MTInteresting, Thats 39000 Rev\\'s per hour the XR saves compared to the Accord V6AT.That could be over 500,000 Rev\\'s per 1000 miles. or 7.6 million rev\\'s per year(15k miles per year), That could mean a couple years more life for the Saturn engine. That would be true if the engines were made of the same materials and maintenance was the same, and all the driving was done at 70 MPH, etc. etc. etc.Just food for thought :blush:  Interesting and I\\'m sure someone will correct me if I\\'m wrong. I haven\\'t had a MT since 1983 but, as I recall, in a MT, X revs equaled Y MPH in each gear. In hilly CT, an AT can have different revs,in the same gear, at Y MPH depending upon whether the road is down hill, up hill or relatively flat. This would be due to the direct connection vs the fluid connection, I think. If I\\'m wrong please correct and explain.  Ever heard the term \"Lock up Torque Converter\"?It essentially makes a mechanical connection through the torque converter once a pre-programmed speed has been reached. Used to be, in the old days this didn\\'t exist, then in the late 70\\'s, I think, they figured a way to engage a latch of some sort which locked the two halves of the torque converter together once top gear was engaged and something like manifold vacuum was high.Today it\\'s the transmissions computer that determines when to lock up occurs and it might even lock up in other than top gear.  So at 70 MPH my Aura XR is spinning 1050 RPM less than the \\'07 Accord I4MT  650 RPM less than the 08 Accord V6AT  700 RPM less than the 08 Accord V6MT Interesting, Thats 39000 Rev\\'s per hour the XR saves compared to the Accord V6AT.

That would be true if the engines were made of the same materials and maintenance was the same, and all the driving was done at 70 MPH, etc. etc. etc. Just food for thought That is one big IF. Not applicable, in the \"real world\".  It seems to me if there were a person who was thinking about buying a midsize sedan, they may want to simplify the choices from the many listed above to just a few. The way to do this would be to look at different ways to divide the category... here are some thoughts:Budget/ Value - Sonata (18k for a v-6?, i4 ?), Mazda6 (17k for a v-6 in pdx), OptimaReliability - Sonata, Accord, Legacy, Fusion (listed in no particular order...) - of course I have to add that the differences in reliability as reported by JD Powers and Consumer Reports over a 5 year period between the most reliable and below average vehicles in this class are separated by only a few percent over that five year period... in other words, I would suggest that most vehicles in this class are very reliable.Sportiness/ fun to drive - Altima, Legacy GT, Mazda6, Aura, Accord coupe (reviews suggest the 2 door as having a much more sporty suspension than the 4 dr), Camry SE (motortrend said this model was more sporty than the Accord...for what that\\'s worth)Cargo Utility - Outback, Passat wagon, Mazda6 hatchback/ wagonResale value - Accord, CamryInterior Quality - too subjective, but my faves are the Legacy, new Sonata, Accord, AuraGas mileage - ? not really a stat that I\\'ve looked at too much, but I\\'m sure others here will knowSafety - LegacyRide Comfort - not too sure where to start with this since some would value a tomb like ride, others might like something with more connection. Also, one person may like a seat that another would find awful. But I think the people who would list this as one of their primary considerations would most likely prefer something that is smooth and quiet and not very engaging. Camry, Accord, Sonata. I\\'m sure my list is far from comprehensive, but I welcome comments and additions/ clarifications to this list. Of course many of these qualities are somewhat subjective, but if there are new readers of this forum, our comments may help make their choices easier if not get them to think about how to go about making their choice.  Sportiness/ fun to drive - Altima, Legacy GT, Mazda6, Aura, Accord coupe (reviews suggest the 2 door as having a much more sporty suspension than the 4 dr), Camry SE (motortrend said this model was more sporty than the Accord...for what that\\'s worth) Hmm a full-size \"personal coupe\" as fun to drive...eh kind of screams Monte Carlo to me. Not that the Prelude was svelte either, but that is a large automobile. I think our base Legacy has a pretty active ride which is understandably too harsh for some, but it is fun for me to drive. My friend had a previous generation Camry SE and it was reasonably firm as well, and was a 4 cyl 5 spd combo with a \"sport\" suspension.  In my opinion, the number of revolutions an engine has accumulated is less important in terms of overall durability than the design of the engine and most importantly, proper maintenance (especially when the difference between the average RPM is something like 2200 versus 3200, when redline is over 6000). Of course, any engine can be adversely affected by operating outside it\\'s design parameters.Honda engines are designed to rev. Look at Civic Si, S2000... even one of the new Accord I4 variants has a redline over 7000 RPM. And then there are Honda sport motorcycles...Think about the engines in your lawn mower, leaf blower, or a personal watercraft or outboard boat motor (all of which are also made by Honda). Those engines stay at very high RPM during most of their use and are not adversely affected because they are designed to operate in those conditions.Most Honda motors have always been this way, and it hasn\\'t seemed to adversely affect their durability compared to larger displacement, lower-revving motors in the past. In short, I don\\'t worry too much about revving my Honda!  Thanks zzzoom6. :shades: The Accord is quite a contrast to the 6, that\\'s for sure.  In short, I don\\'t worry too much about revving my Honda! I agree 100% with that statement. Even though I loathed our \\'96 Civic for its lack of power anywhere south of 4000 RPM, it did rev willingly to the redline. We had problems with it almost everywhere else on the car, but the drive train required minimal maintenance even though we did rev it near the limit all the time just to climb hills and keep up with traffic. The only think I did differently was that I changed the oil more frequently. It did emit a burning oil smell from the tailpipe after a shorter period of time than other cars I\\'ve owned but I had no problem with that. Even that can be eliminated with different oils and additives now, neither of which were used by me. I just used plain old Pennzoil which isn\\'t exactly the greatest oil in the world anymore from what I\\'ve read.  In my opinion, the number of revolutions an engine has accumulated is less important in terms of overall durability than the design of the engine and most importantly, proper maintenance (especially when the difference between the average RPM is something like 2200 versus 3200, when redline is over 6000). Of course, any engine can be adversely affected by operating outside it\\'s design parameters. I think you are right, I think the wear on a well maintained motor with clean motor oil is minimal from additional RPMs. Technological improvements have allowed for much tighter and better controlled tolerances and much less variation in manufacturing, resulting in substancial decreases in weight and friction. Short of cold starts and engineering failures, there is very little metal to metal contact.  In particular, I would expect revs when cruising on the freeway to have a pretty insignifiacnt impact on engine life. The number of times it is started cold, regardless of the mileage driven would probably be a much bigger factor.Wouldn\\'t it be nice, for used car shoppers, if in addition to miles cars would count the number of starts?  Just a little pet peeve - RPM is already plural (Revolutions Per Minute) so you don\\'t need to add a \\'s\\' to the end. It\\'s additional RPM, not RPMs. And that wasn\\'t directed at you - I\\'ve seen it several times.  While engine design may very well minimize the effect of higher rpms, there can be little doubt that an engine wears faster at higher rpms than at lower rpms. It would very hard to conclude from this fact alone that the Saturn engine will last longer. But, its good food for thought. Nice post phaetondriver![edit -- sorry for the rpm\"s\" :P ]  You are right, I was thinking revs and typed RPMs. Valid point.  Things are not quite that simple in reality. A higher revving engine is expected to be engineered around the fact that it will rev higher and more often. One can bet that Honda\\'s F20C/F22C (S2000) uses greater design standards than the K24A (Accord) and both may last just a long, from wear and tear owing to RPM. Otherwise, one could make an argument that a 6AT will die before 4AT or 5AT does, as it requires more shifts.  That has always made me wonder about \"1 RPM\". :blush:  So the Aura engine will wear out at 300K, while the Honda wears out at 250K. That wouldn\\'t be enough to make me go with an Aura.  While engine design may very well minimize the effect of higher rpms, there can be little doubt that an engine wears faster at higher rpms than at lower rpms. It would very hard to conclude from this fact alone that the Saturn engine will last longer. But, its good food for thought.Food for thought and discussion is why I asked the question in the first place.I know most cars today have engines and transmissions that lasts for 100\\'s of thousands of miles when maintained properly and driven with care, which I am sure everyone on this forum does :blush: Fact: Every revolution of the engine causes some wear some place. Oil does not cover every part 100% of it\\'s surface when pressure is applied. Fact: Every revolution of the engine generates heat because of the parts rubbing against one another. If the parts didn\\'t rub against one another we wouldn\\'t need a radiator full of coolant or a water pump or an oil cooler or a transmission oil cooler.Wear might only a molecule or two per 1000 rev\\'s but it is still wear. A fact of life you can\\'t avoid, just do what you can to minimize it Point: Do whatever you can to reduce friction in the engine and transmission and the engine/trans will last even longer. As someone posted they will both probably last well over 250,000 Kilometers (how about 250,000 miles?). I use a PTFE based additive to help, it works to keep temps down and it helps with the gas mileage too.  But do you think all designs are created equal? Here is a food for thought, based on one of the \"facts\" you provided.Every revolution of the engine causes some wear some place. Oil does not cover every part 100% of it\\'s surface when pressure is applied. Honda B18C used in Integra GS-R had a unique honey-comb cylinder lining. It was engineered to rev higher than a typical engine is. You can\\'t apply a generic statement while ignoring facts like these.Would you say that Aura XR\\'s transmission having to shift 2-3 times more than XE\\'s for same effect will drastically reduce its durability? Or do you think the fact that it has to shift is already incorporated in the design?  All revolutions are not created equal. A rev in a warm engine cruising along at 2000 or 3000 rpm will cause less wear than a rev in a cold engine that has just started and is running at that same speed. Haven\\'t I read that the vast majority of engine wear occurs in the first couple miles after starting a cold engine???What if the engine life, if it is always warm and always running at 2000 is equivalent to 3,000,000 miles. Then if it runs at 3000 rpm instead, the same number of revs would get you 2,000,000 miles. In which case there is a difference but it is meaningless in the real world.  The flaw in your analogy is that your comparing two different transmissions. A 4sp and a 6sp auto. Looks like the comparison was on more equal footing when talking about the two V6 engines. Does the Accord have a honeycomb cylinder lining? Not that I\\'ve read. So far the facts show the Accord engine revs higher then the Aura\\'s. What major design advantages does the Accord V6 have to prove it would offset the wear of revving higher? VCM? Doesn\\'t all the stopping and starting cylinders actually cause more wear?  Ha, thank you.  \"MPGs\" gets me, also. And then there is the misused apostrophe problem, but I\\'d best not get started. :P  What major design advantages does the Accord V6 have to prove it would offset the wear of revving higher? VCM? Doesn\\'t all the stopping and starting cylinders actually cause more wear?A cylinder is a the hole the piston goes into; it doesn\\'t move, so it couldn\\'t be started or stopped. The piston goes up and down (or left and right if you are a Porsche or Subaru) and is connected to the crank via a connecting rod, which is pinned at the piston and bolted to the crank about a bearing. There is currently no healthy way for a single piston to be stopped in a multi-cylinder motor. It can be de-activated by cutting fuel and or spark (as a rev limiter does, except this would be on a single cylinder), but the piston would still travel the stroke of the cylinder. I would imagine Honda would use its VTEC control to hold the valves open during compression strokes to prevent more drag (or intake strokes to prevent vacuum), but oil pressure would remain constant so there would be no effective difference with respect to wear. If anything, the piston, pins, and crank bearings would last longer since they will not all be exposed to the force associated with combustion all the time.  Ha, thank you. \"MPGs\" gets me, also. And then there is the misused apostrophe problem, but I\\'d best not get started. I guess that would technically be MsPG, right?   I guess that would technically be MsPG, right?Either that or if MPGs is used, the follow-up question: How many gallons? should be asked  .  well, of course, a 4 cylinder engine revs higher to produce any given requirement for HP simply because there is almost always going to be less available torque. Torque is a number more directly related to an engine\\'s size, no. of cylinders(reciprocating mass) , and bore/stroke geometries. To assume that a V6 should last longer than a 4 is also strange - after all the V6 has more moving parts that might break. Further, I would also suggest that if we are talking about something like a Honda manufactured 4 banger vs. a GM V6, there are more than enough quality of materials differences and engineering acumen involved in the designs of the respective engines to sway any sort of longevity concerns in the direction of the Honda engine, IMO. But a fact generally supported by the reliability histories, I believe.  Why I am not surprised? So, you think comparing two transmissions is flawed but comparing two engines is valid. That sounds like a convenient assumption but seriously flawed.When an example is provided to illustrate a point, it shouldn&#146;t be taken to the point that you believe it is the same design that the example provided. Or else, you will continue to miss the point. No, the Accord V6 doesn&#146;t rev to 8000 rpm, so why must it?Or perhaps, I could feed the same medicine and stick to the &#147;only engines can be compared logic&#148;. Well, Accord&#146;s V6 is a simpler design, and it uses two camshafts versus four in Aura. Now, doesn&#146;t that make Aura V6 more vulnerable in that regard, with more moving parts? Or, is this argument flawed as well?VCM doesn&#146;t work the way you think it does. It works by keeping the pistons running and spark plugs are still fired. Only the valves are kept shut. This allows instantaneous transition into V6 mode (from I-3 or V4 mode) when needed. Why would this cause more wear than engine that has explosions going on in all pistons at all times?  What (and which post) were you laughing at? Share it with us.And while you still might be, why skip-shift in Corvette\\'s transmission? (In case you aren\\'t aware, it is a transmission logic to help improve EPA rating by 1-4 shift instead of traditional shifting pattern under low throttle situations which happens to encompass all but one of EPA\\'s test cycles).Please have a perspective before you speak.  Good list. I\\'d add the following:Budget/Value: Need to add the Fusion (starts around $15k real-world pricing) and also add the Elantra and Sentra--low-priced options for people who want mid-sized interior room but don\\'t mind an I4 and compact exterior dimensions.Reliability: I think you have to add the Camry I4 here--there\\'s nothing yet to suggest that it isn\\'t reliable. Also the Milan of course.Gas mileage--this is almost too close to call, with several cars e.g. Accord, Altima, Camry, Optima, Sonata being within about 1 mpg of each other. I suppose we could say the ultimate mpg champ here is the Prius (it IS mid-sized), and the Camry and Altima hybrids.Safety: Have to include the Accord here--it has top scores in all the IIHS tests and is one of their \"top picks\", and it has standard ESC with traction control across the lineup. I think the Sonata should get honorable mention because it\\'s the only car in the group other than the Accord to offer ESC + traction across the board.Ride comfort: really is personal, but I think the Fulan\\'s ride is quite nice also. Haven\\'t driven the Aura, Malibu, or Altima yet.  VCM doesn&#146;t work the way you think it does. It works by keeping the pistons running and spark plugs are still fired. Only the valves are kept shut. This allows instantaneous transition into V6 mode (from I-3 or V4 mode) when needed. Why would this cause more wear than engine that has explosions going on in all pistons at all times? Thanks for clarifying that. Should have done the research instead of making an assumption. I think the main pt. was that an engine that rev\\'s higher will cause more engine wear then another that rev\\'s lower? I think it would to some degree. Aren\\'t F1 engines lifespans drastically shorter since they rev really high?  F1 engines are race engines. Their is no need to design them to last longer than they do. Instead, focus is on making them lighter and smaller but with big power. Some of the experience does trickle down to \"normal\" cars.Like anything that is properly designed, engines are designed to exceed a tolerance level. And it is determined by the application. A higher revving engine will use a different spec than one that is lower revving design. In Honda\\'s world, F22C (S2000) would have been engineered to different specs and criterias than N22A (Accord Diesel). One redlines at 4500 rpm, the other will scream to 8000 rpm. The priorities are different, hence the design decisions. A 2.2-liter engine isn\\'t going to have same design regardless of how high or low it revs.This is fundamental to engineering anything well.  Fact: Every revolution of the engine generates heat because of the parts rubbing against one another. If the parts didn\\'t rub against one another we wouldn\\'t need a radiator full of coolant or a water pump or an oil cooler or a transmission oil cooler. If the friction from moving parts, was the only heat generated, an engine would not need a radiator. An oil pump and oil would suffice. It\\'s those explosions inside the cylinders, that make it necessary to use a radiator full of coolant.  I believe bhmr59 was referencing the statement you made \"Viper is geared that tall not because it has torque, but because its fuel economy would suck if it were geared shorter\", observing that in his opinion a Viper owner would not be concerned with FE.But it doesn\\'t matter because neither the Viper nor the Corvette are relevant to this discussion, so let\\'s drop this and get back to the subject.  No, I don\\'t think so, because the \"M\" in MPG already represents \"miles\". I like what jeffyscott said - MPGs means we should wonder miles per exactly how many gallons? Obviously more than one!  :P  Did I bring up Viper, and its \"excellent\" gas mileage?  You asked what the poster was talking about. I took a quote directly from this post: robertsmx, \"Midsize Sedans 2.0\" #7602, 28 Nov 2007 2:55 pm to answer your question and (attempt to) head off further off-topic discussion.Enough, please. If you have more to say, please email me, this does not belong here.  MPGs means we should wonder miles per exactly how many gallons? Obviously more than one!Only car I can think of the qualifies for M(singular)PG\\'s(plural) is a 3000+ HP top fuel dragster or alcohol dragster.They get about 20 gal/mile of fuel, not gasoline   You somehow missed this. Now, go ahead and delete this post for it being OT.  Here\\'s a good example of 8000 rpm and 300K miles co-existing on an original (1991) engine. This is currently a daily driver. And if you happen to be in Dallas-Ft Worth Area, an Acura dealership has an on-display car with over 700K miles to go with 8000 rpm.So, it ain\\'t all about rpm, but design and engineering, and considerations to durability. Besides, the last thing I would worry about in a Honda (Accord) will be its engine.  I have read this post over and over and I can\\'t figure it out.Honda B18C used in Integra GS-R had a unique honey-comb cylinder lining. It was engineered to rev higher than a typical engine is. You can\\'t apply a generic statement while ignoring facts like these.I don\\'t understand \"honey-comb lining.\" I am thinking it is something like the Crinkle Chrome applied to some cross county motorcycle racing engines back in the 70\\'s. It was a super smooth, supper hard, chrome-molly alloy plating with a spider web of microscopic fractures which held on to the oil better reducing friction of rings to cylinder walls.You mention \"apply generic statement while ignoring facts like these\" but I don\\'t see any facts in your statement.Are you saying that an engine with a honey-comb cylinder doesn\\'t have any friction anywhere in the engine? I know from your other posts you are way to knowledgeable to state an assumption like that and I won\\'t assume that is what you were saying. I just am missing the facts you elude to, I guess. Maybe you could describe the facts to me more clearly?Other post on this thread have made statements along the lines that RPM has no effect on Honda engines. Honda must have figured out how to completely eliminate metal on metal contact in an engine, which would be the greatest discovery of the 20th century, and maybe the 21st . With this technology we can solve the oil crisis because we wont need it for lubrication of anything in the future.   No I didn\\'t miss that - you addressed someone who had replied to you and asked why. I showed you why. My goodness you can make a mountain of a molehill!!  Could we please move on?  Other post on this thread have made statements along the lines that RPM has no effect on Honda engines.

With this technology we can solve the oil crisis because we wont need it for lubrication of anything in the future.I don\\'t think they own the market on reducing friction in an internal combustion or compression ignition motor. I think the design of the piston itself, the design of the cylinder wall, the way the rings seat and the material they are made of, and the coatings they use on the cylinders, pistons, and rings helps too. Modern con-rod bearings seem to show almost no wear after hundreds of thousands of miles if the oil was maintained.The Contour held 5.7 qts of oil while the Accord held 3.8 qts. Because the Contour was tracked, it got synthetic, but I didn\\'t have an issue with either one. I wanted to make sure there was something protecting the bearings when the vehicle was oil-starved during hard cornering, so synthetic seemed like the way to go. 180k later it was fine, and that was high load, high RPM driving.I personally am not worried about revs in a motor, as long as its within its factory limits (if you start reving a 7500 RPM redline motor to 10k you might have an issue). In my opinion, manufacturing tolerances are tight enough between all manufacturers.  Molehill Mountain That would be a great title for a blog.Suggestion for new topic for today\\'s discussion, \"Which midside car has the best automatic climate control system?\"I\\'ll start with saying the Mazda6 is not the winner.  Suggestion for new topic for today\\'s discussion, \"Which midside car has the best automatic climate control system?\" Never had it. Too entertaining to sit there and battle with Mrs. LilEngineerBoy over the temperature control knob. Okay, not really, but it wasn\\'t until recently that we had 2 cars that had Air Conditioning, let alone climate control.  I firmly believe that ANY modern engine whether build and designed by Honda or Hyundai or Ford (except the 3.8 V-6 of blown headgasket fame) or GM (except the original aluminum block Vega 4 cyl. OR the diesel V-8 conversion from the 80\\'s) or Chrysler will far outlast the original owner and probably several additional owners as well so questions of longevity up to at least 150K miles are a moot point. Of course, all talk of engine longevity is assuming the owner changes the oil, filters,plugs etc. once in a while and if one neglects even a Honda engine this will result in far reduced life. Anyhow, if you really want to talk high mileage I have had several and NONE were Honda. We had a 1988 Plymouth Horizon with 240K miles (2.2 liter 4 cyl.) a 1987 Taurus with perhaps the greatest engine Ford ever made...the Vulcan 3.0 V-6 that had a bit over 300K miles when sold and another 87 Taurus, same engine with 187 K miles when sold, a 1979 Subaru with over 300K miles when sold, and currently I drive a 1995 Dodge Stratus 2.5 liter V-6 that has 197,047 miles and counting....oh yeah, my son drives a 2000 Hyundai Elantra that had 172,167 miles when I last saw it and since he is racking up miles to the tune of 100 per day minimum probably a lot more now. All but the Horizon (which finally suffered a blown headgasket) were driven away and were used by the latest buyer when I sold them and all were reliable with no clanking or excessive oil use and all were as quiet as when they were 10\\'s of thousands of miles newer. All this to say Honda does not have a lock on engine reliability OR longevity.  On the list of things I don\\'t worry about, the longevity of my Accord\\'s engine is #1. On the list of things Honda knows, building engines is #1. Assuming that the Aura\\'s engine will last longer, because it will turn less rpm would be mistake, and I certainly would not bet on it.  >I firmly believe that ANY modern engine whether build and designed by Honda or Hyundai or Ford I agree with your post. You stated the point very well.  With regard to climate control, the auto. climate control on my 08 Accord EX-L works great and I have no complaints. Ms. Bug4 loves to put her temperature 10-12 degrees hotter than mine. The system handles the temperature gradient very well and, because the interior is so large or for whatever other reason, the system seems to be able to maintain significantly different temperatures from one side to the other. Other than its initial attempts to get the car up to temperature, I\\'m impressed with how quietly it operates! Now, having said that, I haven\\'t had anyone in the back seat for an extended trip. So, who knows, maybe the climate in the back seat is unbearable?? I am disappointed the new Accords don\\'t have any duct work to the back seats!  I find dual climate control to be useless. I\\'ve had two vehicles with dual climate control. The number of times I\\'ve used that feature over 6 years with two vehicles was about 4.Now, I find the heater element on the windshield on the Subaru under the wiper blades to be extraordinarily useful in the winter. You can\\'t get that feature on any car in this segment.  yea -- dual climate control is only useful if the passenger seat is occupied. I agree 1000% with your assessment of Subaru\\'s wiper heaters - that is a very nice feature!! Other manufacturers offer cold weather packages -- so I\\'m not sure why that is not included. Of course, Honda doesn\\'t package much of anything and so I\\'m not surprised that heater elements are not offered. Even in Wyoming, where I live, I would only \"need\" the elements 3-4 times per year. But they sure would be nice!! [Perhaps that is why every-other-car you see in Wyoming and Colorado is a Subaru  If I had to pick any one vehicle to drive on snow and ice, it would be an Outback! ]  the only thing that makes no sense is your apparent claim - that purchase price has anything to do with budget/value. It doesn\\'t, necessarily! Just because a Hyundai/Kia or Ford/Mercury are cheaper to buy does NOT make them any more (or less) of a value- it is cost to own that logically is the only thing that matters - and also a category that historically things like Camcordimas are cheaper in fact than the \\'Funatas\\' - and this is not any more subjective than FE ratings for example. Don\\'t understand why \\'value\\' or even \\'budget\\' are necessarily even used in the same sentence as \\'cheaper to buy\\' or \\'lower cost\\'. That, is certainly a faulty assumption. :confuse:  historically things like Camcordimas are cheaper in fact than the \\'Funatas\\' - and this is not any more subjective than FE ratings for example. This is your belief, not a known fact.In addition, even if true for some (such as those who trade cars every two years or those who overpay for \"Funatas\"), it is most certainly not true for all.  My 1996 Accord LX has ducts under the front seats, my 2006 Accord EX does as well. Surely the 2008 does too?These ducts are used when the front seats\\' ventilation has air/heat coming out of the floor.  Beliefs can stem from facts. When it comes to ownership costs, resale and initial costs aren\\'t the end. A lot of little costs add up over years and thousands of miles. Calculate, and you just might be surprised.  My 98 Accord also had ducts to the back seat. Although I haven\\'t actually looked at my own car, :confuse: , my understanding is that Honda skipped the ducts on the 08 models. Can anyone confirm this? Makes sense since the car is bigger and allegedly more luxurious than ever . . .. NOT!  ORyou can choose to believe the Intellichoices (or Edmunds\\') of the world that do put real numbers to these kind of things!  ORyou can simply trade in your Camcordima vs a Funata and see why yourself!  The engine will, in all probability, outlast the rest of the car in both the Accord and the Aura. You really believe that no other manufacturer can build a proper engine...only Honda?  I don\\'t think A/C vents in the rear are necessary in a car. With the middle dash vents pointed toward the center rear the air easily circulates throughout the interior. In something with a very large interior such as a van or large SUV, it may be necessary, but not in a car. I don\\'t have a problem cooling the rear seat of my Black car, even when the temperatures get to 100 degrees, here in the deep South.  **steps on soap box**One of my pet-peeves on these forums is when one member attributes a position to another member that the member never took. This is particularly problematic when, as is often the case, the position assigned is one that is absurd. I don\\'t need to come to anyone\\'s defense here. But, I don\\'t think anyone on this forum has ever said that \"no other manufacturer can build a proper engine...only Honda.\" We have some fairly reasonably-minded people on this forum. Sometimes that makes for boring conversation. But, so be it. IMHO, its better not to develop a controversy, and put forum members on the defense, by assigning positions to them that they never took. ** It has happened a bunch on the Accord forums over the last week and it creates dozens of posts that are interesting only to the 2-3 people engaged in the debate. Sorry -- I need to give back Pat his host\\'s job. . .** Steps off of soap box**  Assuming that the Aura\\'s engine will last longer, because it will turn less rpm would be mistake, and I certainly would not bet on it.Reread #7612. The assumption is yours that I said the Aura would last longer than the Honda. I could never say that, outright. I said if materials and maintenance were the same...What I was saying, and didn\\'t think it needed further explanation, is that the engine could last years longer, meaning, compared to the same engine turning several million more rev\\'s in it\\'s life time.It never fails to amaze me how so many car (Honda, Toyota, Mazda, Ford, Chevy or Yugo) owners will go to any length to defend their brand against a perceived attack, It\\'s like Killer Bee\\'s going after a dog because they think it is going to attach the hive :confuse: It\\'s been fun though   Phaetondriver stated that the Aura engine would last longer than the Accord engine due to the fact that at certain speeds the engine in the Accord is turning more rpm. I seriously doubt that is true. Of course if there is some proof, I would love to see it. Honda has a reputation for building durable engines, which is why people will pay more for anything with a Honda engine in it, than for the same product without one.  I think what happens is that when we can only communicate through written words, it\\'s very easy to misinterpret the writer\\'s intention. Without the tone of voice and facial cues that are available in a face to face conversation, it\\'s easy for the reader to take a fork in the road that wasn\\'t supposed to be there. I also think it\\'s good from time to time to set out some reality checks. You make some valid points.Actually, I think everyone here is reasonably-minded. We\\'re just passionate about that which we are reasonable. :P   The assumption is yours that I said the Aura would last longer than the Honda. I could never say that, outright. I said if materials and maintenance were the same... What I was saying, and didn\\'t think it needed further explanation, is that the engine could last years longer, meaning, compared to the same engine turning several million more rev\\'s in it\\'s life time. If you do not actually believe this statement is true, why say it? Even if the maintenance is the same, they are very different engines. You can make a lot of claims when you use IF this, and IF that, in every sentence.  If you do not actually believe this statement is true, why say it? Even if the maintenance is the same, they are very different engines. You can make a lot of claims when you use IF this, and IF that, in every sentence. I keep hearing Honda engines are very different. How so? What we are comparing are two internal combustion engines. Both are V6 with similiar displacement. WHAT shoots down the higher rev arguement. Advanced Honda engineering? OK, like what? To me when you put more stress on an engine for example, forced induction, there is increased wear thus less engine life.  If you do not actually believe this statement is true, why say it? Even if the maintenance is the same, they are very different enginesYou don\\'t think I was talking about the same engine? How about if I said if you drove your Honda with a rev limiter on the ignition that kept the engine below 5000 RPM and I drove An exact copy of that car built on the same day, in the same factory(s) and mine was limited at 7000 RPM.We drove the same roads in the same weather, same traffic, etc. and used the same oil changed at the same time, in the same shop, that your engine and mine would last exactly the same number of miles/years?Well without spelling it out in every detail that is what I was saying. I don\\'t have the history to back up a statement that the Cadillac 3.6 L engine will last for 2 years or 10. That it will last 50K or 500K miles. Thus I couldn\\'t and didn\\'t make such a statement. It was all the assumptions make because so many what to defend the Honda engine without trying to understand what has been written.If you had read what I wrote you would see that I have stated the Honda has a very reliable engine and Honda\\'s are very reliable cars. But as soon as I say that the Aura is good, or maybe better than a Honda, in anything, the defenders all rise to the call.Oh! BTW, Why is the Honda Powertrain Limited Warranty (years/miles) = 5/60,000.and the Cadillac/Aura XR for 5 years, or 100,000 miles/160,000 kms?  I concur, as my 1985 SAAB 900 naturally aspirated 2.0L SOHC I-4 - which by the way is smooth as silk - is over 250K miles with no engine corrective maintenance, and still is a daily driver. In fact, the only powertrain-specific corrective maintenance since purchase in April \\'85 was a new clutch at 120K miles. Honda is not alone in manufacturing a bullet-proof Inline 4. Ask older Volvo owners about the durability of the old B18 and B20 OHV Inline 4\\'s - their durability is legendary.  Suggestion for new topic for today\\'s discussion, \"Which midsize car has the best automatic climate control system?Difficult to say unless I tested them all. However, the Sebring I recently bought has a very nice one, IMHO. I just set every knob to \"A\" and it takes care of the rest.I\\'ve noticed that the fan doesn\\'t blow very hard the first minute or two when starting out on cold days. That keeps cold air from blowing on me. On warm days above 70F or so it directs more air out the instrument panel vents for more direct cooling on me. There\\'s just nothing so far about it that I don\\'t like.What don\\'t you like about the Mazda6 climate control?  the only thing that makes no sense is your apparent claim - that purchase price has anything to do with budget/value.I personally think that purchase price has a lot to do with \"budget/value, \" and I don\\'t think it\\'s nonsense to suggest that relationship. If one can purchase a mid-sized car for $5000-6000 less than another, and both cars have equivalent utility to that buyer, then the less expensive car has a huge head start in terms of total cost of ownership. When such a car, e.g. Fusion or Sonata, is also one of the most reliable in its class (e.g. per Consumer Reports), has a longer warranty than the more expensive cars in its class, and has similar fuel economy to the more expensive cars, then the main difference in cost of ownership is resale value. A $5000-6000 initial gap (and not including extra costs for taxes and interest, or opportunity costs) is very hard to make up just in resale value, especially if you keep a car more than a couple of years.If you think that\\'s nonsense and a faulty assumption, that\\'s fine. But I assure you that there is considerable thought, research, and experience behind my opinion.  Honda is not alone in manufacturing a bullet-proof Inline 4. Ask older Volvo owners about the durability of the old B18 and B20 OHV Inline 4\\'s - their durability is legendary.Or the Toyota 22r. Or the MBZ 5 cylinder diesel. Or the BMW ETA in the 3 and 5 series.  If one can purchase a mid-sized car for $5000-6000 less than another, and both cars have equivalent utility to that buyer, then the less expensive car has a huge head start in terms of total cost of ownershipOf course, this is true - and the longer anybody keeps anything the lesser the difference in residual values. Therefore, over 10 years let\\'s say, the Funata not only saved you the $5 grand but also the interest cost of financing the extra money over some period of time. BUT, given that the average new car buyer only keeps (or leases a car) for 3 or 4 years, then the difference in those residual values is significant enough to make the Camcordima a better \\'value\\' if a \\'better value\\' is to be defined as \\'total cost to own\\'. At least this is what those folks (Intellichoice/Edmunds) that study these kind of things say. Why, if this is not true - is it as cheap or cheaper to lease an Accord for example (3-4 year lease) as it can be to lease a Fusion that the leasing company is going to pay a few thousand less for? The word is VALUE. It\\'s a simple concept really except for those folks that seem to equate a cheap initial price with \\'cheap to own\\'. Now If the Fusion,for example, becomes the first Ford branded car in recent history to hold its value well because it becomes a hot commodity as a used car for reliability reasons, then that would certainly help to make the car a possibly better value than the Accord. Historically this has not been the case - the Camcords, in particular, lead the pack not only in higher initial price but also in lowest cost to own. A contradiction - not exactly.  At least this is what those folks (Intellichoice/Edmunds) that study these kind of things say. Why, if this is not true - is it as cheap or cheaper to lease an Accord for example (3-4 year lease) as it can be to lease a Fusion that the leasing company is going to pay a few thousand less for?Leasing is a bad example, IMHO. The leases on the Fusion and the Mazda6 were both cheaper than the lease on the Accord. The Accord was more out of pocket and a higher payment. This becomes even more true when you take into account the actual transaction price for me to purchase the Accord. One of the reasons I went with the Accord is because I wasn\\'t planning on having the car long, so hopefully it will maintain its value well.  Yes, I agree, at least wrt the Accord. Accord leases start at $259/mo. plus over $2000 up front for the basic LX model. Milans that are better equipped go for around $220/mo. with less up front, and Sonata GLSes have had lease deals around $200/month with anywhere from 0 to $2000 up front for quite a while. I did see some recent ads for Camry LE leases at $184/mo. with about $2000 up front, so the Camry at least is a good value in terms of leasing. Accord, not very much.  Agree with you - lease costs, as you note, are dependent on several factors but it also remains true that the lease cost is based on the cost for the leasing co. to buy the car less the value of the car over a usually short period of time. If you found the Accord more expensive to lease than the Fusion/6 I would suggest that it could have been Ford subsidizing the lease to a greater degree than Honda. Leasing costs, in general, however, a poor way to \\'know\\' what anybody is truly paying for anything, too many variables. On a strictly \\'dollars lost to depreciation\\' consideration the 2 cars finish very close to equal over a shorter (more common) time period so therefore the Accord is about the same \\'value\\' as that less expensive Fusion if we also assume that the reliabilties/maintanence costs are also close - something I think is logical over the first few years.  Take a look at Edmund\\'s TCOs for the Sonata GLS and Accord LX for example. There is a whopping 1 cent per mile difference over five years. Note also that the difference in resale value shinks from a little over $5k in year 1 to a little over $3k in year 5. Interesting. What do you suppose will happen after year 5? I suspect the difference will continue to shrink. But you\\'ve pocketed the up-front savings immediately. With the Accord, you don\\'t see any extra \"value\" until you sell the car.It\\'s also important to view these general TCOs through a personal filter. For example, suppose someone decided to go for the 0% interest over 5 years plus $500 rebate on the Sonata instead of the $1000 general rebate. According to Edmund\\'s TCO numbers, they\\'d save about $3500 in financing costs over five years, at the expense of $500 less rebate up front--so about $3000 additional savings (4 cents a mile) over five years. What if in addition they already own a Hyundai and get the $500 loyalty rebate? Now it\\'s close to another 5 cents a mile lower in TCO.So the moral is, don\\'t blindly trust the general TCO numbers. Be sure they fit your individual circumstances.  Therefore, over 10 years let\\'s say, the Funata not only saved you the $5 grand but also the interest cost of financing the extra money over some period of time. BUT, given that the average new car buyer only keeps (or leases a car) for 3 or 4 years, then the difference in those residual values is significant enough to make the Camcordima a better \\'value\\' if a \\'better value\\' is to be defined as \\'total cost to own\\'. Yes the more expenisve car can sometimes be a better value for short-term owners. I would no rely on edmunds or intellichoice to determine this as the figures they use are often erroneous. Anyway, when this is the case (that the more expensive car is cheaper to own) there is usually a crossover point where the cheaper car becomes cheaper overall, as you have acknoledged. So then, if this is an important factor to someone, the information needed is where is the crossover point and how long do they plan to keep the car. If for example the crossover is at 3, then for the person who trades in 2 the answer to the question \"which will cost me less?\" is different from the person who keeps the car 5 years. For those like me who keep cars 10+ years, we can be pretty sure that we will pass any crossover point.If the average new car is traded at 3-4 years, this does not mean that every buyer does this. In fact it does not even mean that the average person does it, since one who trades every 3 years will buy 4 cars in 12 years while I may buy only one in 12 years. The average car bought by the two of us will have been owned for 4.8 years (4 owned for 3 years and one for 12 = 4.8 years on average) while the average ownership time for the two of us will be 7.5 years (one person owns for 3 and the other for 12 years).  Take a look at Edmund\\'s TCOs for the Sonata GLS and Accord LX for example. There is a whopping 1 cent per mile difference over five years.and that is really all I\\'m saying here: the Camcordima is not necessarily any more expensive to own or any less of a \\'value\\' than possibly even that Sonata which definitely costs a whole lot less to buy. And yes, if you examine some of these \\'cost-to-own\\' numbers they can overstate initial purchase price especially among those cars that tend to be discounted heavily. The Mazda 6\\'s TCO was based on a purchase price at invoice but a few months into the 06-07 models the car was being sold for a coupla thousand UNDER invoice (something that the Edmunds\\' (or Mazda) can not anticipate) - but also something that would reduce TCO if (and that\\'s the problem) the car maintains its resale value. My contention, in this case would be, of course, that any \\'fire sale\\' pricing hurts resale values in a similar way so therefore TCO is largely uneffected.  no problem with any of this at all - if you can keep either car running for 10 years and let\\'s say 200k then the one that costs less to buy intially is undoubtedly a better \\'value\\' if all other factors (maintanence and FE) are equal- the kicker being of course that very few of us new car buyers do this.  Well, it helps that for me 10 years would be more like 80-100K mi.   You don\\'t think I was talking about the same engine? How about if I said if you drove your Honda with a rev limiter on the ignition that kept the engine below 5000 RPM and I drove An exact copy of that car built on the same day, in the same factory(s) and mine was limited at 7000 RPM. We drove the same roads in the same weather, same traffic, etc. and used the same oil changed at the same time, in the same shop, that your engine and mine would last exactly the same number of miles/years? No, I don\\'t think you were talking about the same engine. You insinuated that the Aura engine would last longer than the Accord engine, because it turned less rpm over time. I disagreed with that statement. They are both V6 engines, and close to the same displacement, but that\\'s where the similarities end. Not the same engine.  Oh! BTW, Why is the Honda Powertrain Limited Warranty (years/miles) = 5/60,000. and the Cadillac/Aura XR for 5 years, or 100,000 miles/160,000 kms?Because people wouldn\\'t buy them otherwise. It\\'s a way to pull in customers who might be hesitant about buying GM products.  You insinuated NO! YOU ASSUMED, without reading what I wrote (twice), which seems to happen all to much when one is in constant defense mode of his favorite brand. FACT: If you run one engine at a lower RPM it will last longer than THE SAME engine run at higher RPM. Unless it is a HONDA which will last longer run at higher a RPM, rather than a lower one, if you can believe the Honda owners in this forum.  Because people wouldn\\'t buy them otherwise. It\\'s a way to pull in customers who might be hesitant about buying GM products.Funny! Not true, but a good try  Funny! Not true, but a good tryIt\\'s not funny unfortunately, it\\'s why I believe they did this. Can you show otherwise? Maybe they are an altruistic organization who want to take care of their customers?  I agree. Hyundai did the same thing, offered an extraordinary warranty to attract purchasers and improve its image.  I think that Backy`s post #7683 puts this subject in a great macro context and warrants everyones careful consideration . It does however raise an interesting question. There is little doubt that dealers have historically been prepared to pay very good prices for used Accords, either in the wholesale and auction markets or to those wishing to \"trade -up\" to a newer model. They obviously do so on the basis that the buying public are prepared to pay an even higher price for the car in the used car lot ! Is there any reason to believe that this might change going forward ? Will the buying public be willing to pay so dearly for used product when they can buy NEW product for only slightly more ? It seems to me that the willingness of Honda(and Toyota) dealers to now sell new product at less than Invoice when manufacturer incentives are available is something new to the car market - and that it will work to change the \"resale value\" for Accord owners going forward. Ant thoughts on this?  GM warranty -- GMs extended warranty on their powertrain is marketing, for sure, but I\\'m not sure it is purely a marketing ploy. I\\'ll bet GM learned their lesson in the 1980\\'s when all the big american manufacturers just about put themselves out of business by getting into a war on warranties. If I remember correctly, you could get a Chevy 1500 or Ford F150 pickup with a 75,000 mile warranty on the powertrain (maybe it even got up to 100,000 miles). That came back to bite them BIG TIME about 5 years later!! I personally don\\'t think GM would make that mistake twice. GM would not offer a 5 yr warranty if it meant they would loose $$ on the vehicle . . I think they must believe that their Cadillac/Aura is reliable for that period of time. [Interestingly, from what I understand, this issue is related to the wide availability of impressive performance chips that substantially boost horse power. I had one installed on a 2003 Tahoe and was perplexed as to why Chevy didn\\'t do it in the first place. The answer was simple, Chevy was unwilling to accept the additional warranty work that would result from every incremental increase in power. At some magic number, the increased sales generated by marketing a more powerful truck are outweighed by the cost of increased warranty work for a more powerful truck. There is a huge economic incentive for the makers of mass-produced vehicles to dance a fine line and to not push the envelope of reliability (i.e. they can\\'t push the envelope of performance). Cars and trucks likely can be made more efficient, lighter and more powerful. But, not when it jeopardizes the costs of warranty work. Who knows, maybe we all could be driving much more satisfying vehicles (at least in the short-term), if we were willing to accept shorter warranty periods  ]  I agree. Hyundai did the same thing, offered an extraordinary warranty to attract purchasers and improve its image.As has Chrysler recently. Laying a crazy-long warranty on your product is absolutely a marketing tool, especially for brands with past(or current) bad reps and/or brands like Hyundai/Kia that are trying to make conquest sales.You could argue the other side of the coin with Honda & Toyota, both have built stellar reliability reps and don\\'t need the extra enticement of 100k warranties.Just my opinion.  You could argue the other side of the coin with Honda & Toyota, both have built stellar reliability reps and don\\'t need the extra enticement of 100k warranties.So, If all Honda are so reliable that they can easily run well over 100,000 miles with any failures, Why doesn\\'t Honda warrant the power train for at least 100,00 miles.If GM power trains are so unreliable they would be stupid to offer a warranty that goes far past the expected life of the engine or it\\'s major components. Can I assume you think GM is a stupid car manufacturer? You fully expect that the Cadillac/Buick/Aura/Malibu\\'s will all fall apart in about 40K to 50 K Miles because GM can\\'t possibly build an engine as reliable as a Japanese or Korean, or German, or Swedish car company? The fact that there are millions more GM cars on the road with over 100K miles on them than Honda\\'s, Toyota\\'s, or Nissan\\'s means nothing.I don\\'t believe that GM would put a warranty on a car that it didn\\'t fully expect the car or power train to live past.  If all Honda are so reliable that they can easily run well over 100,000 miles with any failures, Why doesn\\'t Honda warrant the power train for at least 100,00 miles.Because they don\\'t need to. It\\'s a sales ploy and a manufacturer\\'s attempt to say hey, look here, we\\'re a lot better than you think we are. It has worked well for Hyundai. I will be interesting to see how well it works for GM.I don\\'t believe that GM would put a warranty on a car that it didn\\'t fully expect the car or power train to live past.That is exactly the point GM wants to make. It\\'s a good thing!  Because they don\\'t need to. It\\'s a sales ploy...So why does Honda offer any warranty at all?They never break and no repairs, due to manufacturing defects, ever need to be done. Heck, I guess they don\\'t even need a service department at the dealership, just an oil change pit.Get real.  Hey, just trying to explain what\\'s going on. No need to take offense.Maybe on this note we should get back to the actual cars themselves, since they are the subject here, not the manufacturers\\' warranty policies.  Interesting, Thats 39000 Rev\\'s per hour the XR saves compared to the Accord V6AT. That could be over 500,000 Rev\\'s per 1000 miles. or 7.6 million rev\\'s per year (15k miles per year), That could mean a couple years more life for the Saturn engine.If you were to look at only the last sentence, you could say you meant one Saturn engine would last a couple of years longer than another Saturn engine, which turned 7.6 million rpm more per year. But you didn\\'t stop there, read on. That would be true if the engines were made of the same materials and maintenance was the same, and all the driving was done at 70 MPH, etc. etc. etc. Why would one Saturn engine be made of different materials than another? They are not, so you are obviously talking about two different engines at this point. Also, all driving is not done at 70mph, etc. etc. etc. so what\\'s the point?Just food for thoughtNo, just a load of crap.  and I would be the opposite, driving about 30k/year. Would suspect that my repairs tend to be mileage related while any problems you might have would be age related? That said ,it is your cars that would hold value substantially better and longer than normal making one of those \\'Japanese\\' brands an obvious choice. A 1997 Accord with only 80k on it is going to be attractive to somebody, more so than if it was a 10 year old Korean or American branded car.  I guess, from what has been stated here, that wouldn\\'t be true. Honda has found a way to build an engine that doesn\\'t wear it\\'s bearings, bushings, or rings.My mistake. The Honda turning 7+ million more rev\\'s without any wear would mean the Saturn wouldn\\'t get a couple more years. You see, when I wrote that I was unaware that Honda engines don\\'t wear out any internal parts, and it is irrelevant what RPM the engine is turning at any given speed.I might be slow at learning this lesson, because I have had to rebuild 4 domestic engines and 2 Japanese engines, but none were Honda\\'s Now I know why.But the Cadillac 3.6 L V6 engine isn\\'t built with Honda technology so it will wear out, someday. If it wears some part out at 99K miles it will be covered by the warranty. Something Honda owners don\\'t need.  But don\\'t you (any many others) agree that Korean and USA car have made quantum leaps in quality and reliability since the 1997 model year?Regarding your earlier post (forgive me if it was someone else) regarding TCO. I have found these reports to be inaccurate based upon the \"cash price\" and a double hit on taxes in the first year. Edmund\\'s current TCO bases it\\'s assumption on a 2007 Sonata SE (bought in Nov.) at ~ $2700 higher than we paid in Feb. \\'07 for the same car (no option package). And, the rebates on an \\'07 are higher now, with the new model year being out, than they were ten months ago.We paid $16,651 plus $189 doc fee, plus registration, whatever fees, plus 6% sales tax for an OTD of $18,189. The TCO shows this car OTD at $20,934.  While it seems mpg and mph is dominating this post.... lets go back a lil. I give Mazda respect on its Euro model.... but the current Mazda6 is wack. Call it what you want... but its exterior is not superior. Your comparative pics were humorous. Its like when they advertise make up on info-mercials. The first pic is of the chic with no make up, and an ugly frown. And the second pic is with the makeup and a cool-aid smile. Be fair at least. Here\\'s a better comparison.  It has always amazed me that there are shoppers out there who will pay more for a used Accord or Camry than a new one costs. Then, in addition, they get hit with the higher used car interest rates. The dealers have got to laughing all the way to the bank.Regards:OldCEM '"
